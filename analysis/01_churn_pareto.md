# The 11 Reasons People Leave Their Answering Service

We tagged every churn quote with a specific reason. Not "they were bad" — a specific, actionable failure. Then we weighted them: a detailed Reddit post with 50 upvotes carries more weight than a one-liner on Trustpilot.

Here's the ranked list. The top 6 reasons account for 76% of all churn.

---

**#1. Script Failures — 19.3% (32 quotes)**
The receptionist doesn't follow the script. This is the single biggest reason people leave. Customers say things like "they don't read directions" and "I've sent the same instructions five times." For a shared-pool human service, this is structural — one person juggles hundreds of client scripts. AI doesn't have this problem.

**#2. Inauthenticity — 16.1% (15 quotes)**
Callers can tell it's an answering service. The receptionist "didn't know what to do," couldn't answer basic questions, sounded robotic. Fewer quotes than #1, but the quotes are longer and more detailed (hence higher weighted share). These are customers who feel embarrassed.

**#3. Predatory Billing — 13.7% (21 quotes)**
Charging for spam calls. Billing for hold time. "After-call work" fees that inflate every invoice. This isn't "too expensive" — it's customers feeling scammed. AnswerConnect and Smith.ai over-index here.

**#4. Serial Switching — 9.8% (15 quotes)**
"I've tried 4 other companies." These customers have given up on the entire category. They're the highest-intent prospects for Central AI — they've already proven they'll pay for this service, they just haven't found one that works.

**#5. Billing Trap — 9.4% (15 quotes)**
Can't cancel. Charged after cancellation. 30-day notice requirements buried in terms. Smith.ai is the worst offender — customers describe "intentionally difficult" cancellation processes.

**#6. Garbled Info — 7.7% (14 quotes)**
Wrong phone numbers. Misspelled names. Missed email addresses. "Phone number, address, email all wrong." AnswerConnect dominates here. For a service whose entire job is capturing information, this is damning.

Below the 76% line:

**#7. Quality Decay — 7.2%** | "Used to be great, now it's terrible." Ruby and Synthflow both hit here.
**#8. Opaque Billing — 6.1%** | Surprise charges, hidden fees, can't see your usage.
**#9. Missed Calls — 4.3%** | The phone just rings. Nobody picks up.
**#10. Too Expensive — 4.0%** | Straightforward price sensitivity. Smallest billing category.
**#11. Routing Errors — 2.5%** | Wrong technician dispatched, calls sent to voicemail instead of forwarded.

The pattern: the core product promise (handle my calls correctly) fails 45% of the time. The business model (billing) fails 33% of the time. Together, that's 79% of churn mapping to problems where AI has a structural edge.
