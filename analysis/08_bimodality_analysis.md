# The Barbell: Why the Star Ratings Are Misleading

Here's a simple test for whether a company's reviews are healthy: look at the distribution. If customers have mixed experiences, you'd expect reviews spread across 1 through 5 stars — some great, some bad, a bunch in the middle.

That's not what we see.

## These reviews cluster at the extremes

| Competitor | % Extreme (1-star or 5-star only) | Unprompted 5-star | Recent 5-star |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Smith.ai | **95%** | 0 of 13 | 49 of 60 |
| AnswerConnect | **75%** | 0 of 38 | 59 of 67 |
| Ruby | **70%** | 10 of 56 | 41 of 46 |
| PATLive | **68%** | 38 of 72 | 16 of 16 |

**Smith.ai is the most extreme.** 95% of all their reviews are either 1-star or 5-star. Almost nobody gives them a 2, 3, or 4. Before mid-2024, they had zero five-star reviews on Trustpilot. Then suddenly, 49 appeared. That's two completely separate populations leaving reviews — genuinely unhappy customers and what looks like a solicited review program.

**AnswerConnect and Ruby show the same pattern.** Zero organic 5-stars for AnswerConnect. Ruby had a small base of real 5-star reviews (10 of 56), but the recent wave (41 of 46) dwarfs it.

**PATLive is the exception.** They had real 5-star reviews even before the recent surge (38 of 72). Their distribution is still extreme (68%), but there's a genuine base of satisfied customers underneath.

## What a "barbell" distribution means

A distribution that's heavy at 1-star and 5-star with nothing in the middle is a classic fingerprint of two separate populations reviewing the same company:

1. **Customers with genuine problems** — posting organically because they're frustrated
2. **Customers asked to review** — prompted by the company, typically satisfied or neutral

Neither group is "fake." But when you average them together, you get a misleading 3.5-4.0 star rating that represents nobody's actual experience. The unhappy customers are having a 1-star experience. The prompted reviewers are having a fine-but-unremarkable experience. The 3.7 average is an artifact.

## For Central AI

Don't benchmark against these headline ratings. The real competitive landscape is much weaker than Trustpilot suggests. Position against the *organic* experience (1.2 to 3.8 stars), not the inflated composite score.
