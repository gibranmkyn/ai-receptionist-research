# Each Competitor Fails Differently

Not all answering services break the same way. When you look at the churn profile for each competitor, clear patterns emerge — and each one suggests a different attack angle for Central AI.

---

**AnswerConnect is a call handling disaster.** 69% of their churn is call handling — the highest of any competitor. Their receptionists can't follow scripts, can't capture information accurately, and sound like robots reading from a screen. If you're targeting AnswerConnect customers, lead with "AI that actually follows the script."

**Ruby Receptionist is decaying.** 44% call handling, 33% billing, 17% service reliability. Ruby's churn is the most broadly distributed — customers are unhappy about *everything*. The quality decay signal is strongest here: longtime customers who loved Ruby for years and are now watching it fall apart. "Used to be great, now it's terrible."

**Smith.ai has a billing problem.** 43% of their churn is billing — the highest billing concentration of any competitor. Script failures (30%) plus billing traps (17%) are their top two complaints. Customers describe "intentionally difficult" cancellation and surprise charges.

**PATLive is the jack of all trades, master of none.** 36% call handling, 29% billing, 21% reliability, 14% industry disillusionment. No single dominant failure mode — they're mediocre across the board. They also have the most serial switchers, meaning PATLive catches customers fleeing other services.

**Synthflow is the AI cautionary tale.** Only 12% call handling (AI solved that), but 47% billing and 35% reliability. AI-native doesn't mean churn-free — it means the failure mode shifts from "the person couldn't follow the script" to "the platform crashed and nobody responded for six days."

| Competitor | Call Handling | Billing | Reliability | Disillusionment | n |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AnswerConnect | **69%** | 25% | 6% | 0% | 36 |
| Ruby | 44% | 33% | 17% | 6% | 36 |
| Smith.ai | 39% | **43%** | 9% | 9% | 23 |
| PATLive | 36% | 29% | 21% | 14% | 28 |
| Synthflow | 12% | **47%** | **35%** | 6% | 17 |

**Legacy average vs Synthflow** — the AI comparison:

| Group | Legacy Avg | Synthflow |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Call Handling | 47% | 12% |
| Billing | 33% | 47% |
| Reliability | 13% | 35% |
| Disillusionment | 7% | 6% |

AI kills call handling churn. But it creates billing and reliability churn if you're not careful. Central AI has to avoid *both* failure modes.
