# Which Industries Are Hurting the Most?

Only 26 of our 154 churn quotes mention a specific industry. But when they do, one vertical dominates.

**Legal makes up 69% of all identified industry mentions.** 18 of 26 quotes with an industry tag come from law firms. Their top complaint? Script failures — receptionists who can't handle legal intake properly. Makes sense. Legal calls require precise information capture (case type, opposing party, deadlines), and a shared-pool receptionist who also handles HVAC appointments is never going to get it right.

**Medical is a distant second at 19%** (5 quotes). Their pain is different — it's about inauthenticity. Patients call a doctor's office and can tell they're talking to an outsourced call center. For a medical practice, that erodes trust immediately.

**Home services** (8%, 2 quotes) complain about routing — the technician dispatch is wrong. **Real estate** (4%, 1 quote) is a serial switcher who tried multiple AI solutions.

| Industry | Quotes | % | Top Pain |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Legal | 18 | 69% | Script Failures |
| Medical | 5 | 19% | Inauthenticity |
| Home Services | 2 | 8% | Routing Errors |
| Real Estate | 1 | 4% | Serial Switching |

**Now, the caveat you should know:** All 12 Reddit churn quotes come from r/LawFirm. The other subreddits we scraped (r/VOIP, r/smallbusiness, r/Dentistry, r/legaltech, r/SaaS, r/agency) produced zero churn quotes. So "legal dominates" partly reflects where we found signal, not necessarily where all the pain is.

That said, it's still a strong starting point. Lawyers are vocal, they pay premium rates ($300-$2,800/mo), and their call handling requirements (intake forms, conflict checks, scheduling) are exactly the kind of structured task AI handles well.

**Recommendation:** Start with legal. Expand to medical and home services as the product matures.
