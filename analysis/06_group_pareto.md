# The Four Ways Answering Services Fail

The 11 churn reasons cluster naturally into four groups. Each group is a different kind of failure, and each one suggests a different product response.

---

## Group 1: Call Handling — 45.5% of all churn (66 quotes)

This is the big one. Nearly half of all churn comes from the calls themselves being handled badly.

The breakdown inside:
- **Script Failures** (32 quotes, 48% of group) — "They don't read directions." The most common single complaint in the entire dataset.
- **Inauthenticity** (15 quotes, 23%) — "They didn't know what to do." Callers can tell it's an answering service.
- **Garbled Info** (14 quotes, 21%) — "Phone number, address, email all wrong." The receptionist captures information incorrectly.
- **Routing Errors** (5 quotes, 8%) — "Called the wrong tech, didn't check the schedule."

This group is where AI has the clearest structural advantage. A model trained on your specific business can follow a script perfectly every time. It doesn't forget, doesn't get tired, doesn't juggle 200 other clients.

## Group 2: Billing — 33.2% of all churn (51 quotes)

One in three churners leaves because of how they were billed, not how calls were handled.

- **Predatory Billing** (21 quotes, 41% of group) — Charging for spam calls, inflating call times, "after-call work" fees.
- **Billing Trap** (15 quotes, 29%) — Charged after cancellation, impossible to cancel, 30-day notice requirements.
- **Opaque Billing** (11 quotes, 22%) — Surprise charges, can't see your usage, promised rate doesn't match invoice.
- **Too Expensive** (4 quotes, 8%) — Straightforward price sensitivity. The smallest sub-category.

Notice: "too expensive" is the *smallest* billing complaint. People aren't leaving because the service costs too much — they're leaving because they feel cheated. Transparent pricing isn't just a nice-to-have. It's a competitive moat.

## Group 3: Service Reliability — 11.5% of all churn (22 quotes)

Services that start strong and deteriorate over time.

- **Quality Decay** (14 quotes, 64% of group) — "Used to be great, now it's terrible." Ruby customers are especially vocal here.
- **Missed Calls** (8 quotes, 36%) — Phone rings and nobody picks up. For an answering service, this is existential.

This is a warning for Central AI too. Synthflow — an AI-native competitor — has 35% of its churn in this group. Platform instability and silent breaking updates are the AI equivalent of staff turnover. Year 3 quality needs to equal Day 1 quality.

## Group 4: Industry Disillusionment — 9.8% of all churn (15 quotes)

- **Serial Switching** (15 quotes, 100% of group) — "I've tried 4 other companies."

These customers have tried everything. They've been through Ruby, then Smith.ai, then PATLive, then back again. They're the most skeptical prospects but also the highest-intent. They've already proven they'll pay for this service — they just need one that actually works.

Position Central AI as fundamentally different technology, not "another answering service."
