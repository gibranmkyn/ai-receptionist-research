## Script Failures (32 quotes, 19.3%) — "They don't read directions"

**#1** | Conversational | Quality: 4/5 | Reddit

*Answering service agents don't follow scripts, have a quality ceiling, and lack business knowledge; recommends a dedicated remote receptionist over any agency for better outcomes.*

> I've used conversational answering service for years. It's much better than when I started with nobody but they do have a ceiling. This service does not follow a script. They will do bookings for you but combined with them not following a script it makes quality control on the bookings difficult as they are operating without solid guardrails of what your criteria are. If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

**#2** | PATLive | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Previous call center constantly said 'we can't do that'; PATLive offered customization for call handling including scheduling, forwarding, spam marking, and CRM lead entry*

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.  I had been wi...

## Inauthenticity (15 quotes, 16.1%) — "They didn't know what to do"

**#1** | Virtual HQ | Quality: 5/5 | Reddit

*Phone answering service missed 1 in 5 calls, clients never got the same receptionist, and existing clients were grumpy being met with an answering service instead of someone who knew them*

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.  I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).  1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 ou...

**#2** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 5/5 | Reddit

*Ruby used as overflow for 500 calls/month but people can still tell the difference between in-house staff and the call service, and conversions are much better with own people answering*

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish.   We get about 500 inbound calls per month.   We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume.   I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory.   But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conve...

## Predatory Billing (21 quotes, 13.7%) — "They charged me for spam calls"

**#1** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Charged for calls to a recycled phone number unrelated to the business, billed over $30 for internal testing during an upgrade, and lost a day of customer calls due to flawed setup.*

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.    I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only ...

**#2** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Upsold to a plan costing $700/month more than needed; support was unreachable; company overcharged by over $3,000 over 5 months.*

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someo...

## Serial Switching (15 quotes, 9.8%) — "I've tried 4 other companies"

**#1** | Other | Quality: 3/5 | Reddit

*Lawyer has tried multiple answering services and is unhappy with all of them, seeking recommendations for a virtual receptionist that integrates with Google Ads.*

> Best virtual receptionist/google ads  Hey just wondering if 1) anyone can make a recc for an answering service they have had success with and 2) how well this worked with a google ad campaign. I’ve used a few services and am not happy with them. Any feedback greatly appreciated. Thanks.

**#2** | Smith.ai | Quality: 3/5 | Reddit

*Law firm switched from a live receptionist to Smith AI to cut costs and never looked back.*

> first, that is the third split as mentioned above is probably better.   sounds like with two full-time staffers he has over 100 cases or more?   how many work for you?   if you’re looking to cut costs, could you cut his staff by one?  do you have live receptionist? we went to smith AI and never looked back

## Billing Trap (15 quotes, 9.4%) — "Cannot cancel. They make you email to request cancellation!!"

**#1** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without consent raising the bill; settings don't save; cancellation process is intentionally difficult.*

> The AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without my consent which will raise my bill. Does not save settings. Super dishonest business. Cannot cancel. They make you email to request cancellation!! I had to dig for their phone number only to talk to a receptionist who can't cancel for me! Now I have to wait for a call and hopefully they will cancel. Never again! If you need an AI receptionist look elsewhere.

**#2** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*AI sounds like a live human but too many kinks; lost calls during trial; dishonest cancellation policy requiring 30 days notice even after risk-free trial promise.*

> Buyer beware.  The ai actually sound like a live human.  That’s what got my attention.  The actual humans behind them not so great.    I quickly realized this wasn’t what we were looking for and canceled but was then contacted by Jorge, an associate at Smith Ai.  He said I could try it risk free for 30 days and suggested an onboarding call to show us how to train and use our Ai. We agreed and tried it for a couple weeks but there are just too many kinks needing worked out still.  We ended up los...

## Garbled Info (14 quotes, 7.7%) — "Phone number, address, email all wrong"

**#1** | AnswerConnect | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Virtual receptionist routinely captures wrong phone numbers, addresses, and emails; customers hang up due to painful experience; would switch if an alternative existed.*

> They are a must have for my business.  If I found someone that was not as sloppy in execution I would switch over to them.   Yesterday for example I had one customer appointment where the phone number, address, and email were all wrong.   This routinely happens.  Today, I had a customer that I had to respell their name again because it was taken wrong (this happens frequently).  Yesterday I had a customer hang up because it was too painful to get to a point that they could tell them the avai...

**#2** | PATLive | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Answering service bill is 7-10x the expected budget; agents continually misspell names, emails, and addresses despite the critical importance of accuracy.*

> Accurate information is extremely important.  We continually receive misspelled names, emails, addresses from the agents.  I know not all callers are happy to share but we can’t be guessing either.  Also had a budget in mind for what I would pay for this service and the bill has remained 7-10 times over that price every month.  I have really low expectations, just trying to survive in a sea of complications so would like to eliminate all internal obstacles.  We are stubbornly hanging on hoping f...

## Quality Decay (14 quotes, 7.2%) — "Used to be great, now it's terrible"

**#1** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Long-time Smith.ai customer (8 years) reports significant quality decline in the last year: disorganized departments, no ownership of issues, delayed responses, and impossible to reach decision-makers.*

> Smith.ai used to be fantastic, they have been our answering service of choice for over 8 years. Within the last year their quality has declined significantly. Their departments are unorganized, there's no ownership for handling actual customer issues, response time on the back end is significantly delayed. Ironically, attempting to talk with someone who has any authority to make a decision is impossible. Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more...

**#2** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*After 5 years, service deteriorated with failed callbacks costing potentially hundreds of thousands in lost revenue; company only offers $10 credits for major errors.*

> This is now the fourth time the company fail to make a call after telling me that they will. I have lost clients and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars because of this company's negligence. They started off well about 5 years ago but now in the last year they make so many mistakes, and all they do is say oh they won't charge for this call. Will you just lost me potentially thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue and you're going to reimburse me about $10?   As with al...

## Opaque Billing (11 quotes, 6.1%) — "Surprise charges doubled my bill"

**#1** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Overpromised AI capabilities, couldn't deliver; found a competitor with better AI at less than half the price; charged for months of unused service during setup.*

> If I could give this business zero stars, I would.  They made a lot of promises to get us to sign on and then could not do any of what they said they would do.  Found a different company with far better ai capabilities for less than half the price.  Smith also made me pay for multiple months of service that I didn't use - at all - while they were trying to help set up our account.  RUN, don't walk to find another solution for your business.

**#2** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*Billing errors from day one, promised HubSpot/RingCentral integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support; not worth $2,800/month.*

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.  The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse tha...

## Missed Calls (8 quotes, 4.3%) — "He had signed up with a competitor"

**#1** | AnswerConnect | Quality: 5/5 | Trustpilot

*AnswerConnect delayed delivering a customer message so long that the customer signed up with a competitor before they could call back.*

> Just got an email of a message to call a customer from 05/23/16.  We called him as soon as we got it and he had signed up with a competitor.  That can not happen.

**#2** | PATLive | Quality: 4/5 | Trustpilot

*Long hold times before live answer causing callers to hang up; receptionists can't understand callers; wrong company name used.*

> Phone calls are put on music hold for a while before anyone live answers, a lot of callers hang up during this time and we get charged for it. Oftentimes the receptionist can’t understand the caller and the caller gets frustrated having to repeat themselves. The receptionists keep calling us by the wrong name.

## Too Expensive (4 quotes, 4.0%) — "It just got too expensive"

**#1** | Smith.ai | Quality: 5/5 | Reddit

*Dropped Smith.ai after two years because they became more expensive and charge per call; switched to AnswerConnect which charges per minute and is much cheaper*

> Used smith.ai for about two years. They were great, but became more expensive. Plus they charge you per call, which I'm not a fan of. So I switched to answerconnect. Much cheaper since they charge per minute. YMMV since I only use the answering service to get extremely basic information from the client and the calls just don't take very long.

**#2** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 3/5 | Reddit

*Tried Ruby virtual receptionist, thought they were really good, but cancelled because call volume was too low when starting out to justify the cost*

> I tried out Call Ruby (a US-based virtual receptionist service).  They were really good, but I cancelled -- let's be real, no one was calling me at the outset.  lol

## Routing Errors (5 quotes, 2.5%) — "Calls were going all over the place"

**#1** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 4/5 | Trustpilot

*Sales promised compatibility with Google Voice but calls went to wrong places; technology integration failed; switched to competitor Conversational.*

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.  They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their respo...

**#2** | AnswerConnect | Quality: 3/5 | Trustpilot

*AnswerConnect agents don't check the current on-call schedule and dispatch calls to the wrong technician, causing missed calls and business harm.*

> We have had good results/comments from our customers since starting to use the service. The only issues we have had was with call center rep not looking at the current on call tech schedule and calling the wrong tech to dispatch for service.
