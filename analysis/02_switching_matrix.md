# Where Do Customers Go When They Leave?

We found 30 stories where a customer named both the service they left and the service they switched to. It's not a huge sample, but the pattern is clear.

**Ruby Receptionist is the biggest loser.** Net flow of -4. Seven customers described leaving Ruby; only three described arriving. The arrivals are mostly from even worse services — customers who tried cheaper options and traded up. The departures are customers fed up with quality decay.

**PATLive is the biggest winner.** Net flow of +5. Five customers described switching TO PATLive. Zero described leaving. Common thread: "I tried [other service] and was completely unsatisfied. PATLive has been so easy to work with." PATLive wins by default — customers don't love it, they just hate the alternatives less.

**Dialzara is quietly gaining.** Two arrivals, zero departures. Both from customers who tried multiple services. One real estate investor said he "tried multiple AI receptionist services that all failed" before finding Dialzara. Now saving $1,000/month.

The full flow:

| Company | In | Out | Net |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| PATLive | 5 | 0 | **+5** |
| Abby Connect | 3 | 0 | +3 |
| Dialzara | 2 | 0 | +2 |
| Ruby Receptionist | 3 | 7 | **-4** |
| Smith.ai | 2 | 4 | -2 |
| AnswerConnect | 0 | 2 | -2 |
| Synthflow | 0 | 2 | -2 |

**Why do people switch?** We tagged each story with a trigger:

- **Quality** (67%): The calls were handled badly. Wrong info, missed calls, agents who can't follow a script.
- **Capability** (17%): Missing features. No integrations. Limited technology.
- **Pricing** (17%): Too expensive or hidden fees pushed them over the edge.

Quality is overwhelmingly the reason. Not price. Not features. The calls just weren't handled right.

*Caveat: 30 stories is directional, not definitive. But the Ruby signal is consistent with everything else in the data — quality decay, highest complaint volume, longest-tenured customers finally giving up.*
