    "text": "Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.\n\nI was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).\n\n1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same \u201creceptionist\u201d answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn\u2019t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;\n\n2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal\u2026\u2026\u2026and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I\u2019d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; ",

    "text": "A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: \n\nFirst, get a \"virtual office\" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. \n\nSecond, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. \n\nThird, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. \n\nFinally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.",

    "text": "Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.\n\n1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well\n\n2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done\n\n3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.\n\n4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  \n\n5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer",

I don\u2019t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren\u2019t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. \n\nJust a heads up: I don\u2019t expect that your PI practice will be \u201ca bit of a side project\u201d. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims\u2026 there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.",

    "text": "I\u2019ve been using Smith AI for the last four months. I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn\u2019t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don\u2019t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.",

    "text": "We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.\n\nWe started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.\n\nWhat surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.\n\nSince making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.\n\nSince then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole sui",

Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn\u2019t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors. Thank you again Ruby for the winner mentality, look forward to taking your good service to great and even better!",

We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she\u2019d be there until everything was running smoothly.\n\nI had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, \"We can't do that for your company.\" I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.\n\nNow, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they\u2019ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me\u2014PATLive won me over from Day One!",

Amy Hearn was our on-boarding specialist and was wonderful through the whole set-up process & trial period. She explained everything we needed to know and was quick to answer any questions we had. When testing the call service operators each experience was positive and professional. Now we are past the on-boarding period and rely on daily message logs and their normal Customer Service Team which have also proven to be just as responsive.

It's silly but that's just how it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying in",

We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately.

Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two \"back office\" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.\n\nFast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two \"back office\" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  \n\nFast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.\n\nFinally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my \"main line\" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  \n\nThe thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.",

We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)\n\nEach of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. \n\nThen it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is.

She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. \n\nBad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.\n\nWe would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.",

Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.\r\n\r\nInexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed.

But if your callers ask even simple questions\u2014like \u201cDo you have a website?\u201d\u2014it\u2019s too much for them.

Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner.

    "text": "It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  \n\nI have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  \n\nYesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying \"put them into voicemail\".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.\n\nThe app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  \n\nRuby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.",

And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call.

I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers.

They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!\n\nI've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.\n\nSo far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month.

    "text": "I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.\n\nFrom what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.\n\nAny sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.\n\nAnother hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.\n\nAI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.",

The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful.

If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. \n\nIf your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.",

Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. \n\nSince your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.",

I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:\n\n1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my \"finalist\" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer \"office\" over \"firm\".\n\n2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my \"finalist\" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, \"first.lastinjurylawoffice.com\" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. \n\n3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. \n\n4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. \"Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert.\" If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experie",

Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.\n2. Make sure there\u2019s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.\n3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. \n4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.\n5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc \n6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority \n7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some clients going and you want more or you\u2019ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there\u2019s advanced marketing strategies I\u2019d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. \n\nI\u2019m excited for you. I hope it goes well! \n\nIf you\u2019re got more questions feel free to ask.",

It seems the rules of this sub say that I can\u2019t recommend products or services so I guess that\u2019s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There\u2019s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with.

That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.\n\nFrom what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.\n\nA few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.\n\nOne thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.\n\nThe intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.\n\nGood luck with the new practice!",

I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.)

Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!\n\nJust read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.",

The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.\n\nUltimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month.

    "text": "Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerCon",

Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the \"phone tree\" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running.

    "text": "For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.\n\nRuby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.\n\nFirst, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  \n\nI would also like to note tha",

As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.\n\nRuby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.\n\nEven then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. \n\nThe very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering.

    "text": "Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the ca",

    "text": "Unethical company keeps fraudulently charging my credit card after I have requested to cancel multiple times. They refunded the last charge and then I got billed again today. My rep is Katherine Currah and she seems to think that she has the right to not cancel my account just because the thinks she is entitled to try to talk me into staying with the company before she cancels my account. I logged into my account today and my account is still active after canceling two months ago and after having the last charge refunded and telling them to cancel my account multiple times. This is the law straw. I am filing complaints with the BBB, Trust Pilot and the FTC. I am also filing a police reporting, reporting the fraud to the attorney general as well as filing a formal complaint on Katherine Curran with the company. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING WITH THIS UNETHICAL, CRIMINAL COMPANY THAT FRAUDULENTLY CHARGES YOUR CREDIT CARD.",

They don\u2019t tell you that up front.\n\nI started small, thinking I\u2019d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you\u2019re on enterprise. Unless you\u2019re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.\n\nTheir \u201ctech support\u201d takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it\u2019s not with a solution, but with another question\u2014like they didn\u2019t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.\n\nThey kept charging me, claiming I didn\u2019t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.\n\nNo phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don\u2019t waste your time or money here.\n\nSynthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they\u2019ll vanish.\n\n---",

    "text": "I was using their Enterprise package for a few months. With Enterprise plan I had 20000 minutes monthly, but because their batch calling didn't work I couldn't use any of it. They keep posting new updates, but their basic functions don't work. For example, if you upload a list of contacts and first and last name ends in a name row. In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages. Avoid them, save your time, money and nerves. There is so many better software's out there. Extremely dissapointed!",

Bot fails to make calls with no explanation, webhooks dont always fire causing issues with tagging and workflows inside CRM.

I think I'll be filing a chargeback and hiring someone to setup Vapi for us. SynthFlow seemed too good to be true and I guess that is an accurate assumption. Smh \ud83d\ude14",

API doesnt work, bot hallucinating, I spent 25K a programmer to build something around Synthflow. on top of the $450/month. I book 3 calendar meeting with Alex and Albert. Both don't show up to 3 different ocasions whilst. Sent 8 emails to everyone just to give me an estimate date for fixes or to at least reply what they are going to do. No replies to this date. Not even the decency to reply to me saying this is the date for fix or any sort of response. Just plain ignored.\n\nAsked for a refund no reply to this date. \n\nGuys do yourself a favor and find another company...this is run as a joke it seems. Not even answering a client on your top tier plan is just ridiculous.\n\nRun away if you still can\n\nMy clients are dropping on the otherhand and I spent thousands on google and facebook ads...probably lost 40k because of SF. I am looking into legal routes at the moment. Will also contact their investors and tell my story.",
