> I once got annoyed with a salesman from Yelp.  He would me all the time.  When I would tell him no, he would double down and be hostile.  I asked him "how would you like it if a saleperson called you, out of the blue, and insisted you to buy something?"  He said it would not bother him.

When I bought my car, I actually had it shipped across country.  I placed my info in "instant quote" web page and was amazed at the number of calls I got from salespeople trying to quote me a price to ship my car over.

Soooooo....I hung up my call with my yelp guy....put all of his info in the quote web page, told them that I wanted to transport two cars from Florida to Wahshington within two weeks.....I can only assume the yelp salesman's phone was lit up for a week....I never heard back from him. 

To OP, the problem is that half the time, you guys lie to get around the receptionist and then we are on deadlines, and you are cold calling us. It is infuriating.

> There's nothing obnoxious about hiring a personal assistant. What's obnoxious is hiring a legal assistant, receptionist, or other law firm staff and then expecting that person to do personal tasks like picking up dry cleaning.

It's a common problem in very small firms - especially if there's two partners and they're married to each other! - for the owner/partners to fail to maintain enough separation between their personal and professional lives.  It causes drama and dissatisfaction.  Don't ask your legal secretary to do personal errands; the secretary will resent doing them and your partner will resent paying for them.  If personal services are what you need the most help with, hire a personal assistant, on your own dime not the firm's; be clear about your expectations, treat the assistant with respect and pay them well.  

Also don't ask either a legal assistant or a personal assistant to clean the office.  Get a janitor for that.

> Actually just worked on a project where we tried to Define and write down the specific job duties for legal secretaries and paralegals.    

Some of this is going to be very specific to the environment.  For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. 

What we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training 

Attorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. 

Second, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. 


A really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. 

However getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done. At the beginning it will definitely take longer because you are having to teach someone how to do it rather than simply do it yourself. 

With that said a good paralegal should be able to
- keep files in order and ensure new items are filed correctly. 
- keep up with notes and summaries enabling an attorney to catch up on a file quickly 
- draft simple documents like cover letters and rote pleadings from forms for your approval.  (You dont need to be a lawyer to write "the defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 7" over and over again). 
- calendar deadlines
- work on service of process 


If you are the manager. Think about 5 tasks that you feel like waste your time and keep you from doing productive work.  Write down step by step directions for those tasks and then talk to a paralegal. 

If you are a junior person in a larger entity, talk to partners/managers about what the paralegals do.  They might already ve occupied or feel that they give partners tasks priority.

> I normally write off negative reviews like yours because everyone's had some disgruntled clients who totally misinterpret the situation and are impossible to please. I mean, I have all 5 stars on my reviews so far but I mean, I'm good at my job :P 

With that said, I do love talking shit about bad attorneys so you know my gossipy ass was out googling the firm anyway. If this is the one in Vegas, I actually think you might be on to something. 

I mean, 195 solid 5 star reviews of Casey Xavier as an *attorney* generally, but from my review they don't read like actual client reviews and there are no case details, extremely generic. They read more like 'friends' or colleagues. Generic praise for the attorney and/or experience 'working with them' which can be anything. And zero reviews on yelp at the same time. And like 182 of those reviews are all from the last two months. Prior to that explosion of glowing reviews, he had a couple 1 stars. **Definitely seems like he bought the reviews.** 

>The disconnect between management and employees is so fake it's almost comical, and don't even get me started on job security – or lack thereof. Do your best and still get shown the door like yesterday's trash? Check.

This is common at those mills though, they treat people like your case. High volume, low care. It's unfortunate but a lot of the attorneys are probably working for a temp service, answering service, or are just highly underpaid. PI is one of those fields of law where a lot of staff can be helpful, whereas my firm has 3 attorneys and no staff (a full-time receptionist is next though, it's too much). Case mills tend to underpay people and churn through staff like crazy and cheap out whenever possible. 

As to the offshoring work, it's actually pretty common for stuff like calling for medical records requests and formulaic, admin HIPAA stuff. I've only seen the bigger case mills do it, and it's not really a great sign that the firm cares about your case specifically IMO, but that sort of work doesn't really need to be highly skilled either.

> Why wouldn’t you do the intake after the receptionist confirms that it is probably a legit case?

The saying goes that you need to do two equally important things to have a successful PI firm: 1) get clients, 2) work their cases. 
I don’t think I’d delegate the first one.

> This is why I say I work remotely at home and only have office hours by appointment only. Sometimes I’m actually working at my office. But no one can just walk in or drop in. It’s an executive suite with a keypad that people need to know the password to get in. No one knows my password except for me and my husband (who sometimes acts like my assistant).   I have had people call and say they’re at my office and they need to drop off paperwork for me to look at etc and they aren’t even clients - I’ve never even heard of them before. I dealt with this problem but hiring a text service that responds to customer inquiries from my website or text with an invitation to schedule a paid consult. I also want to hire some kind of remote or virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but I don’t have this yet. I usually just text them after they leave a voicemail and tell them all potential client inquiries are handled via text. Then when they text me back my text service takes it from there.   I have 4 kids and 7 pets and a lot of hobbies. I take weightlifting classes and teach Zumba classes for my physical and mental health. I also have plenty of clients I’m working for already. I’m not giving up more than two minutes of my time to anyone else for free. It takes me two minutes to text potential clients who call and tell them to text instead. If they don’t want to follow my system and book a paid consult via text then I don’t want to have to talk to them and I certainly don’t want to have to see them at my office in person!

> We have two managing partners, two case managers and two paralegals. We have about 420 PI cases. Roughly 80 are in litigation. We also have a 24/7 receptionist that helps us out. 

If liability doesn’t clear or is questionable we immediately drop the case. No need to hold on or waste our resources. We use to feel bad for clients but at some point you have to drop them rather then fight for “something” rather than nothing.

### 9. r/LawFirm — 2025-06-24 | Quality: ?/5

> I am a paralegal.  What I did today included (but was not limited to) attending a weekly practice group coordination meeting, reviewing an updated closing checklist received from lender counsel and emailing her a document that was done but hadn't been sent to her yet, conferring with an associate about an unusual tax issue in a contract we're working on together and making some revisions to the contract, responding to an email from a client about a minor change he wants to the draft contract I sent him last week, drafting an operating agreement amendment and a couple of authorizing resolutions and sending them to my supervising attorney for review before they go to lender counsel.  Next on my list is drafting an easement agreement, which I'll send to a different supervising attorney for review before it goes to the client. 



I've been doing this work for a long time, but even less experienced paralegals should not be spending a lot of time answering calls, making copies, and scanning.  It sounds like you want a secretary/legal assistant, or possibly just a receptionist or file clerk.  And if you're constantly asking paralegals to do admin support work, it's not terribly surprising that they've just stopped responding to you.  Although based on your description of the general situation in your organization, I have to wonder, who hired these paralegals, what *is* their actual job description, and how are their duties assigned?  It's unlikely that they truly aren't doing *anything*, so what is it that they *are* doing and why is it invisible to you and other lawyers?  Presumably in a nonprofit you don't have the billable/nonbillable distinctions that generally separate paralegals from LAs, and you may very well not have an abundance of staff so the job descriptions of those you do have may need to be hybrid.  But clearly there's a mismatch of expectations.  And you're not going to resolve that without involving whatever the higher management level is in your company - the general counsel, perhaps, or whoever is the administrator of the legal department.

> Locking down potential new clients and keeping existing clients happy is the most important thing for most small firms.  Receptionists are critical because you are typically the first person these people interact with.  You’re the face they see when they walk in the door, and the voice they get when they call on the phone.  Be friendly, welcoming, professional, kind, and have a positive attitude.  Even when the person you are dealing with is the exact opposite.  The rest you can learn.

Personality is far and away the most important trait in my opinion when hiring for a receptionist position.

> Small town firm here. We started in option A and moved up to option B after 3 years of provable income. Option B definitely gives walk-in clients but we also need to watch the door which is truly a huge fucking hassle. If you’re family law you will have all the clients you need and then some. I’d recommend option A until you can afford the higher rent and a receptionist to cover the door.

> Referral services have a reputation for bottom of the barrel cases. Basically, people who have been rejected by every lawyer in town go to these places and then get referred. 

"Uh, I failed the drug test at my job and they fired me. I wasn't even all that wasted! Can I sue?"

No, thanks.

That being said, if you're cold calling, you're in for a bad time. If you try to dupe my receptionist to get to me, you're getting your ass chewed. 

"Yes, I'm calling to refer a case to you all / I need local counsel in your area"  

If you use deception to get to me, it's a nonstarter.

Also, if you require a long term agreement, your product is likely shit.

> Full disclosure, I'm an attorney not a legal assistant but when I was a law clerk at a small firm during law school, I was hired to assist in attorney work, under supervision of course, but I was also tasked with doing anything and everything needed around the office. I would help with very basic clerical tasks, sometimes cover for the assistants/receptionist as needed. If you're at a small firm, it's common to have a all-hands on deck mentality imo.

Is the receptionist out quite often or is this just on an as-needed basis? Also, are the partners understanding that your work for them might be a little slower on days you cover for the receptionist? Or are they being unreasonable?

> Yeah I dunno, that logic just doesn't make sense. No one likes to be picked up only to have the Receptionist tell them to "please hold" and they go to a hold line anyway. Much more practical just to queue the calls regardless. 

Regardless, depending on your phone system, you could create virtual extensions called Line 1,2,3 etc, add them to a queue and make them pickup lines for each user, and set the call queue to be sequential with those "lines." So when a call comes in, it would flash as "line 1" and once answered, stay busy and "line 2" would flash for the next line.

> Take notes on everything. You'll likely only get a week of training, and you'll want to make sure you ask good questions and write down things to refer back to. 

Law firm politics can be tough. Get to know your colleagues but don't share too much personal information. Identify the people who are willing to assist you and the ones who are overworked and stressed and act accordingly. 

Best advice I got when I started out: If an attorney asks you a question you don't know the answer to never say "I don't know.", say "I'm not sure, let me get back to you." and then go figure it out. 

Good luck!!! I started out as a receptionist and worked my way to Senior Paralegal over the years. It's a great foot in the door, make the most of it!

Do you really want to call the lead on Monday only to have them tell you, “sorry, I already hired someone else?”

Generating new business is the most difficult thing we do. It’s also one of the most expensive. If you don’t want to call on the weekends or after hours, hire someone else to do it. I have a 24/7 answering service that will transfer qualified leads to my cell phone.

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

> I would try to increase the commercial side and raise your commercial rates.  The residential stuff is, as you know, highly commoditized and really hard to increase revenue without getting a chunk of the title business. (That said, my real estate practice has always been 100% commercial.) 

If you need to add staff, I would be looking offshore and at potential AI solutions. AI can draft a lot of your closing documents, for instance although you probably have software to do that efficiently. I haven’t yet found it ready for prime time but AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road. I think it’ll be ready soon if it isn’t yet. I would keep your W-2 headcount to a minimum.

> not a brag but i do some PI. have a firm that keeps about 20-25 cases. they’re all catastrophic or at least a crazy story, and they’re usually pretty interesting because of the science or story behind it. some products, some employment, even a few auto cases (you’ll always have at least a few even if it’s friends or friends of friends and you’d otherwise pass on it), some business. basically, if i think i can litigate it and make decent money, i’ll do it. i do get brought into trials too, i guess. otherwise this sounds super easy. these cases are discovery intensive, though.

  
anyway. my point with all of this is that there *is* interesting plaintiffs’ work out there if that’s your thing. you just aren’t being exposed to it. i’d pick up all the skills you can in the time you remain at your current job and start polishing off your resume while you look for a boutique type place. you still need at least some of the skills you’re learning now, even if it’s organization, filing, calendaring. 

equally important is to see what these people are doing wrong, and avoid it. do they take too many of certain cases? if their goal is prelit settlement but they find the left turn cases never settle, they should immediately refer them to someone who will file them, right? do they borrow too much? at bad rates? are their computers too old/expensive? do they pay too much for software they never use? is the receptionist fucking stoned and missing calls?

good luck. there are a lot of areas of practice even in P law. what you’re doing now barely requires a law license. it’ll get better when you bounce.

> I'm an associate in a small firm (7 attorneys) that deals exclusively with family law. The four "senior" attorneys each have their own paralegals, whom they each pay individually, while us three junior attorneys do not have any support staff. Our receptionist completes basic tasks for everyone in the firm, like taking phone messages and putting postage on envelopes, but other than that we're each on our own. 

I actually pay one of the senior attorney's paralegals on the side (with permission) to draft stuff for me as needed. I'm in an awkward position where I'm not bringing in enough to hire my own full-time assistant yet, but I'm getting more work than what I can manage on my own. This arrangement works for now. But do I wish that our firm had legal assistants that were available to everyone? Yes. 

I'd like to hear from others how common this arrangement is, though. My friend is an associate at a medium-sized firm and thinks it's outrageous that I pay out of pocket for an assistant. He says that's something the firm ought to cover for associates, like Lexis and Clio (both of which I also pay out of pocket for). Everyone at my firm acts like it's totally normal, though, so I really don't know if this is the "done" thing?

My paralegal is super tech-savvy—she’s always using tools I don’t even know the names of. For demand generation, it’s mostly just me using ChatGPT to get a solid draft going We’ve got a full-time receptionist, but during after-hours or when she’s already on a call, I use Lawtte to handle overflow. I would probably say the real key is hiring someone who is tech savvy.

> We have used Ruby as a reception service since we opened 14 years ago. It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately. (We also only conduct busines calls and emails during work hours except if it's a emergency.)

> That’s crazy. I started my own firm with no capital but I didn’t do ads or get into debt. I did freelance contract-based/overflow work for other attorneys. And I let every attorney I knew know that I was going solo and what areas I practiced in. I also did hourly or flat fee payment work that I otherwise wasn’t interested in but those kinds of cases (family law, bankruptcy, property dispute type stuff) helped me pay my living expenses while I waited for my contingency fee cases to settle. I kept my expenses very low and did everything myself until I had saved up capital to hire a receptionist and assistant. 

I’m just commenting so that people know there are ways to do this without going into credit card debt or paying that much to Google. I’m glad your way is working out though as there are many different ways. Good luck with continuing to grow your firm!

Also, I don't fault the PI guy for explaining why he's not taking a case. A lot of people just want to be heard. If you go through that with them, they can be your best referral sources. My best source of cases are people whose cases I declined, for much the same reason--they trust me--I wouldn't take their money for a bad case.

> We are only allowed to wear few colors (dark colors). I have to wear heels every day M-Th (my feet are in so much pain even though I haven't walked around much). We MUST bring a blazer everyday even though it is 100 degrees out and rarely cold here. (Important to note, the guy attorneys have dressed in blue jeans and t-shirts 🙃 There are no female attorneys on staff).

Yeah this is super sexist. The men wear tshirts and the women have to wear blazers and heels? Wtf?? Very unsurprising that there's no female lawyers at this firm, your firm prob wouldn't hire them, only hires women to be support staff, and potentially wouldn't hire them as staff unless they're young and conventionally attractive. A lot of male bosses like hiring women to be staff but not lawyers cuz they feel female staff are less likely to ask for raises and more likely to be Your firm is sexist AF and could potentially get in trouble for gender discrimination.

> Most of the support staff is young girls in our 20s (myself included). Most of us have only started working there in the past two years, majority within this year. I have heard rumors of a mass quitting of Case Managers but don’t know anything beyond that.

Aaaaand I was right. Definitely a super sexist firm. The whole reason the other staff haven't been there that long is cuz everyone else quit. 

> very few coworkers really had any positive reviews of their experience.

How unsurprising lol.

> the one time I briefly used my phone to decline my father's call and texted him that I was busy (took like 30s if I am being generous) I received a "gentle" reminder from the HR rep training me to stop using my phone. Again, I was on it for barely a couple seconds to decline a phone call. Another one of the receptionists up front was told to never wear her Apple Watch to work.

Your bosses are fucking crazy. That's not normal at all. Don't be goofing off at your desk, but you did nothing wrong. If you can't even wear an apple watch to work that's crazy. It's like your firm has a really obvious pattern of controlling what their female employees wear...oh wait

> There are cameras everywhere. Most of the supervisors (HR, head attorneys) have a bunch of tv screens in their office overlooking the rest of the staff's desks like a mall security guard.

The rampant sexism was already egregious, but this is the creepiest part. Security cameras are one thing, but those should be pointing towards doors and windows- not your employees. Many states have laws specifically banning this kind of stuff. How big is this firm? The smaller it is, the creepier it is. Even if it's big this is still insane. Orwell & Orwell is clearly a nightmare to work for. These psychos def spend a lot of time using their cameras to perv on their female staff. Make sure there's no cameras in the bathrooms, a place this vile would totally do something like that. Guarantee your bosses spend

> Hire Ruby Receptionist to answer your forwarded line to Ruby. It's well worth the expense. Have Ruby collect pertinent caller info (caller name, case, matter, etc) have her forward your law related calls to you with brief caller intro from Ruby to you (where you either take the call or have her take a message or send to vm; call info then goes to you via text, email or app) & have Ruby thank all sales solicitors for their call, but you are not interested in their service or product & to please take you off you their calling / contact list immediately. Ruby is very good at dealing with sales calls if you instruct them to never put them through. We also have Ruby immediately put through anyone from the Court or their office, our bank that might be calling with a trust account issue, & other VIP callers.

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone. 

If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

1. A good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate my intake into CRM. 

2. 	Workflow automation – making documents and tasks move without manual chasing.

3.	Client follow-through – getting clients to sign, fund, or comply.

> Do you think you were the victim of a bait and switch regarding the job you thought you were applying to? Or, once you were in the interview, did they determine that you don't have the skills they need for a legal assistant so they then pivoted to discussing a mailroom position? The distinction makes a big difference. If you applied to a job posted as "legal assistant" but they started off right away discussing a mailroom job, that's not a good sign and I probably wouldn't proceed with them. 

If it's the latter and they said something like, "I don't think your skills and experience match with our needs for a legal assistant at this point, but we're willing to move forward with a mailroom position," then that means they see something in you even though you might not be a fit for the original position. That would be a different story and I might consider moving forward.

Law firms can be great places to work and grow, and in my experience they often prefer promoting from within (it's easier to hire a new mailroom assistant or receptionist than an experienced legal assistant or paralegal). I've seen this happen many times. So it's completely reasonable that this could happen to you if you get the job. But remember job interviews are a two-way street. Dig into that a little more if you get a second interview and ask them how often they do promote from within, and make it clear to them that this is important to you. If they seem honest and sincere and you feel comfortable with the folks you've met and the answers to your questions, you might want to consider moving forward.

Receptionist: Fire yourself;  
Intake Coordinator: Fire yourself;  
Paralegal/Case Manager: Fire yourself;  
Grunt that does Legal Work: Promote yourself to a supervisor role

  
After you fire yourself and bring in BETTER PEOPLE to handle those roles you'll notice that you are able to focus on higher-level functions of your business. You can network better and actually spend time moving cases to their completion and making more money.

We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren’t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can’t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.  Now if the firm isn’t returning your call, that is on them.

> Is it court appearances the reason you want an associate?  I ask because I worked for a solo for over 20 years.  After about 5 years, the firm had grown, and I started taking over some of the lighter firm administrative duties, in addition to my lead litigation role.  We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.  My solo did securities litigation and arbitration (me), some personal injury, and elder law.  All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.

My boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.

This allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.

By the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.  We had such a great group of staff working there, so staff issues were minimal.

He also purchased a business condo, which turned out to be a wonderful firm investment. One securities case award was enough to pay it off and then served as an open line of credit if it was needed between awards/settlements.

He still calls me on occasion for advice.  He has his eye on winding down his practice, refers complex litigation to younger attorneys in other firms, and has built a great elder law practice, which keeps him quite comfortable.   He still has the same elder law paralegal.

I also added a social space with comfy couches and a little bar for socializing.

In addition to the privacy, natural light, and sound damping that folks have already mentioned (which are spot on), we have a good number of litigators, so we added a small moot court room that doubles as an electronic hearing room (the size of a small office). We have more virtual hearings than in-person these days, so this room is at the end of the hall where it’s quiet, has all the videoconferencing equipment set up properly and ready to go, and no distractions in the background.

Also, a private area for nursing women to pump.

> Here are my suggestions with some reasons.

Use WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.

Get at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.

For bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.

Consider having an answering service to present a "bigger" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.

For hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:

Printer with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.

Sheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.

Get a flatbed scanner if you need it.

Get fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.

Get a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.

Get a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.

Software oriented tools:

Please read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)

Notice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the à la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.

Of course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.

You need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with

Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. 

Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.

We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls:
Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message.
Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.

I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.

Inexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.

I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

**"Functioning but not always accurate in a few ways."**

> Our service works, most of the time. Many times it probably works perfectly when we're not noticing it. However when it doesn't it comes to light in a big way. Callers expect people to know how to pronounce the business name and to be transferred to the right person 100% of the time. While no one is perfect that's the goal. The service is good and functioning but we don't get much satisfaction from our clients who are put through the service. It seems seem less as you review it. Not sure 100% why, it could be simply the process but that's our experience.

I think the biggest problem is not having a group of reps specifically on your account that have a little bit of understanding on what to do or how to handle callers specifically for your business. I have gone back and forth to improve the call center's response and information gathering but it's very frustrating to have to continually monitor and do that.

**"Sales team great, answering execution terrible"**

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.

If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.

Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

> They have a couple of really good receptionists. They can be great if you work with one or two consistently regarding your account. But having so many receptionists, with our firm having a list of specific call handling instructions, we get a lot of errors. We gets calls forwarded to the office when a message should have been taken, and we receive messages when the call should have been forwarded. The business is a great concept, but I don't recommend it unless you just need a receptionist to answer your calls and either forward ALL of them or take a message for ALL of them. They should assign a specific number of receptionists per client or have fewer employees.

**"Screening my calls EPIC FAILURE"**

> My recent engagements with Ruby Customer Service weren't what I expected. I was pretty much challenged by the representative regarding instructions I gave to the receptionist regarding someone calling inbound for the 'wrong company.' The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them. So sad that this situation could have ended differently if only the receptionist valued my words more than the callers.

This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  

I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  

Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.

The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  

Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

The bill from AT&T was in error, and the old call center had unknowingly been eating the charge for 2 years. Once we figured that out, the process was fairly easy.

Short answer: Find out who the resporg is. That entity and your new carrier need to work together to complete the port.

But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!

I've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.

So far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.

> We use [Smith ai](https://smithai.referralrock.com/l/MICHAEL61) and are very happy with them. Flexible, affordable, and the human receptionists are professional sounding (don't let the reference to "AI" confuse you). As you grow, you may appreciate the data and analytics their dashboard and integrations offer. I started using them as a solo and will keep using them as we expand to a staff of 10-12.

> I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.

From what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.

Any sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.

Another hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.

If anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.

AI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.

> Since all your numbers have been ported to the new carrier, and you're most likely in a 2 or 3 year contract as well with the new carrier, you're going to have to buckle down and make this work; unless you're willing to pay the penalty fee to break the contract.  And I hate to say this, but since you were the one pushing for this change, I'm sure upper management is looking for you to fix it as well.  I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.

- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.

- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into production.

- Now that you have the phone make/model that you want to use, you will need to get the SIP registration information from your carrier and configure each phone with those settings.  You will need to get this information from tech support (unless they have some FAQ online that has this information).  Typically, if you had ordered the phones through your carrier, the phones would have been pre-configured and registered to your cloud PBX.  It would have been plug and play as the installation tech communicated to you.  Since you told your sales rep that you wanted to use your own phones, you will need to configure your phones with the correct SIP registration settings.  Those SIP settings would be the username, password, SIP Server address, SIP registration port, backup SIP server if applicable, proxy server and port if applicable.  Most VoIP carriers will push their own configs to the phones once it has successfully registered with the PBX, but the important thing is to get your phones provisioned and registered to the cloud PBX.

- In the admin portal you will need to create your users, build your extensions, assign your users to the devices/phones, create your ring group(s), create your auto attendant, and route calls to your phone numbers accordingly.  Your carrier should have "how to" guides on how to accomplish this.

- Since you are up shits creek with no service because you don't have any phones working, you should check with tech support to see if there is a sof

> Late 40s.  I don't leave voicemails related to work stuff, except when I am calling a court and it is their practice that you leave a VM and someone will call you back.  

We don't even have VM set up on our work number.  I work at a small completely virtual firm with no office and no receptionist.  Work calls go through this automated thing and just get forwarded to our mobiles.  That's happened to me 2x in >5 years lol. If anyone is calling me out go the blue they call my mobile, it is either a colleague or expert I am working with, or an OPC that I have a good enough relationship with to give me cell phone number to.  Latter typically only happens during trial/for urgent things, and even then they usually just text first.  Clients usually just email unless we are traveling together, and then mobile.  I can't even recall the last time I got a work related VM.

All the ones we demo have not been good enough for prime time, but they can serve a purpose for overflow/nights/weekends. Meaning they are still better than voicemail. 

I’ve never demoed the one mentioned in this thread. I thought the tech wasn’t quite there yet, but maybe it is just the deployment of said tech.

So it was always - “this pay is for work for the firm, and this is for pay from me personally.” We ended up moving to a fully hybrid personal assistant/legal assistant-receptionist deal because then I could pay her everything as a W-2. But the expectations have to be EXTREMELY clear.

It may not be the job for her but unfortunately this is apart of her job responsibilities. I had a paralegal like that and I should’ve stopped it much sooner than I did. There needs to be enough money to hire a receptionist. It’s possible that there is and isn’t. It’s something to explore but it’s either there’s money for it or you let the current paralegal go and hire someone that’s a better fit.

> You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. 

Since your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.

> I left the public defenders office to join a family law firm and started a criminal defense practice for that family law firm. I later left that firm and joined a larger firm and continued to do criminal defense and family law. I made most of my money from family law, but enjoyed the criminal law practice 1000% more. For years I tried to ditch family law and do more criminal defense work. I was not successful. Partly because I kept taking on big complex family law cases, but partly because I was known as a family law lawyer and that's what people referred my way. 

  
Family law burned me out. I was only able to fully quit it by moving to another jurisdiction and joining a firm doing completely different work. 

  
My family law clients were very needy. They require a lot of staff support. My criminal defense clients were usually not very needy and I barely needed staff to handle them. (Don't get me wrong staff was important, but it was possible to handle my criminal law files without staff if necessary. Family law without staff may be possible for stronger lawyers than I, but I don't recommend it.) 

  
From a financial standpoint, your plan makes sense. From a mental health stand point, I strongly recommend against it. If you expand to family law, you will need a good receptionist and a good paralegal. Someone that can calm the clients down when you aren't available, and someone to work up the files for you while you are in court.  

  
I found that learning family law was not that difficult. That was true in my jurisdiction partly because the judges largely ignored the rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, caselaw, etc. Family law was where the rules meant nothing. The "trials" were not enjoyable like criminal trials. No jury. Usually just the other side, maybe a couple of other small witnesses. Your trial advocacy skills won't get used much. 

  
The hardest part to learn, beyond dealing with the clients, was calculating child support and alimony/maintenance/spousal support. That and learning how to read a tax return. Befriend a CPA and pay them to help you understand a tax return if that isn't something you are familiar with. 

  
But ultimately, don't do it. If you can make a decent living doing criminal defense, you'll be a lot happier.

> Well don’t just spend money to lower tax liability. But if you need something and will buy it soon, might as well offset this year’s tax liability. I would say keep overhead low as long as possible (said as a solo grown to 6 over the last year). Think about hiring first for the lowest level stuff you need help with. Maybe receptionist or exec assistant. Then paralegal. Locking into a traditional office lease now might not be the best idea. They are usually a few years long and you don’t quite know where you’ll be. I have a dedicated office in a we work type building. 4 conference rooms to rent by the hour. If I needed to get a second or third office for additional employees, easy peasy.

> I started out over 40 years ago as a receptionist in a law firm.  The commpleted and closed files sat in my area.  Out of boredom, I started going through files to see how they progress, from the atty's original notes to pleadings to discovery and the judgment.  I began to understand how things progress, and I stayed in that career over 40 years.  It's a great career.  Ask your coworkers for help when you need it.  Return every call from every client.  Even if the atty you work with is an ass at times, understand their whole career and license is on the line.  Show an interest in learning!

### 115. r/LawFirm — 2025-07-07 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

> Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.

From what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.

A few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.

One thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.

Also, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.

The intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.

Good luck with the new practice!

Since I can decide who I sell to I prefer smaller companies since often the boss will still pick up the phone himself. But if I get a Gatekeeper I just say my name and the CEOs name expecting to be put thru and it usually works. If the receptionist asks what its about I just say "I have another question". I just keep it super short, if they keep hassling me I just tell them I have a call coming in, say thanks and hang up and dial the next. I never spend time with them or get friendly with them. But thats mainly because for me its a numbers games and I dont just want to sell to very few, specific people.
