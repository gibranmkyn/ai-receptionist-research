> A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: 

First, get a "virtual office" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. 

Second, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. 

Third, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. 

Finally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.

> This is what I would recommend: Clio Manage & Grow, Quickbooks, Microsoft 365 (don't need co-pilot. it's expensive and I rarely use it), Zoom pro, RingCentral instead of Google Voice, JusticeText (for video management), one legal research service.

  
You don't need Calendly (Clio Grow has most of that functionality). You don't need ClickUp (Clio Manage has a better task management).

  
Consider getting a virtual receptionist service within 3 months, but you don't need it immediately.

> So you have a receptionist, intake, sales person, and attorneys?  Might be overkill for our office.  Think maybe receptionist answer calls to see if PC > paralegal to sell or schedule consults > attorney to do the work or meet for consults.
