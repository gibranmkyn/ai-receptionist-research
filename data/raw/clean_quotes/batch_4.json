I have gone back and forth to improve the call center's response and information gathering but it's very frustrating to have to continually monitor and do that.",

Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.\n\nIf all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions\u2014like \u201cDo you have a website?\u201d\u2014it\u2019s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn\u2019t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.\n\nTheir sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn\u2019t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can\u2019t say your name right, what does that say about your business?",

The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call.

I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers.

They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!\n\nI've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.\n\nSo far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month.

Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.\n\nAny sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.\n\nAnother hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.\n\nAI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.",

I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.\n\n- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.\n\n- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into prod",

I don't leave voicemails related to work stuff, except when I am calling a court and it is their practice that you leave a VM and someone will call you back.  \n\nWe don't even have VM set up on our work number.  I work at a small completely virtual firm with no office and no receptionist.  Work calls go through this automated thing and just get forwarded to our mobiles.  That's happened to me 2x in >5 years lol. If anyone is calling me out go the blue they call my mobile, it is either a colleague or expert I am working with, or an OPC that I have a good enough relationship with to give me cell phone number to.  Latter typically only happens during trial/for urgent things, and even then they usually just text first.  Clients usually just email unless we are traveling together, and then mobile.  I can't even recall the last time I got a work related VM.",

You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick.

The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for \"the benefit of the firm's KPIs.\"\n\nIt needs to be simple:\n\n- Incoming call\n- Answer\n- Name\n- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. \n- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. \n- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. \n\nThe firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. \n\nIf your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.",

I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn\u2019t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.\n\n6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person.

    "text": "You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. \n\nSince your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.",

High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.\n\nSome of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:\n\n* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.\n* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.\n* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level.

For example, a receptionist or bookkeeper, CFO, etc. \n\nThat gives you your rough ceiling. If the founder only spends half their time on billable work, you account for that (15 hrs a week). \n\nSo 6 hours a day for production people is \u201cat capacity\u201d 4.85 is low. \n\nAnother issue is timekeeping.

I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:\n\n1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my \"finalist\" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer \"office\" over \"firm\".\n\n2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my \"finalist\" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, \"first.lastinjurylawoffice.com\" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. \n\n3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. \n\n4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. \"Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert.\" If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experie",

Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.\n2. Make sure there\u2019s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.\n3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. \n4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.\n5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc \n6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority \n7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some clients going and you want more or you\u2019ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there\u2019s advanced marketing strategies I\u2019d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. \n\nI\u2019m excited for you. I hope it goes well! \n\nIf you\u2019re got more questions feel free to ask.",

It seems the rules of this sub say that I can\u2019t recommend products or services so I guess that\u2019s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There\u2019s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with.

    "text": "Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.\n\nFrom what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.\n\nA few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.\n\nOne thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.\n\nThe intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.\n\nGood luck with the new practice!",

Rarely will a couple days be enough time for me to realistically evaluate what you're selling, so be prepared to adjust the trial period. Likewise, don't tell me that the price is only available if I commit right away -- if you're selling me something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars over a lifetime, I need to take my time, and as a solo, I don't have time to spend hours at a time making a decision right away.  A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.  Needless to say, I declined to consider them after that.",

But cold selling is tough.\n\nI was going to say they have the brand name, but then you said they were startups.\n\nDid you go to 4 demos of startups? Kind of lost me there.\n\nAnyways, there are a couple ways i\u2019ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.\n\n1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day\u2014absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.\n\n2. GHL dudes cold-calling\u2014These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They\u2019re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. \n\n3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. \n\nLastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. \n\nAlso, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.",
