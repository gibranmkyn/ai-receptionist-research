> Start small my friend. I would recommend starting with a virtual receptionist service to field your calls. It's month to month, and around $250.

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

> You need at least one firm manager to handle crap like payroll, accounting, etc. 

One paralegal to do the actual work (bitching out clinics because their records suck, their bills suck, their treatment sucks)

Probably a secretary / receptionist to field calls and vet new clients and to inform clients that their case hasn't settled yet, it's one been an hour since the accident, and no, just because your mother's sister's best friend got $100 million for a stubbed toe does not mean your case is worth the same.

Maybe one associate to handle demands, negotiate, draft pleadings.

> For reference, Im a biglaw corporate and tax (M&A) in the DC area launching a solo firm in one week. I’m taking a few PE clients with me but downshifting to small business work. My start up costs so far (still figuring some things out) in round numbers are:

Entity registration: 250
Malpractice insurance: 1500 annually 
Web/branding/photos: 5000 one time - no maintenance or SEO needed 
45k working capital LOC: 600 lender fees
Openphone: 275 annually
Adobe: 15/mo
Clio: 35/mo
Office 365: 7/mo
Quick books: 17/mo intro rate 
Remote receptionist: 15/mo
Square space: 15/mo

I splurged on the website bc I’m using a client. You can do your own for like 50/100 bucks and get a logo on fiverr or something.

I plan to buy a Lenovo laptop or something g similar from Costco for $500 or so in the near future. 

I’m working from home and using conference space at my accountant’s office if ever needed. Most of my meetings and closings are remote. 

I’m probably missing something but that’s a good start. I have about 30k in cash set aside to draw on until I generate steady revenue.

> Technically no, but there are so many ways case management software processes help you for the future. 

1. CYA: I document everything - every call, every action, everything in the case management software. When I need a certificate of conference on a motion to compel I can filter the notes in the file and pull any tagged "Defense counsel" and grab the dates to list how many times I conferred with defense on the issue. I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. 

2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. 

3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from "service" to "litigation" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. 

4. Expansion: You're a new solo, but if you want to bring on staff or other attorneys in the future, having a CMS prevents things like accidentally deleting a line in the excel sheet, usually gives essentially version control to most stuff in the file, and allows you to set standard processes that let you train staff, make sure they're doing their work, assign tasks and grow responsibly. But in order to do that, it's so much easier to set up the processes before you have them and it's just you. build a foundation with an eye towards expansion so you're not trying to create processes and adjust to the new CMS when you've got two paralegals and a receptionist.

> Look, I get it, I fought hard to be almost fully remote, but you are way off base in some practice areas.

>Calls can be forwarded to their home office

Yeah, but they can't forward calls to other extensions at the firm, and calls from other extensions can't be forwarded to them. This is a primary function for some support staff.

>mail can be picked up

I said deliveries. There are deliveries from clients and counsel all the time, some of which need to be signed for. Clients also drop things off periodically, and they will take a firm more seriously if they have someone at the desk full time. Fair or not.

>USPS offers informed delivery, so you know when a package arrives

So what, is the remote admin going to drive to the office to safeguard the hard drive of client files sitting outside the door? Things being delivered sometimes need to be processed in a timely manner. An extra day to handle something doesn't sound like much until your calendar is jammed.

>printers cost $300 for home office

Depending on your practice area, you might need a real office printer. Scan to email is much faster when you don't have to reload 50 pages at a time into a $300 POS printer, because the way more expensive/capable office printer is collecting dust in the filing room.

>Maybe you need a part time receptionist, but probably not more.

One of the things you didn't mention is that clients and prospective clients will take you more seriously if you have a full time office presence. These people are usually going through something stressful, and little things like that make them have morre confidence in you as a professional. That is just the reality.

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish. 

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

> Road warrior here. I’ve been doing this now for a little over 12 years and I actually really love it. I’m lucky enough that I get to choose my own destiny and control most of how and where I travel (but not always). A few things that I do to help keep it interesting - YMMV.   
  
• Early flights only where possible. No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   
  
• Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. 

• Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. 

• Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   
  
• Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    
  
• Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   
  
• Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   
  
• Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   
  
• Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  
  
• Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   
  
• One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   
  
• Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   
  
• Know when to break the routine. If you’re going to a com

> How well the firm did over the year, how much cash they have on hand at the end of the year, and how much they value the person getting the bonus.  

I've heard of small plaintiff's firms that landed a huge verdict doling out BIG bonuses to everyone - not just associates.  If you work in a firm with three attorneys and five staffers and the firm gets (for example) a $5 million fee, I could totally see them giving the five staffers $25K+ bonuses.  That's a drop in the bucket with a fee that big, but it could be life-changing for a receptionist making $50K per year.

> As others have noted, short duration call penalties are for *outgoing* calls, as a way to either deter or better monetize cold callers, scammers, etc. who tend to get hung up on a lot.

It should not be coming up in the context of incoming calls unless you're immediately forwarding those calls out somewhere else making them count as both.

If that's what's happening, like you're immediately forwarding to an answering service where the caller then hangs up, stop doing that and land it first on an IVR or something that can provide the basic details and then only forwards out if the caller selects to speak to a human.

If you really aren't doing anything like that then I'd suggest checking your call records to ensure you aren't dealing with a compromised system where someone else is using it to scam people.

If neither of those are the case and it really is just inbound calling then I'd take it to a billing rep and consider changing carriers if they can't help.

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> Not for me.  I worked harder and made less.  Even more work was not billable, and I couldn’t justifiably bill at my prior firm rate ($100/hr less).  Plus, I had significantly more expenses (office, malpractice insurance, internet, Lexis, billing system, CPA, taxes, Ruby virtual receptionist, LawPay, CLEs and memberships, bar dues, computer and printer/copier systems, website design and hosting, advertising, and a coverage attorney contractor for hearings that conflicted or for assistance when I was swamped).  Plus, I had a wider range of less reliable clients that resulted in a reduced collection rate and more time and effort to be paid fully.  Also, my personal health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance, 401k retirement savings, paid vacation, and other benefits were gone.  It wasn’t easy and resulted in a net about $20k less than I made at the firm and no vacation, which was fine for me until I got married and had a child.  Some years were better and I made more than at the firm, but never more than 10-15% more and always with way more hassle.  #freedom

> I went to law school so I could sue big companies and hold wrongdoers responsible for the injuries they cause. 

I love representing Plaintiffs who are really hurt. Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. 

If...

If only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. 

I had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. 

One quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. 

There are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  

In the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.

But oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. 

Then there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. 

When they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. 

Oddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. 

Your client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

> TL;DR: You can go solo and there are TONS of ways to do so! 

  
Meh. It depends. You can work up to an easy solo "Ronin" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  

You can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do "DSS Defense" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).

The worst part (for me) is the "running a business" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a "brick and mortar" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that "Gen-X Joke" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  


The #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  


14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)

> The easiest and best thing to do if you feel underpaid is to apply to other jobs and cultivate other opportunities. If they are offering more, then you can take an offer from one of them to your current employer and ask for an increase. If your current employer will not increase, then go work elsewhere. 

There is no right or wrong salary amount.  Employers generally will pay people what they are willing to accept for the work being performed. If an employer hires a receptionist that the employer thinks is incredible, and the receptionist only ask to be paid $10 an hour, it is not the responsibility of the employer to say, “No no no, I much prefer to pay you much higher than you are asking for.”

That’s not saying an employer shouldn’t pay more for great employees. If employers don’t want great employees even to consider going elsewhere, employers can stay on top of what competitors are paying and just match that without the employees even asking. 

So basically, develop your worth as an employee, and if you want to know what others would pay you, cultivate other opportunities and find out. Plus, asking for a raise without having a backup option is never a good idea.

> > this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?

No, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).

Phones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.

Another thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as "line 1" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.

Usually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with "unlimited" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.

It sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.

If you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.

If your users actually want fax or want "Line 1/2/3" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

> I'm going to first put two pieces of advice I wrote in a different thread, slightly modifie; then address some of your specific questions:

I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. 

Here is what you need to make this work.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps

> For an experienced attorney, “paid for what you bill” can work. I work part time, irregular hours and this is how I’m paid, *at my preference and by my specific request*. But I’ve been doing this for 20 years and I don’t have to cover for the receptionist in a pinch anymore. And I “bill”all my admin time and get paid for it. 

That structure makes zero sense for a law clerk. You should be paid hourly, period. If they thought you weren’t billing enough time for what they pay they needed to talk to you about how to increase billable time, not steal your non-billable time. If you’re billing 8 hours a day that means you’re working more than 8 hours a day and they’re stealing your overtime, too.  You work for shitty people.

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

> I’m a solo and I do everything myself. Many of my colleagues are solos (family law) and they all use the same 2 people for billing. I don’t want my colleagues knowing what I’m billing and I don’t mind doing it. I used to have an office share, sharing a receptionist and conference rooms and having a Mail Drop. I went there twice in one year, so I got rid of that and solely WFH unless I’m in court, which I am every day. I think at this point I’m too cheap to pay someone and if they call my cell phone, I just let it go to VM until I’m ready to answer about ten calls at once. I always did my own calendaring and wouldn’t let anyone touch that. Honestly I love the freedom.

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu

> We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)

Hey everyone! We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

> Agreed, it should never be this way. I ran a firm for years before switching to back-office support services. The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for "the benefit of the firm's KPIs."

It needs to be simple:

- Incoming call
- Answer
- Name
- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. 
- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. 
- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. 

The firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. 

If your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.

> I just got done launching my solo PI firm this first week of 2025! Thank you for this list, I definitely referenced it a few times. I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:

1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my "finalist" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer "office" over "firm".

2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my "finalist" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, "first.lastinjurylawoffice.com" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. 

3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. 

4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. "Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert." If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. 

5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. 

6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free

7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) 

8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. 

9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. 

10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. 

11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. 

12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.

> Seems like we’re in similar positions. I only get referrals & they close pretty quickly. But cold selling is tough.

I was going to say they have the brand name, but then you said they were startups.

Did you go to 4 demos of startups? Kind of lost me there.

Anyways, there are a couple ways i’ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.

1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day—absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.

2. GHL dudes cold-calling—These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They’re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. 

3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. 

Lastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. 

Also, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.

> Thank you so much for posting this. Huge fan of BNI here as well. I went out as a solo in September and took around 50 cases from my prior firm. I am now handling around 70-80 cases with no para/assistant and between answering the phones, attending court, sending medical record requests, keeping up with discovery and making sure my clients are seeing the  PT/Orthos etc- it's getting a little hectic.  I knew a few of my big cases would pop this year and since September I have made $350k+ before taxes which is more than I have ever made- so I have some money to spend on assistance and help.  
(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  


(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.

Random Story:

I love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a "steak knife salesman" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.
