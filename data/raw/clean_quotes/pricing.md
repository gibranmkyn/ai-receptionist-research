> I still do free consults, but as soon as someone mentions "quick question," "free," "small problem," I say that the purposes of the consult is to ensure that our firm can help with their issue, then briefly describe how we might approach such a case to make sure we're a good fit for the client.  Then say something like, my professional liability insurance provider would not like me to review documents or provide legal advice without a signed engagement agreement. 

Yesterday, I had a call where the client wanted me to review and agreement and tell them how to get out of their obligations.  I gave them my speech and they say, "we definitely don't want to engage a lawyer or pay for this."  OK, if things change and you would like to engage a lawyer, feel free to call me back.

If they do have a question or issue that isn't worth engaging an attorney and I can point them to some helpful resources or give some general guidance in five minutes, I'll do that.  

Hard cap of 15 minutes and calls only, unless this person is almost certainly going to turn into a paying client.  My receptionist screens out people outside of our practice area, but even if she thinks they're a bit crazy/unserious, I want to talk with them.  Cut them off at 5 minutes if they're disrespectful, "sorry, too busy/not my practice/whatever, here's the phone number for the bar association's lawyer referral service."

> I rent from Regus/MyHQ which had been great.  Very comporable rates with other space in the area but actually lower since all utilities are included and we all share a receptionist.  I get a nice big kitchen area with appliances and up to 2 hours per day in a meeting room also included.  It also has all the necessary office machines in case mine ever goes down.  There is a much larger nicer meeting room with all the trimmings but that you have to pay for.  Reasonable rate.  Perfect for me because the free room is quite large.  Would only need the bigger room in the case of a full deposition that would go longer than two hours.  

But they also have flexibility.  If you need more soace they have bigger offices so you would be moving next door not across town.  Or you can add on smaller offices or release some you already have to downsize.  You can also use their facilities anywhere.  So I can pop in and use a meeting room in the next county if need be.  They are all over the place.  

That is at least one option to look into.

> Your age is not an issue.  Your GPA will be an issue for getting into a law school, but you're probably already knocked out of consideration of the higher ranked schools (I had a 2.7 coming out of college and was in the lowest quarter of my entering class).

I generally try to dissuade people from going to law school mainly because the price tag isn't worth it.  Most people coming out of law school are not going to have jobs that earn enough money to live and pay back the monstrous loans.  Those that are capable of paying their loans take on extremely soul-sucking jobs to do so.  

The apprenticing model in California requires you to work in a lawyer's office.  If you're interested at all, I would try to find a non-attorney job (like a paralegal or investigator) to get into an office and show you what the industry is like.  My first job out of college was as a receptionist for a small law firm in Boston.  I did go on to law school, but never landed a "real" law job afterwards and now I do compliance for the Federal Government.  It took almost twenty years after graduating to get to a comfortable spot.  Not lucrative, but comfortable.

> I think the main problem is that you will have a very hard time attracting your ideal of "institutional clients or sophisticated defendants charged with white collar crimes".

If I'm in their shoes, I would want a lawyer who is very experienced in white collar crime (you only have 5 years as a lawyer), someone who has support with paralegals or associate lawyers (so they can handle it if the case gets big with lots of witnesses or documents), someone who has experience in the local legal market so they have relationships with the prosecutors to have a better chance at making deals (you're a transplant so you don't know the prosecutors), and someone who they can get a referral for from a friend/colleague/the other lawyers that they pay instead of just picking a name out of Google (you don't have a local network). 

I don't know why these clients would pick you, instead of a lawyer who meets more of those criteria. The only thing you might be able to compete on clearly is price, but these clients have money and would probably prefer to pay more if they got a better perceived chance of success in their criminal case. I can't see a handful of internet ads you pay for changing any of that.

If your plan was more a more general criminal law focus, I think you'd be ok. You might also try to push federal criminal defense as a subspeciality, in my state it's often notably harder to find a lawyer to practice in federal court compared to state court.

If you want some complexity to keep yourself interested, dip your toes into 1983 civil rights cases. A certain percent of your generic criminal law clients will have viable cases, plus you can try to network in your criminal defense lawyer groups for these sort of referrals (the vast majority just refer these cases out).

Also, you need some sort of actual or virtual receptionist to field calls for you.  If people call and they get a voicemail, they usually hang up instead of leaving a message.

sounds like with two full-time staffers he has over 100 cases or more? 

how many work for you?

> “Outsourcing” is a vague term. That’s why this question can’t be answered. 

Potential meanings of outsourcing:

* what you said, giving work to firm B when you have too much work
* hiring temporary attorneys to do legal work. There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work
* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn’t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly. Hiring a provider to answer your phone can be much cheaper and be 24/7.
* you can outsource things like intake or generating social media posts/blog posts, etc.

> Agreed 100%.  It really is starting an entire business from scratch and there are so many parts of it we don't really see in a big law firm.  So when you say support staff, to me that means my practice assistant/paralegal, my office manager and my receptionist (I'm not a solo practitioner, I'm at a law firm).  But what I don't readily see or think of are the support staff for IT, marketing, business development, budgeting, HR, compliance, and all of the other business sides of the firm.  It's very daunting.

> Very interesting insight. I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers. I honestly think in the next 15-20 years that having a real person answer the phone will make any company stand out.

> I personally think Clio is the biggest waste of time possible, but my current Of Counsel home insists on it, mainly for conflicts checks. They pay for it as part of their split.

I personally find that Clio just adds an extra layer of hassle because it doesn't integrate well with outlook, doesn't integrate at all with mobile (seriously, I can't email a PDF on mobile?? In 2024???), and I have to constantly reinstall it when I switch from desktop to laptop.

So, after a few weeks of fighting with it I just save everything to dropbox first and then drag it over to clio. If I need to email someone a PDF from my phone, dropbox makes it possible. Whatever. It's their money and I'm a team player.

As for a receptionist, I don't see the need. The clients and realtors get my cell. On the extremely rare occasions that a client abuses this privilege, caller ID saves the day and I just decline the calls, close the deal, and never work with that client again.

If those systems help you make more money than they cost you, though, more power to you. Always interesting to see how different systems work in different set ups.

### 11. r/LawFirm — 2025-05-15 | Quality: ?/5

> Okay so I’ve read the responses posted by other attorneys who have had “bad experiences” with legalmatch and I would like to share my story.

I’m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.

Within the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn’t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.

6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person. I was finally comfortable spending 4k a month on a PI membership and the 1,400 on my criminal membership but my key account person got me a better deal I got the combo membership for only 4,600/month. The criminal clients are paying for this membership and then some. On the PI membership some of the clients are very good a lot are trash, but, the day a case came in involving a Walmart truck that killed someone I jumped on it and I settled for 7.5 million from that case. Now I’m taking PI statewide and Criminal only in the metropolitan I live in.

Anyone who says this didn’t work for them. It’s because they didn’t work the program. I have notifications on for my mobile app, my secretary is logged in on her phone and computer and I get emails. The two of us click on every new case as soon as it gets on and she’s trained to know a good vs a bad client and we respond right away. Either she’s calling to set up a consult or I’m calling to begin the consult and get them into the firm. The only time I’ve ever missed out on a client I was on vacation and my receptionist’s phone died. With there being a limited number of attorneys in each group this is unlike any other lead service, and I’ve used a lot of them.

You can listen to me or the losers just know I’m living much more comfortably now. I will always swear by legalmatch.

### 12. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-03 | Quality: ?/5

> Not a lawyer, but I’ve used them a bunch over the years, both personally and for our businesses.

In 2018 I was sued over lease hold agreement. This was the landlord for commercial building that my business was renting and leased for several years. He was suing us because he changed the terms of the lease about two years into attend your lease he did not ask he did not offer: he demanded and proclaimed that they were changing and we had no choice.  

The attorney I was using at that time was in her third year with a local firm. At one point about two months after the first service, something happened at the Law Firm and the next time I called to talk to her the receptionist or secretary sent me to a different attorney who told me that he was taking over the case because she was no longer with that firm. I asked him if her departure had anything to do with any of our current work, to which he replied no. 

Once we started talking about the next response, it was obvious that not only had he not read the case file, he incorrectly summarized what he had read, and wasn’t at all interested in listening. 

Once I hung up with him, I called my former attorneys cell phone, and asked her how she th was doing. We spoke for about 10 minutes, and at that time, she was very adroit at never even implying or allowing inference through omission that there was anything untoward at her former firm.

Before the call, I told her that I wasn’t entirely certain about my comfort with the new council, but I wasn’t sure about the ethics, and politics,… We are a rather small town… surrounding whether she might be able to take up my case again. 

That night, one of our friends who has a relative who works at the old Law Firm said that not only was our attorney gone, but one of the senior partners was gone, and there had been a  settlement with my attorney having to do with something “not right” happening between the senior partner and her. 

TLDR: IANAL but I will definitely follow any attorney I’m working with -who I trust - if they leave a firm while they’re working on one of my cases.  

Preempt: I’ve never initiated a lawsuit, although I have counter-sued. most of the words that I have for attorneys is contractual and or mineral rights associated.

> **Answering Your Question:**

Be optimisic. It's hard to tell over text, but I feel like the tone you're asking the question in is a frustrated one. High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.

Some of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:

* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.
* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.
* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level. This is normal and required an atitidue adjustment on my part to get the most out of my internship. Understand you're not being treated poorly, the things they're trying to teach you are likely just very different from anything you've ever worked with.

I'd also like to clarify that the I began work for the firm I am with now while I was in high school, so I understand your position. In my direct experience, you have to get your foot in the door doing absolute grunt work and then go from there. Through an ICE program, I was the morning receptionist at out main location for about 6 months until they could hire someone full-time. It wasn't until that point that I was given a position I actually enjoyed. 

Now a year later, I'm about to start college and the dynamic I have with the firm is beggining to change. It just takes time.



**Some general advice for starting a career before you have an undergrad degree:**

Once you have your foot in the door, set yourself apart. I took tons of side-projects while also doing reception work, typically on the bussiness management side, and our managing partner started to lean on me to deal with some of the administrative things he didn't enjoy. 

With resumes, I also recommend you follow the guides listed by top universities. I did tons of unpaid work on political campaigns before this position, which wasn't fun but beefed up my resume and gave me real-world experience. When creating my resume, I based it off the placement office resources at Indiana University, Harvard University, and MIT. Your resume should absolutely be a single page. I'd be happy to send you mine if you do want a reference. Timing is also important. Push your resume to as many firms as you can.

> Not trying to be a jerk, but I would dissuade you from this course of action. The fact that you “love to argue about the law” and are interested in crime and politics are really not good reasons to go spend three+ years and a bunch of money only to get spit out low on the totem pole into a grueling and largely unfulfilling profession where you have like a 10% chance at finding something that even somewhat resembles your expectation of what lawyers do.

If you are serious about this, and this is a thoroughly well thought out plan where you understand the cost/benefit, I would make SURE you shadow some attorneys first. Not the glamorous side of the job, but actually try to see under the hood. Maybe even take a part time gig as a receptionist or assistant at a small law firm for a few months on your non-nursing days. I think you will be surprised at what you find. Just like nursing is not like Grey’s Anatomy, law is not like Suits.

### 15. r/agency — 2025-02-14 | Quality: ?/5

> This is tricky but I can share some industry standards.

For my clients I recommend considering 70% “at capacity“ If you have fewer than ten employees. (Contractors don’t count because they aren’t fixed costs). 

That’s about 30 hours a week per billable employee. 

This is not just to allow work that isn‘t billable, it’s to put some slack in your schedule to better respond to clients and opportunities. its hard to respond if you are at 100% utilization. 

Now not all employees are billable. For example, a receptionist or bookkeeper, CFO, etc. 

That gives you your rough ceiling. If the founder only spends half their time on billable work, you account for that (15 hrs a week). 

So 6 hours a day for production people is “at capacity” 4.85 is low. 

Another issue is timekeeping. Time keeping will always lag behind ACTUAL TIME spent on billable work because people forget to enter time for small things - multiply that five minute email here and that 15 min internal client discussion X ten people = a lot of “lost” time. 

You are over staffed. One of the biggest and most expensive mistakes I made was not cutting staff fast enough. We would work on elaborate internal projects - great work but bad practice. 

Drive more billable hours or cut 1-2 people.

I use SmithAI for receptionist, and while not perfect, me and my para are mostly off the phones  and able to bill more, and the pricing is reasonable. 

It’s hard to cut corners, so I try and keep prices such that I don’t have to cut much unless I really want to.

> Either a cloud based phone system with a cloud based SIP phone service provider or a cloud based answering service or call center type solution would remove a lot of the limitations you currently have. It seems the rules of this sub say that I can’t recommend products or services so I guess that’s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There’s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!

> The quickest way to lose a sale with me is to try to use time as a pressure point.  Rarely will a couple days be enough time for me to realistically evaluate what you're selling, so be prepared to adjust the trial period. Likewise, don't tell me that the price is only available if I commit right away -- if you're selling me something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars over a lifetime, I need to take my time, and as a solo, I don't have time to spend hours at a time making a decision right away.  A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.  Needless to say, I declined to consider them after that.

> Thanks!

I get a third of what they make so basically a 1/3 of the 1/3 they make or 1/9 of the settlement

All cases would come from them, he says he has plenty of cases and could give me 30 tomorrow.

I am unsure about how the origintlate structure would work but I dont plan on bringing much in.

He didnt say the tax classification

No benefits, he says the firm isnt big enough to offer them.

He said there was a pre lit team but said I would be doing all the work myself when it got to me, there is a couple receptionists.

Yeah I asked about training, he said I would get fully trained with the most senior partner and they would be happy to help because I would be learning by doing their work basically so that would be motivation for them.

The next step in the process would be for me to email him and ask for a second interview where I would talk to and meet the rest of the attorneys. Not sure after reading this comments if itd be worth it

> I started my own solo practice in January. 12 year lawyer here doing PI/civil defense. Since going solo I have expanded a bit into criminal and some admin stuff that I've dabbled in before but never had the time.

1. Malpractice Insurance - get a few quotes, should be 1000-1500/year  
2. Laptop/Printer (I got a 400 dollar one with a scanner/fax that is not set up lol)  
3. Website - I built my own in SquareSpace. I signed up for Canva free trial and used that to create firm logo and "branding package" aka the colors and fonts to use for consistency.   
4. Stack. I use Office 365, Adobe, QuickBooks, Zoom phone number. The Zoom number routes to my MIL who will serve as a receptionist (calls are intermittent) I will eventually pick up a case management software but I only have a few files and have a file structure in OneDrive that mimics the file structure of the large case management system I used at my last job.  
5. A private mailbox down the street for business mail.   
6. A meager marketing budget (think business cards, joining a local marketing group, sponsoring local group sports teams/etc). I wouldn't bother with google ads or anything. I spent 1k on google ads and the calls were utter trash. Instead the organic marketing has brought me crazy referrals.

I have a virtual office so I spent a few hundred dollars revamping my home office and passed on formal office space. If a client wants to meet, many of them are not near me/where my office would be so they do not want to meet anyway. Lots of library rooms reserved, coffee shops, things like that. 

I've only been a solo for 10 weeks but in Feb I made what I made last February and in March I will have made 1.75x my previously monthly salary, and am arguably only "working" part time right now.
