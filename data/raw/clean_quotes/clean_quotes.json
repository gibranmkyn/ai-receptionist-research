    "text": "Nothing is ever \"normal\" when you are talking about small firms.  When you are small, you are basically run off the personality of the partner(s).  \n\nWith that said, in your first year, your experience is similar to my time working at small firms.  From a firm's preceptive, it is cheaper to send you to serve a document and bill the client instead of paying upfront for a process server and waiting for the client to reimburse you.  And if you are worried about it being done right, you send an attorney instead of the receptionist or other assistant.  As the low person on the totem pole, that job goes to you.\n\nI will say, I hated being the attorney/paralegal/assistant/receptionist at the small firm I worked at.  But, it forced me to learn all those little things that you would not learn at a bigger firm.  When I eventually moved to a bigger firm that actually had support, I truly appreciated the work support staff did and made sure to prep my work to make their tasks easier.  Its also prepared me to handle emergency situations where people are sick and things needs to be done right.",

    "text": "There's nothing obnoxious about hiring a personal assistant. What's obnoxious is hiring a legal assistant, receptionist, or other law firm staff and then expecting that person to do personal tasks like picking up dry cleaning.\n\nIt's a common problem in very small firms - especially if there's two partners and they're married to each other! - for the owner/partners to fail to maintain enough separation between their personal and professional lives.  It causes drama and dissatisfaction.  Don't ask your legal secretary to do personal errands; the secretary will resent doing them and your partner will resent paying for them.  If personal services are what you need the most help with, hire a personal assistant, on your own dime not the firm's; be clear about your expectations, treat the assistant with respect and pay them well.  \n\nAlso don't ask either a legal assistant or a personal assistant to clean the office.  Get a janitor for that.",

    "text": "Actually just worked on a project where we tried to Define and write down the specific job duties for legal secretaries and paralegals.    \n\nSome of this is going to be very specific to the environment.  For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. \n\nWhat we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training \n\nAttorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. \n\nSecond, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. \n\n\nA really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. \n\nHowever getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done. At the beginning it will definitely take longer because you are having to teach someone how to do it rather than simply do it yourself. \n\nWith that said a good paralegal should be able to\n- keep files in order and ensure new items are filed correctly. \n- keep up with notes and summaries enabling an attorney to catch up on a file quickly \n- draft simple documents like cover letters and rote pleadings from forms for your approval.  (You dont need to be a lawyer to write \"the defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 7\" over and over again). \n- calendar deadlines\n- work on service of process \n\n\nIf you are the manager. Think about 5 tasks that you feel like waste your time and keep you from doing productive work.  Write down step by step directions for those tasks and then talk to a paralegal. \n\nIf you are a junior person in a larger entity, talk to partners/managers about what the paralegals do.  They might already ve occupied or feel that they give partners tasks priority.",

Then say something like, my professional liability insurance provider would not like me to review documents or provide legal advice without a signed engagement agreement. \n\nYesterday, I had a call where the client wanted me to review and agreement and tell them how to get out of their obligations.

    "text": "Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.\n\nI was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).\n\n1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same \u201creceptionist\u201d answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn\u2019t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;\n\n2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal\u2026\u2026\u2026and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I\u2019d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc\u2019s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I\u2019m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it\u2019s not a lot, but I\u2019m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she\u2019s a part of my life now. 10/10\n\n***Extra bonus: she thinks I\u2019m too skinny and brings in donuts. \n\n****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I\u2019m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I\u2019ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).\n\n3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn\u2019t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t",

    "text": "Technically no, but there are so many ways case management software processes help you for the future. \n\n1. CYA: I document everything - every call, every action, everything in the case management software. When I need a certificate of conference on a motion to compel I can filter the notes in the file and pull any tagged \"Defense counsel\" and grab the dates to list how many times I conferred with defense on the issue. I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. \n\n2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. \n\n3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from \"service\" to \"litigation\" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. \n\n4. Expansion: You're a new solo, but if you want to bring on staff or other attorneys in the future, having a CMS prevents things like accidentally deleting a line in the excel sheet, usually gives essentially version control to most stuff in the file, and allows you to set standard processes that let you train staff, make sure they're doing their work, assign tasks and grow responsibly. But in order to do that, it's so much easier to set up the processes before you have them and it's just you. build a foundation with an eye towards expansion so you're not trying to create processes and adjust to the new CMS when you've got two paralegals and a receptionist.",

This is a primary function for some support staff.\n\n>mail can be picked up\n\nI said deliveries. There are deliveries from clients and counsel all the time, some of which need to be signed for.

Scan to email is much faster when you don't have to reload 50 pages at a time into a $300 POS printer, because the way more expensive/capable office printer is collecting dust in the filing room.\n\n>Maybe you need a part time receptionist, but probably not more.\n\nOne of the things you didn't mention is that clients and prospective clients will take you more seriously if you have a full time office presence. These people are usually going through something stressful, and little things like that make them have morre confidence in you as a professional. That is just the reality.",

They read more like 'friends' or colleagues. Generic praise for the attorney and/or experience 'working with them' which can be anything. And zero reviews on yelp at the same time.

It's unfortunate but a lot of the attorneys are probably working for a temp service, answering service, or are just highly underpaid. PI is one of those fields of law where a lot of staff can be helpful, whereas my firm has 3 attorneys and no staff (a full-time receptionist is next though, it's too much). Case mills tend to underpay people and churn through staff like crazy and cheap out whenever possible. \n\nAs to the offshoring work, it's actually pretty common for stuff like calling for medical records requests and formulaic, admin HIPAA stuff. I've only seen the bigger case mills do it, and it's not really a great sign that the firm cares about your case specifically IMO, but that sort of work doesn't really need to be highly skilled either.",

IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. \n\nSecond, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. \n\nThird, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. \n\nFinally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.",

No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   \n  \n\u2022 Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. \n\n\u2022\u00a0Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. \n\n\u2022\u00a0Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   \n  \n\u2022 Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Know when to break the routine.

Get a biz card to hand out.\n\nFocus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.\n\nKeep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.\n\nReduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.\n\nAccept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a \"steady\" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.\n\nGood luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.",

But now the \u201coffice manager\u201d has to justify his job, and that means harassing the lawyers and paralegals. And now we have an \u201coffice manager\u201d and a \u201cCRM specialist\u201d who are just overhead, so we gotta BILL BILL BILL!\n\n4) so the firm\u2019s owner decided it was time to cut costs\u2026 FINALLY! Ok, good, we will be back on track \ud83d\ude42\u2026. Wait, how is he going to cut costs? By doing the same greedy little thing you suggested, he fired an attorney and one parelegal so he could hire 3 \u201cvirtual paralegals\u201d based in India and Philippines and a \u201cforeign attorney\u201d from India who does the stuff and sends it to the other attorneys to review because he can\u2019t really do the attorney job without a US license, so now there is even more stuff on the (real) attorney\u2019s plate, who are already getting choked by the ridiculous KPIs and harassment they\u2019re subject to because they have to pay for the overhead cause by the office manager and the CRM guy.\n\nGuess how the firm is doing now? Hint; I got the heck out of there because it\u2019s a sinking ship. They were just fine from a profitability perspective and from a legal quality perspective until these \u201camazing optimizations\u201d and \u201cimprovements in efficiency\u201d were implemented.\n\nLast I heard this firm is not worried about their rapidly declining profitability because \u201cthey will use AI to improve efficiency\u201d, so I guess they are firing a paralegal or two, maybe even an attorney, \u201cai and smart forms will do it all\u201d.",

What I did today included (but was not limited to) attending a weekly practice group coordination meeting, reviewing an updated closing checklist received from lender counsel and emailing her a document that was done but hadn't been sent to her yet, conferring with an associate about an unusual tax issue in a contract we're working on together and making some revisions to the contract, responding to an email from a client about a minor change he wants to the draft contract I sent him last week, drafting an operating agreement amendment and a couple of authorizing resolutions and sending them to my supervising attorney for review before they go to lender counsel.  Next on my list is drafting an easement agreement, which I'll send to a different supervising attorney for review before it goes to the client. \n\n\n\nI've been doing this work for a long time, but even less experienced paralegals should not be spending a lot of time answering calls, making copies, and scanning.  It sounds like you want a secretary/legal assistant, or possibly just a receptionist or file clerk.  And if you're constantly asking paralegals to do admin support work, it's not terribly surprising that they've just stopped responding to you.  Although based on your description of the general situation in your organization, I have to wonder, who hired these paralegals, what *is* their actual job description, and how are their duties assigned?  It's unlikely that they truly aren't doing *anything*, so what is it that they *are* doing and why is it invisible to you and other lawyers?  Presumably in a nonprofit you don't have the billable/nonbillable distinctions that generally separate paralegals from LAs, and you may very well not have an abundance of staff so the job descriptions of those you do have may need to be hybrid.  But clearly there's a mismatch of expectations.  And you're not going to resolve that without involving whatever the higher management level is in your company - the general counsel, perhaps, or whoever is the administrator of the legal department.",

Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. \n\nIf...\n\nIf only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. \n\nI had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. \n\nOne quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. \n\nThere are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  \n\nIn the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.\n\nBut oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. \n\nThen there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. \n\nWhen they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. \n\nOddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. \n\nYour client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money.

You can work up to an easy solo \"Ronin\" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  \n\nYou can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do \"DSS Defense\" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).\n\nThe worst part (for me) is the \"running a business\" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \\~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a \"brick and mortar\" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that \"Gen-X Joke\" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  \n\n\nThe #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  \n\n\n14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)",

If an employer hires a receptionist that the employer thinks is incredible, and the receptionist only ask to be paid $10 an hour, it is not the responsibility of the employer to say, \u201cNo no no, I much prefer to pay you much higher than you are asking for.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not saying an employer shouldn\u2019t pay more for great employees. If employers don\u2019t want great employees even to consider going elsewhere, employers can stay on top of what competitors are paying and just match that without the employees even asking. \n\nSo basically, develop your worth as an employee, and if you want to know what others would pay you, cultivate other opportunities and find out. Plus, asking for a raise without having a backup option is never a good idea.",

I\u2019m happy with mycase, but it can\u2019t hurt to see what you\u2019re using. \n\nI think you\u2019re in estate planning. If so, you should reach out to divorce lawyers in the area that you service. Explain to them that once their clients are divorced they\u2019ll need a new estate plan. (obviously you have to focus on the divorce lawyers that service the middle-class and upper class.) offer them a referral fee. I imagine you\u2019ll get a fair amount of work.\n\nI\u2019m curious as to why you need Lexis. I\u2019m not throwing any shade. I mean it\u2019s an honest question. Estate planning law changes slowly. I run a family law firm 82.7% of our time is spent on Paternity, Divorce, and family law post judgment order modification. The rest is spent doing estate planning for our middle and upper class clients post judgment. \n\nI read what used to be called the advanced sheets\u2014 that is the appellate cases and state Supreme Court cases relevant to family law as they come out. They are free and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re free in your state too. On September 1, 2024 my state, California, modified the algebra equation we use to calculate child support. Legal news reported it six months before it happened so no surprises for us.\n\nDepending on how much you\u2019re earning the 350 you\u2019re gonna be paying for Lexus could be significant and might be a cost you can do without\n\nI found that if you focus on a certain area such as estate planning or family law, the amount of new laws very modest and as a result, Alexis or West law subscription is unnecessary  (using fastlaw) to ensure any cases you cite are up-to-date (ie Shepardize the cases).\n\nI\u2019m very interested in your virtual legal assistant. And I\u2019d love it if you had the time too expand on that either on this post or DM. I have four experience, legal assistance and office manager one real receptionist +4 virtual receptionists that we pay for as an expense words I don\u2019t give them 1099s. \n\nI love my virtual receptionists. I\u2019ve made an effort to get to know them and to be interested in them at least superficially and they really do a great job for us. The way we have it set up. Is potential clients go to me or to the office manager. and we can switch that up on the fly. My unique sales proposition is that I have a lot of litigation experience,  so I\u2019m in court three days out of five. But I don\u2019t always have to spend the entire day there. Plus our court takes a lunch break from 12 to 130 during which I spent a portion of my time prepping the parties and witnesses for the second half of the day and a portion of my time returning calls.\n\nI think it\u2019s important that the owner of the firm takes client calls often.   I\u2019m personable. I speak plainly and I am the person who is best able to judge whether the client is a good fit.",

Would only need the bigger room in the case of a full deposition that would go longer than two hours.  \n\nBut they also have flexibility.  If you need more soace they have bigger offices so you would be moving next door not across town.  Or you can add on smaller offices or release some you already have to downsize.  You can also use their facilities anywhere.  So I can pop in and use a meeting room in the next county if need be.  They are all over the place.  \n\nThat is at least one option to look into.",

As the highest biller (sometimes bringing in more than senior attorneys) and getting the same bonus as the file clerk and receptionist - it made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. It also felt horrible when law clerks and associates would get sometimes a bonus that equaled a partner share - when a lot of their billable hours were written off and mine was always charged. Not to mention - no raises. \n\nI always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. \n\nWhen a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. \n\nRemember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. \n\nJust my thoughts!",

    "text": "> this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?\n\nNo, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).\n\nPhones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.\n\nAnother thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as \"line 1\" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.\n\nUsually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with \"unlimited\" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.\n\nIt sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.\n\nIf you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.\n\nIf your users actually want fax or want \"Line 1/2/3\" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.",

They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well\n\n2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done\n\n3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.\n\n4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  \n\n5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.\n\n6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.\n\nGood luck and hang in there.",

    "text": "I'm going to first put two pieces of advice I wrote in a different thread, slightly modifie; then address some of your specific questions:\n\nI'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. \n\nHere is what you need to make this work.\n\n1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.\n2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.\n3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.\n4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.\n\n> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.\n\nPart of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.\n\n> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.\n\n> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?\n\nYes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). \n\nNow - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.\n\nCAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.\n\nThat sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. \n\n> When did you decide to add an associate?\n\nWhen we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).\n\n> Do you build a big cash cushion first?\n\nYes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.\n\n> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....\n\nAgreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps",

AI can draft a lot of your closing documents, for instance although you probably have software to do that efficiently. I haven\u2019t yet found it ready for prime time but AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road. I think it\u2019ll be ready soon if it isn\u2019t yet. I would keep your W-2 headcount to a minimum.",

If they thought you weren\u2019t billing enough time for what they pay they needed to talk to you about how to increase billable time, not steal your non-billable time. If you\u2019re billing 8 hours a day that means you\u2019re working more than 8 hours a day and they\u2019re stealing your overtime, too.  You work for shitty people.",

The four \"senior\" attorneys each have their own paralegals, whom they each pay individually, while us three junior attorneys do not have any support staff. Our receptionist completes basic tasks for everyone in the firm, like taking phone messages and putting postage on envelopes, but other than that we're each on our own. \n\nI actually pay one of the senior attorney's paralegals on the side (with permission) to draft stuff for me as needed. I'm in an awkward position where I'm not bringing in enough to hire my own full-time assistant yet, but I'm getting more work than what I can manage on my own. This arrangement works for now. But do I wish that our firm had legal assistants that were available to everyone? Yes. \n\nI'd like to hear from others how common this arrangement is, though. My friend is an associate at a medium-sized firm and thinks it's outrageous that I pay out of pocket for an assistant. He says that's something the firm ought to cover for associates, like Lexis and Clio (both of which I also pay out of pocket for). Everyone at my firm acts like it's totally normal, though, so I really don't know if this is the \"done\" thing?",

I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn\u2019t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don\u2019t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.",

I have received nothing but compliments so far and the callers have been shocked that its really Ai vs a live message and how quick I returned their call. Smith delivers the message immediately after the call ends via email. Another plus is how they can filter and block spam calls! The dashboard allows me to view, mark and block calls too.

We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.\n\nWe started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.\n\nWhat surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.\n\nSince making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.\n\nSince then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.\n\nWe would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.",

The system was less than impressive and customers hated using a menu-based system. Since switching to Ruby, our customers appreciate talking to a live person on the first ring. The operators know when to forward a priority call. We've already had to increase our minutes per month and we're maxing that out already. Our communication and outreach to the customer has been great. And the messages we receive are much more detailed than before. We're happy we made this switch.",

We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she\u2019d be there until everything was running smoothly.\n\nI had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, \"We can't do that for your company.\" I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.\n\nNow, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they\u2019ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me\u2014PATLive won me over from Day One!",

Amy Hearn was our on-boarding specialist and was wonderful through the whole set-up process & trial period. She explained everything we needed to know and was quick to answer any questions we had. When testing the call service operators each experience was positive and professional. Now we are past the on-boarding period and rely on daily message logs and their normal Customer Service Team which have also proven to be just as responsive.

Last time we had to hire we went through 3 hires who didn't work out before we found a good fit. We didn't have time to go through months of false starts again for this position... then we learned about Wing Assistant. Wing made the process so easy - they had an administrative assistant on within a few days and she has been terrific. She's very skilled in administrative functions, software and support best practices. Working with Wing gave us peace of mind because they did the recruiting, hiring and should we ever need a replacement, they would take care of that within days as well. We will definitely use Wing again when we need help. They can provide any level or skillset needed, plus they take care of the employee benefits, payroll, etc. I highly recommend their services.",

    "text": "We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.",

    "text": "I think the main problem is that you will have a very hard time attracting your ideal of \"institutional clients or sophisticated defendants charged with white collar crimes\".\n\nIf I'm in their shoes, I would want a lawyer who is very experienced in white collar crime (you only have 5 years as a lawyer), someone who has support with paralegals or associate lawyers (so they can handle it if the case gets big with lots of witnesses or documents), someone who has experience in the local legal market so they have relationships with the prosecutors to have a better chance at making deals (you're a transplant so you don't know the prosecutors), and someone who they can get a referral for from a friend/colleague/the other lawyers that they pay instead of just picking a name out of Google (you don't have a local network). \n\nI don't know why these clients would pick you, instead of a lawyer who meets more of those criteria. The only thing you might be able to compete on clearly is price, but these clients have money and would probably prefer to pay more if they got a better perceived chance of success in their criminal case. I can't see a handful of internet ads you pay for changing any of that.\n\nIf your plan was more a more general criminal law focus, I think you'd be ok. You might also try to push federal criminal defense as a subspeciality, in my state it's often notably harder to find a lawyer to practice in federal court compared to state court.\n\nIf you want some complexity to keep yourself interested, dip your toes into 1983 civil rights cases. A certain percent of your generic criminal law clients will have viable cases, plus you can try to network in your criminal defense lawyer groups for these sort of referrals (the vast majority just refer these cases out).\n\nAlso, you need some sort of actual or virtual receptionist to field calls for you.  If people call and they get a voicemail, they usually hang up instead of leaving a message.",

It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately.

I have to wear heels every day M-Th (my feet are in so much pain even though I haven't walked around much). We MUST bring a blazer everyday even though it is 100 degrees out and rarely cold here. (Important to note, the guy attorneys have dressed in blue jeans and t-shirts \ud83d\ude43 There are no female attorneys on staff).\n\nYeah this is super sexist. The men wear tshirts and the women have to wear blazers and heels? Wtf?? Very unsurprising that there's no female lawyers at this firm, your firm prob wouldn't hire them, only hires women to be support staff, and potentially wouldn't hire them as staff unless they're young and conventionally attractive. A lot of male bosses like hiring women to be staff but not lawyers cuz they feel female staff are less likely to ask for raises and more likely to be Your firm is sexist AF and could potentially get in trouble for gender discrimination.\n\n> Most of the support staff is young girls in our 20s (myself included). Most of us have only started working there in the past two years, majority within this year. I have heard rumors of a mass quitting of Case Managers but don\u2019t know anything beyond that.\n\nAaaaand I was right. Definitely a super sexist firm. The whole reason the other staff haven't been there that long is cuz everyone else quit. \n\n> very few coworkers really had any positive reviews of their experience.\n\nHow unsurprising lol.\n\n> the one time I briefly used my phone to decline my father's call and texted him that I was busy (took like 30s if I am being generous) I received a \"gentle\" reminder from the HR rep training me to stop using my phone. Again, I was on it for barely a couple seconds to decline a phone call. Another one of the receptionists up front was told to never wear her Apple Watch to work.\n\nYour bosses are fucking crazy. That's not normal at all. Don't be goofing off at your desk, but you did nothing wrong. If you can't even wear an apple watch to work that's crazy. It's like your firm has a really obvious pattern of controlling what their female employees wear...oh wait\n\n> There are cameras everywhere. Most of the supervisors (HR, head attorneys) have a bunch of tv screens in their office overlooking the rest of the staff's desks like a mall security guard.\n\nThe rampant sexism was already egregious, but this is the creepiest part. Security cameras are one thing, but those should be pointing towards doors and windows- not your employees. Many states have laws specifically banning this kind of stuff. How big is this firm? The smaller it is, the creepier it is. Even if it's big this is still insane. Orwell & Orwell is clearly a nightmare to work for. These psychos def spend a lot of time using their cameras to perv on their female staff. Make sure there's no cameras in the bathrooms, a place this vile would totally do something like that.

I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.\n\nFast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two \"back office\" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  \n\nFast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.\n\nFinally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my \"main line\" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.

    "text": "Do you think you were the victim of a bait and switch regarding the job you thought you were applying to? Or, once you were in the interview, did they determine that you don't have the skills they need for a legal assistant so they then pivoted to discussing a mailroom position? The distinction makes a big difference. If you applied to a job posted as \"legal assistant\" but they started off right away discussing a mailroom job, that's not a good sign and I probably wouldn't proceed with them. \n\nIf it's the latter and they said something like, \"I don't think your skills and experience match with our needs for a legal assistant at this point, but we're willing to move forward with a mailroom position,\" then that means they see something in you even though you might not be a fit for the original position. That would be a different story and I might consider moving forward.\n\nLaw firms can be great places to work and grow, and in my experience they often prefer promoting from within (it's easier to hire a new mailroom assistant or receptionist than an experienced legal assistant or paralegal). I've seen this happen many times. So it's completely reasonable that this could happen to you if you get the job. But remember job interviews are a two-way street. Dig into that a little more if you get a second interview and ask them how often they do promote from within, and make it clear to them that this is important to you. If they seem honest and sincere and you feel comfortable with the folks you've met and the answers to your questions, you might want to consider moving forward.",

    "text": "Is it court appearances the reason you want an associate?  I ask because I worked for a solo for over 20 years.  After about 5 years, the firm had grown, and I started taking over some of the lighter firm administrative duties, in addition to my lead litigation role.  We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.  My solo did securities litigation and arbitration (me), some personal injury, and elder law.  All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.\n\nMy boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.\n\nThis allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.\n\nBy the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.  We had such a great group of staff working there, so staff issues were minimal.\n\nHe also purchased a business condo, which turned out to be a wonderful firm investment. One securities case award was enough to pay it off and then served as an open line of credit if it was needed between awards/settlements.\n\nHe still calls me on occasion for advice.  He has his eye on winding down his practice, refers complex litigation to younger attorneys in other firms, and has built a great elder law practice, which keeps him quite comfortable.   He still has the same elder law paralegal.",

    "text": "I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. Here is what you need to make this work.\n\n1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.\n2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.\n3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.\n4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.\n\n> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.\n\nPart of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.\n\n> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.\n\n> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?\n\nYes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). \n\nNow - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.\n\nCAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.\n\nThat sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. \n\n> When did you decide to add an associate?\n\nWhen we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).\n\n> Do you build a big cash cushion first?\n\nYes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.\n\n> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....\n\nAgreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps a bit thankless, work. Check out appellate public defense work. I might be doing that if I wasn't doing this and had no loans. Last contract ",

For example, a single attorney probably doesn\u2019t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month.

    "text": "Here are my suggestions with some reasons.\n\nUse WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.\n\nGet at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.\n\nFor bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.\n\nConsider having an answering service to present a \"bigger\" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.\n\nFor hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:\n\nPrinter with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.\n\nSheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.\n\nGet a flatbed scanner if you need it.\n\nGet fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.\n\nGet a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.\n\nGet a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34\" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.\n\nSoftware oriented tools:\n\nPlease read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)\n\nNotice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the \u00e0 la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.\n\nOf course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.\n\nYou need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with",

    "text": "Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: \n\nMost of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)\n\nEach of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. \n\nThen it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. \n\nAt the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. \n\nOverall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.\n\nOnce they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. \n\nOverall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu",

There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:\n\nGood - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. \n\nBad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.\n\nWe would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.",

They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.\r\n\r\nInexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.",

Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them.

It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  \n\nI have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  \n\nYesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying \"put them into voicemail\".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.\n\nThe app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  \n\nRuby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.",

I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers.

    "text": "Maximumlawyer: I'm not a regular listener, but I was thinking through intake processes and those episodes were pretty good.\n\n[Smith.ai](https://Smith.ai): You have to keep your instructions and process simple enough that anyone can follow instructions. This is because any one of their employees might answer the phone, and they'll be looking at your instructions on a screen when they do so. \n\nThey will schedule on a calendar of your choice, or integrate with Clio for intake. They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!\n\nI've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.\n\nSo far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.",

    "text": "I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.\n\nFrom what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.\n\nAny sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.\n\nAnother hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.\n\nAI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.",

And I hate to say this, but since you were the one pushing for this change, I'm sure upper management is looking for you to fix it as well.  I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.\n\n- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.\n\n- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into production.\n\n- Now that you have the phone make/model that you want to use, you will need to get the SIP registration information from your carrier and configure each phone with those settings.  You will need to get this information from tech support (unless they have some FAQ online that has this information).  Typically, if you had ordered the phones through your carrier, the phones would have been pre-configured and registered to your cloud PBX.  It would have been plug and play as the installation tech communicated to you.  Since you told your sales rep that you wanted to use your own phones, you will need to configure your phones with the correct SIP registration settings.  Those SIP settings would be the username, password, SIP Server address, SIP registration port, backup SIP server if applicable, proxy server and port if applicable.  Most VoIP carriers will push their own configs to the phones once it has successfully registered with the PBX, but the important thing is to get your phones provisioned and registered to the cloud PBX.\n\n- In the admin portal you will need to create your users, build your extensions, assign your users to the devices/phones, create your ring group(s), create your auto attendant, and route calls to your phone numbers accordingly.  Your carrier should have \"how to\" guides on how to accomplish this.\n\n- Since you are up shits creek with no service because you don't have any phones working, you should check with tech support to see if there is a sof",

In 2024???), and I have to constantly reinstall it when I switch from desktop to laptop.\n\nSo, after a few weeks of fighting with it I just save everything to dropbox first and then drag it over to clio. If I need to email someone a PDF from my phone, dropbox makes it possible. Whatever. It's their money and I'm a team player.\n\nAs for a receptionist, I don't see the need. The clients and realtors get my cell. On the extremely rare occasions that a client abuses this privilege, caller ID saves the day and I just decline the calls, close the deal, and never work with that client again.\n\nIf those systems help you make more money than they cost you, though, more power to you.

You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick.

    "text": "Okay so I\u2019ve read the responses posted by other attorneys who have had \u201cbad experiences\u201d with legalmatch and I would like to share my story.\n\nI\u2019m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.\n\nWithin the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn\u2019t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.\n\n6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person. I was finally comfortable spending 4k a month on a PI membership and the 1,400 on my criminal membership but my key account person got me a better deal I got the combo membership for only 4,600/month. The criminal clients are paying for this membership and then some. On the PI membership some of the clients are very good a lot are trash, but, the day a case came in involving a Walmart truck that killed someone I jumped on it and I settled for 7.5 million from that case. Now I\u2019m taking PI statewide and Criminal only in the metropolitan I live in.\n\nAnyone who says this didn\u2019t work for them. It\u2019s because they didn\u2019t work the program. I have notifications on for my mobile app, my secretary is logged in on her phone and computer and I get emails. The two of us click on every new case as soon as it gets on and she\u2019s trained to know a good vs a bad client and we respond right away. Either she\u2019s calling to set up a consult or I\u2019m calling to begin the consult and get them into the firm. The only time I\u2019ve ever missed out on a client I was on vacation and my receptionist\u2019s phone died. With there being a limited number of attorneys in each group this is unlike any other lead service, and I\u2019ve used a lot of them.\n\nYou can listen to me or the losers just know I\u2019m living much more comfortably now. I will always swear by legalmatch.",

    "text": "You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. \n\nSince your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.",

    "text": "I left the public defenders office to join a family law firm and started a criminal defense practice for that family law firm. I later left that firm and joined a larger firm and continued to do criminal defense and family law. I made most of my money from family law, but enjoyed the criminal law practice 1000% more. For years I tried to ditch family law and do more criminal defense work. I was not successful. Partly because I kept taking on big complex family law cases, but partly because I was known as a family law lawyer and that's what people referred my way. \n\n  \nFamily law burned me out. I was only able to fully quit it by moving to another jurisdiction and joining a firm doing completely different work. \n\n  \nMy family law clients were very needy. They require a lot of staff support. My criminal defense clients were usually not very needy and I barely needed staff to handle them. (Don't get me wrong staff was important, but it was possible to handle my criminal law files without staff if necessary. Family law without staff may be possible for stronger lawyers than I, but I don't recommend it.) \n\n  \nFrom a financial standpoint, your plan makes sense. From a mental health stand point, I strongly recommend against it. If you expand to family law, you will need a good receptionist and a good paralegal. Someone that can calm the clients down when you aren't available, and someone to work up the files for you while you are in court.  \n\n  \nI found that learning family law was not that difficult. That was true in my jurisdiction partly because the judges largely ignored the rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, caselaw, etc. Family law was where the rules meant nothing. The \"trials\" were not enjoyable like criminal trials. No jury. Usually just the other side, maybe a couple of other small witnesses. Your trial advocacy skills won't get used much. \n\n  \nThe hardest part to learn, beyond dealing with the clients, was calculating child support and alimony/maintenance/spousal support. That and learning how to read a tax return. Befriend a CPA and pay them to help you understand a tax return if that isn't something you are familiar with. \n\n  \nBut ultimately, don't do it. If you can make a decent living doing criminal defense, you'll be a lot happier.",

    "text": "Not a lawyer, but I\u2019ve used them a bunch over the years, both personally and for our businesses.\n\nIn 2018 I was sued over lease hold agreement. This was the landlord for commercial building that my business was renting and leased for several years. He was suing us because he changed the terms of the lease about two years into attend your lease he did not ask he did not offer: he demanded and proclaimed that they were changing and we had no choice.  \n\nThe attorney I was using at that time was in her third year with a local firm. At one point about two months after the first service, something happened at the Law Firm and the next time I called to talk to her the receptionist or secretary sent me to a different attorney who told me that he was taking over the case because she was no longer with that firm. I asked him if her departure had anything to do with any of our current work, to which he replied no. \n\nOnce we started talking about the next response, it was obvious that not only had he not read the case file, he incorrectly summarized what he had read, and wasn\u2019t at all interested in listening. \n\nOnce I hung up with him, I called my former attorneys cell phone, and asked her how she th was doing. We spoke for about 10 minutes, and at that time, she was very adroit at never even implying or allowing inference through omission that there was anything untoward at her former firm.\n\nBefore the call, I told her that I wasn\u2019t entirely certain about my comfort with the new council, but I wasn\u2019t sure about the ethics, and politics,\u2026 We are a rather small town\u2026 surrounding whether she might be able to take up my case again. \n\nThat night, one of our friends who has a relative who works at the old Law Firm said that not only was our attorney gone, but one of the senior partners was gone, and there had been a  settlement with my attorney having to do with something \u201cnot right\u201d happening between the senior partner and her. \n\nTLDR: IANAL but I will definitely follow any attorney I\u2019m working with -who I trust - if they leave a firm while they\u2019re working on one of my cases.  \n\nPreempt: I\u2019ve never initiated a lawsuit, although I have counter-sued. most of the words that I have for attorneys is contractual and or mineral rights associated.",

    "text": "**Answering Your Question:**\n\nBe optimisic. It's hard to tell over text, but I feel like the tone you're asking the question in is a frustrated one. High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.\n\nSome of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:\n\n* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.\n* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.\n* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level. This is normal and required an atitidue adjustment on my part to get the most out of my internship. Understand you're not being treated poorly, the things they're trying to teach you are likely just very different from anything you've ever worked with.\n\nI'd also like to clarify that the I began work for the firm I am with now while I was in high school, so I understand your position. In my direct experience, you have to get your foot in the door doing absolute grunt work and then go from there. Through an ICE program, I was the morning receptionist at out main location for about 6 months until they could hire someone full-time. It wasn't until that point that I was given a position I actually enjoyed. \n\nNow a year later, I'm about to start college and the dynamic I have with the firm is beggining to change. It just takes time.\n\n\n\n**Some general advice for starting a career before you have an undergrad degree:**\n\nOnce you have your foot in the door, set yourself apart. I took tons of side-projects while also doing reception work, typically on the bussiness management side, and our managing partner started to lean on me to deal with some of the administrative things he didn't enjoy. \n\nWith resumes, I also recommend you follow the guides listed by top universities. I did tons of unpaid work on political campaigns before this position, which wasn't fun but beefed up my resume and gave me real-world experience. When creating my resume, I based it off the placement office resources at Indiana University, Harvard University, and MIT. Your resume should absolutely be a single page. I'd be happy to send you mine if you do want a reference. Timing is also important. Push your resume to as many firms as you can.",

Not the glamorous side of the job, but actually try to see under the hood. Maybe even take a part time gig as a receptionist or assistant at a small law firm for a few months on your non-nursing days. I think you will be surprised at what you find.

    "text": "This is tricky but I can share some industry standards.\n\nFor my clients I recommend considering 70% \u201cat capacity\u201c If you have fewer than ten employees. (Contractors don\u2019t count because they aren\u2019t fixed costs). \n\nThat\u2019s about 30 hours a week per billable employee. \n\nThis is not just to allow work that isn\u2018t billable, it\u2019s to put some slack in your schedule to better respond to clients and opportunities. its hard to respond if you are at 100% utilization. \n\nNow not all employees are billable. For example, a receptionist or bookkeeper, CFO, etc. \n\nThat gives you your rough ceiling. If the founder only spends half their time on billable work, you account for that (15 hrs a week). \n\nSo 6 hours a day for production people is \u201cat capacity\u201d 4.85 is low. \n\nAnother issue is timekeeping. Time keeping will always lag behind ACTUAL TIME spent on billable work because people forget to enter time for small things - multiply that five minute email here and that 15 min internal client discussion X ten people = a lot of \u201clost\u201d time. \n\nYou are over staffed. One of the biggest and most expensive mistakes I made was not cutting staff fast enough. We would work on elaborate internal projects - great work but bad practice. \n\nDrive more billable hours or cut 1-2 people.",

I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:\n\n1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my \"finalist\" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer \"office\" over \"firm\".\n\n2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my \"finalist\" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, \"first.lastinjurylawoffice.com\" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. \n\n3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. \n\n4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. \"Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert.\" If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. \n\n5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. \n\n6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free\n\n7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) \n\n8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. \n\n9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. \n\n10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. \n\n11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. \n\n12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.",

Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.\n5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc \n6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority \n7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got some clients going and you want more or you\u2019ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there\u2019s advanced marketing strategies I\u2019d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. \n\nI\u2019m excited for you. I hope it goes well! \n\nIf you\u2019re got more questions feel free to ask.",

It seems the rules of this sub say that I can\u2019t recommend products or services so I guess that\u2019s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There\u2019s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!",

    "text": "Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.\n\nFrom what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.\n\nA few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.\n\nOne thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.\n\nThe intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.\n\nGood luck with the new practice!",

A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.

Kind of lost me there.\n\nAnyways, there are a couple ways i\u2019ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.\n\n1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day\u2014absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.\n\n2. GHL dudes cold-calling\u2014These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They\u2019re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. \n\n3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. \n\nLastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. \n\nAlso, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.",

I knew a few of my big cases would pop this year and since September I have made $350k+ before taxes which is more than I have ever made- so I have some money to spend on assistance and help.  \n(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  \n\n\n(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.\n\nRandom Story:\n\nI love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a \"steak knife salesman\" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.",

Since going solo I have expanded a bit into criminal and some admin stuff that I've dabbled in before but never had the time.\n\n1. Malpractice Insurance - get a few quotes, should be 1000-1500/year  \n2. Laptop/Printer (I got a 400 dollar one with a scanner/fax that is not set up lol)  \n3. Website - I built my own in SquareSpace. I signed up for Canva free trial and used that to create firm logo and \"branding package\" aka the colors and fonts to use for consistency.   \n4. Stack. I use Office 365, Adobe, QuickBooks, Zoom phone number. The Zoom number routes to my MIL who will serve as a receptionist (calls are intermittent) I will eventually pick up a case management software but I only have a few files and have a file structure in OneDrive that mimics the file structure of the large case management system I used at my last job.  \n5. A private mailbox down the street for business mail.   \n6. A meager marketing budget (think business cards, joining a local marketing group, sponsoring local group sports teams/etc). I wouldn't bother with google ads or anything. I spent 1k on google ads and the calls were utter trash. Instead the organic marketing has brought me crazy referrals.\n\nI have a virtual office so I spent a few hundred dollars revamping my home office and passed on formal office space. If a client wants to meet, many of them are not near me/where my office would be so they do not want to meet anyway. Lots of library rooms reserved, coffee shops, things like that. \n\nI've only been a solo for 10 weeks but in Feb I made what I made last February and in March I will have made 1.75x my previously monthly salary, and am arguably only \"working\" part time right now.",

After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.\n\nThey couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.\n\nI wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.\n\nI went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.",

They don\u2019t tell you that up front.\n\nI started small, thinking I\u2019d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you\u2019re on enterprise. Unless you\u2019re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.\n\nTheir \u201ctech support\u201d takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it\u2019s not with a solution, but with another question\u2014like they didn\u2019t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.\n\nThey kept charging me, claiming I didn\u2019t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.\n\nNo phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don\u2019t waste your time or money here.\n\nSynthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they\u2019ll vanish.\n\n---",

This was crucial for my business, as I intended to offer this service under my own brand to my clients.\u200b\n\nHowever, upon implementation, I encountered several issues:\n\nPersistent Synthflow Branding: Despite assurances, Synthflow's logos and branding remained visible throughout the platform, including on client-facing interfaces.\u200b\n\nSupport Tickets Redirected to Synthflow: When potential clients submitted support tickets through what was supposed to be my branded platform, they were directed to Synthflow's support channels, undermining the white-label experience.\u200b\n\nLack of Responsive Support: I reached out to Synthflow's support team multiple times to address these concerns. Unfortunately, their responses were unhelpful, and the issues remained unresolved.\u200b\n\nThis experience not only affected my business's credibility but also raised concerns about Synthflow's commitment to their white-label partners. The presence of their branding on my platform confused clients and suggested a direct relationship with Synthflow, which was not the case.\u200b\n\nI advise others considering Synthflow's white-label services to proceed with caution. Ensure you thoroughly test the platform and confirm that all branding can be appropriately customized or removed before making a commitment.\u200b",

In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages.

I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company.

That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.",

During the sale, we were told we wouldn\u2019t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.\n\nThe dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.\n\nThe HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.\n\nThe RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.\n\nUltimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. \n\nIt is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says \u201cthe service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable\u201d and \u201cnever should a client experience what you have\u201d yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge.

We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.

No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. \n\nTo be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. \n\nAt no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when \"copying and pasting\" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]\n\nThis whole \u201cHelp us help you\u201d is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no \"confirmation\" that I was referred to as an \"attorney\" is just shameful.  \n\nIgnoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services.

Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request. The fact that emails went out without a greeting or signature line is not how I wish to be presented to the public. It also explains why my c",

    "text": "We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.\n\nThat's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.\n\nThis service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.\n\nWhen signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.\n\nFirst month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.\n\nI logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these \"calls\". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these \"calls\" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.\n\nAfter calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the \"calls\" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was \"only\" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank \"calls\" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.\n\nCharging full minutes for \"calls\" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.\n\nI am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing \"no response on other line\" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.\n\nAfter days of fighting over the un",

I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.",

I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable!

Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the \"phone tree\" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running.

Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told \"I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this\u201d.\n\nWe finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: \u201cI do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs\u201d. \n\nWe did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.\n\nAnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)!

I actually hung up on them after I found that they do not have a company ban on clinics that provide rebirth or attachment therapy, and actually the lead person that contacted me was not even aware of what that was. Even though this is illegal in two states, Colorado and North Carolina. \n\nI explained that this company ban will impact how they do business with hospitals because many medical providers work in multiple facilities and also refer their clients to other providers in the network. It is nearly impossible to NOT affiliate yourself with a licensed provider rendering this service in a state where it is legal, you may as well not operate in a state where this is legal if that is the case. \n\nIf trust pilot needs copies of my phone records to prove that this review is for THIS COMPANY PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU MY PHONE RECORDS and EMAILS FROM SALES. \n\nAccording to the lead team, the agents while flag calls for keywords, even if they are not regarding self harm, suicidal thoughts or intentions to harm others. Simply inquiring about services that are legal in your state will be enough for your account to be closed or \u201chandled\u201d even if you are operating within the mandated licenseing guidelines and state policies. \n\nThe \u201cglobal\u201d emphasis was then lost once I pointed out international differences in policy and schedules of drugs. To sum this up, this is purely a subjective decision that impacts a very large demographic.\n\nI was interested in working with them and the service sounded like exactly what I needed. However, after sitting through several calls, I was told that they do not service ANYONE or ANYTHING to do with MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

When I asked if I could speak to someone outside of sales regarding this policy for clarification, I was told that there is no one else and that I was going to be told the same thing. \n\nSo please understand, I was told that your calls will be screened and flagged for keywords, then cancelled.\n\nResponse to their response: \nWe have several lines that could have been utilized for this service, our company was outright told no. We didn\u2019t need your services to answer calls for that particular examination. We were not even able to explore options to work around it. Such as, your agents simply telling the client that they don\u2019t handle they do not schedule for those calls. Or just using another number all together that doesn\u2019t forward to you. \n\nWe were told flat out that you \u201cDO NOT WORK WITH ANYONE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT SERVICE OR EVEN ASSOCIATES WITH THAT\u201d Even if they are not providing the services themselves, they could simply just be in collaboration with an entity. \n\nWe",

Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).

So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.

Despite asking a very simple question, I received no helpful answers. Instead, the ruby's live chat agent repeatedly asked the same questions, clearly not paying attention to my responses. This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.\n\nThe agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs? Given the high price they charge, I expected much better. Sadly, their service falls far below even the most basic standards. I would not recommend Ruby Live Receptionist to anyone looking for reliable and respectful service.",

    "text": "For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.\n\nRuby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.\n\nFirst, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  \n\nI would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It\u2019s horrific. You can't get anyone from their \u201chappiness team\u201d on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  \n\nTheir reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their \"blame the customer\" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.",

As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.\n\nRuby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.\n\nEven then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. \n\nThe very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.\n\nFrustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another \"Urgent\" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.\n\nTo add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.\n\nI tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.\n\nIf you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save you",

    "text": "Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.",

She called in sick one day, and said that the power was out several days so that she couldn't work.  After 2 weeks I contacted V**** again and said that this assistant also could not follow directions, was taking time off and then not making up for it, and I wanted the 2 months refunded.\n\nV**** has written me back once, saying no refunds.  I have followed up multiple times complaining that they billed me for 2 months where my assistant was not doing anything - they did not care.  They did nothing to remedy it.  I have not heard back from anyone else, so I'm now resorting to telling everyone that I can -\n\nDO NOT HIRE AN ASSISTANT FROM WING.\n\n(This was originally posted on May 9, 2024, then Wing got my review removed by stating that I'm not allowed to name a person's name.  So now I've edited my original complaint, only removing the manager's name, and reposted on Dec 5, 2025)",

    "text": "I run three companies and signed up for Wing because I needed a highly capable virtual assistant to manage day-to-day client and staff communications in Washington and take admin work off my plate. Wing upsold me to their $1,500/month \u201cpremium\u201d VA plan and promised not only a qualified assistant but also a \u201ccustomer success manager\u201d supervising them.\n\nThe reality: I spent three weeks rewriting almost every email and text my Wing VA sent. I even had to step in personally to phone contractors and customers because the VA could not handle basic customer service or staff management. The VA was clearly underqualified and unskilled\u2014nothing like what Wing advertised. Their so-called \u201ccustomer success manager\u201d was non-existent in practice; no proactive support, no supervision, and certainly no accountability.\n\nWhen I finally cancelled and asked for my money back, I learned Wing offers no guarantee. You\u2019re simply out the money, no matter how bad the service.\n\nSince leaving Wing, I\u2019ve hired a new VA on my own. I gave her the exact same SOPs I\u2019d given Wing\u2014and within days she was flawlessly running my company with hardly any input from me. That is what I thought Wing would deliver.\n\nIf you\u2019re a busy business owner looking for a vetted, high-level assistant and hands-on support, my experience shows Wing does not stand behind its promises.",

When I finally got a response, they admitted to \u201can unexpected setback that affected [their] ability to meet the initial SLA timeline.\u201d\n\nDespite that, they refused to refund the deposit, claiming that \u201cas outlined in the contract you signed, the deposit is non-refundable, particularly in cases where we\u2019ve already provided candidates for your role.\u201d However, no qualified candidate was actually provided, and communication was virtually nonexistent during that time.\n\nThey did offer to apply the deposit \u201cas a credit toward your next hire,\u201d but after this experience, I have no interest in working with them again. The lack of accountability, poor communication, and refusal to make things right makes this a service I cannot recommend.",

    "text": "AVOID AT ALL COSTS\nFirst, they do not pay their assistants well, see testimony on reddit. \nI've just tried working with them for 5 months and I have mixed feedback: when I started they upsold me to a MID level VA, my digital VA was super nice and hard working but didn't have all the skills to deliver on their promises. I gave them some time to improve and started to feedback to the customer success manager, they promised more trainings, after waiting I realised no more trainings were coming and eventually the customer success manager started pitching me another company they knew and worked for on the side. I cancelled the contract. When I contacted the leadership on Linkedin and email to share my feedback, they were unresponsive, try to spin it my patience against me and finally hide behind their T&Cs. All while sending automated emails about how they have made changes and are better now. I wish I had had a better experience as the begining was great but it ended up terribly. Unfortunately it seems to be the experience of a lot of recent reviews.",
