### 1. ? — 2025-01-23 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Goodcall**

**Pain point:** AI receptionist for businesses starts with upsell options instead of helping; no real interaction, just constant sales pitch; can't resolve actual problems.

> When I call a customer service number, I expect a number of options to eventually get to a person to deal with the problem. Goodcall starts immediately with upsell options to service I don't want or need. There is no interaction, just a constant sales pitch. If you have the patience, you will be told they can't help with the problem and provide another number to go through the exact same process again. I sincerely hope the businesses using Goodcall quickly go broke.
