**Pain point:** Pest control business owner impressed that AI voice assistant sounds realistic; customers are shocked it is AI, and spam filtering plus instant email delivery of messages is a key benefit.
*User type: business_owner*

> I hired Smith Ai to assist me with handling calls for my pest control business. I started with the AI voice assistant option before going straight to the live agent plan. I was impressed at how real the AI rep sounded and so have my customers so far. I have received nothing but compliments so far and the callers have been shocked that its really Ai vs a live message and how quick I returned their call. Smith delivers the message immediately after the call ends via email. Another plus is how they can filter and block spam calls! The dashboard allows me to view, mark and block calls too. So far so good!

### 2. ? — 2025-12-30 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **My AI Front Desk**

**Pain point:** Brokerage was nervous about AI handling calls where deals start, but gradually transitioned from after-hours to all calls; AI freed team for higher-value work, improved follow-ups, and accelerated growth.
*User type: business_owner*

> We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.

We started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.

What surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.

Since making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.

Since then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.

We would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.

*User type: business_owner*

> Our company has been utilizing an answering service since 2010 which has transformed the way we do business. I am SO happy to have found Abby Connect. They are hands down the best answering service I have ever worked with. My account manager Angie is always there to update any last minute changes whether it be for holiday hours or unexpected staff absences. She always gets back to me in a timely manner and makes sure all of our calls are answered professionally. Many of our clients are shocked to find out they even spoke to an answering service because of how well they answer our clients calls and questions. We couldn't imagine doing business without their assistance. They are truly part of our team and help us provide great service to our clients.

### 5. r/VOIP — 2024-09-10 | 7pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY

**Pain point:** Answering service owner argues IVR is terrible for first-time callers seeking high-dollar services; the industry is littered with terrible cheap answering services that lose leads
*User type: vendor*

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

*User type: business_owner*

> I used [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) - they were fine, but very new when I used them (2014-2015 I think). The main issue is that the receptionists were work from home, so call quality and background noise.

Then I used Gabbyville - they were good too, and I don't really remember why I left.

Finally, I used Ruby.  I highly, highly recommend. They were a bit more expensive, but well worth the cost. Plus they really tried to be one of the team (at least twice I said direct my calls to voicemail because I was ill, and they would send me a care package).

Previously, many calls were missed or people would not leave voicemails, and we were missing out on a lot of potential leads.

Their friendly, professional receptionists ensure that every client call is answered promptly and warmly, no more missed opportunities or voicemails piling up. As a solo practitioner, having Ruby handle client intake, appointment scheduling, and basic FAQs has freed up valuable time for me to focus on casework. The service is reliable, easy to integrate with my practice management tools, and gives my firm the polished, responsive feel of a much larger operation. Highly recommended for solo attorneys looking to elevate client experience and streamline operations.

*User type: business_owner*

> I was blown away by the lengthy, articulate and expansively descriptive email response Ruby sent me regarding assessment of the intake calls process.  Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn’t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors. Thank you again Ruby for the winner mentality, look forward to taking your good service to great and even better!

**Pain point:** Law firm finds Smith.ai's AI receptionist is not a favorite of clients but does an adequate job capturing data; pricing feels high vs quality, and it needs better handling of court calls.
*User type: business_owner*

> Reasonable service for price. To be clear the AI isn't the favorite of our clients. However, it does an adequate job of capturing data from callers and forwarding them to the correct person. At this time it's an ok fit for law firms but could be better. Improvements include specifically allowing for better instructions for the AI to immediately forward court calls to the relevant attorney. The pricing on this is a little high vs. the quality of the AI but not overly high. Smith AI compensates me for this review.

*User type: business_owner*

> Overall it's a valuable asset to my business, however in 4 out of 10 messages you take you misspell the email address, telephone number or name. This has to be improved.

You should also add a lower rate tier for companies like mine where very few incoming phone calls are to be answered. I feel we are paying too much.

All that said, it's great to have 24/7 phone answering service.

### 14. ? — 2022-12-24 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist ignored explicit instructions from business owner to screen a wrong-number call, wasting time and money during a busy event.
*User type: business_owner*

> My recent engagements with Ruby Customer Service weren't what I expected. I was pretty much challenged by the representative regarding instructions I gave to the receptionist regarding someone calling inbound for the 'wrong company.' The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them. So sad that this situation could have ended differently if only the receptionist valued my words more than the callers.

### 15. r/LawFirm — 2024-11-22 | 5pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Consultant recommends Smith.ai or Ruby Reception for call answering as part of ideal small firm tech stack, alongside Lawmatics for intake automation
*User type: consultant*

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

Gabrielle went above and beyond at every step, incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and proactive. She understood exactly what we were trying to achieve and made sure every detail was handled correctly. Her communication was outstanding, her follow-through was flawless, and she made what could have been a complicated process feel smooth and effortless.

### 28. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-11 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **RingCentral**

**Pain point:** Solo lawyer pays ~$100/month for a live remote receptionist during working hours on top of RingCentral, having evolved through multiple phone setups over decades to simplify operations.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

> Receptionist - overseas remote worker. All calls with OC/clients needs to be scheduled (we use zoom for phones). I don't drop what I'm doing to answer calls (unless there's an emergency).

If the call is from a potential new client, reception routes to Intake, another overseas position.

If new client is qualified, Intake schedules call with salesperson. We use Clio Grow for new clients, but it sucks and I wouldn't recommend it.

Via Clio Grow, new client gets series of emails reminding of appointment, letting them know what to expect ect.

Salesperson uses clio grow to draft template agreement. Clio manage captures payment.

Case is converted to Clio manager where we open template file.

I use notion to outline, step by step, sometimes in painful detail, who does what when for every time of project we might be working on (okay, not every project, I'm still working on it).

Every month, legal team uses chatGPT to send client monthly email update. This is as much for me as the team -- I compare month over month to see if case is moving forward.

Case ends with formal closing procedures.

  
OP, the actual software you use does not matter. That's the least important part. Attorneys will argue forever about what software is "best." The reality is that they are all a shit sandwich. You just need to decide which shit sandwich tastes less shitty than the rest.

The KEY to running a successful, well-run, profitbale business is having SYSTEMS in place and holding the team accountable to those systems. You can write the systems on a napkin and copy them for the team. It doesn't matter. It just needs to be written down and you need to hold the team accountable to those systems you design.

### 30. r/LawFirm — 2024-03-14 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **LEX Reception**

**Pain point:** Family lawyer uses LEX Reception for intake but is not a massive fan and plans to move away from them.
*User type: business_owner*

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu
