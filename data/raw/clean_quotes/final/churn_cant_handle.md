### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-23 | 3pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Both Alert and Smith.ai answering services are poor because random uninvested people answer calls; only suitable as overflow, not for practice areas that need to sign clients over the phone.
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve tried Alert and Smith.ai. Both suck, but Smith sucks less. It’s expensive for the industry however. 

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone. 

If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

### 2. ? — 2024-02-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect receptionists don't listen to callers, repeatedly schedule wrong time zones, and can only work off scripts without caller context, causing more work correcting errors than if calls were self-answered.
*User type: business_owner*

> It didn't work as we envisioned. There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:

Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. 

Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.

We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

### 3. ? — 2019-07-27 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents sound mechanized and don't engage callers; they fail to follow scripts, misroute calls, and drop callers after long holds.
*User type: business_owner*

> When the Agents answer the call, they are not ‘engaging’ with the caller.  The Agents sound very mechanized.  So its a give away this is an answering service.
Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls:
Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message.
Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.

I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

### 4. ? — 2016-06-08 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents read from a screen like robots, don't understand the business, refuse calls, and sound unfriendly -- they need dedicated people per company instead of a shared pool.
*User type: business_owner*

> So I was happy with them for a little while until they started turning business away.  They clearly have robots working there that just read from a screen.  They need to have dedicated people to answer for each company because they simply do not understand what my company did or does and they still refused calls and also did not sound very friendly or accommodating to my clients.

### 5. ? — 2016-06-08 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

*User type: business_owner*

> Just got an email of a message to call a customer from 05/23/16.  We called him as soon as we got it and he had signed up with a competitor.  That can not happen.

### 6. ? — 2015-12-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents can't access basic business info, miss appointments due to errors, calls disappear from the portal, and call recordings must be requested one-by-one with no self-service access.
*User type: business_owner*

> So far, I have experienced fewer problems with AC than I did with one of their competitors. Their service gets the job done, most of the time. They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.

Inexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.

I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

### 7. ? — 2025-08-31 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionists pushed callers away by being unable to answer even simple questions like 'Do you have a website?' and couldn't pronounce the company name correctly.
*User type: business_owner*

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.

If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.

Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

### 8. ? — 2015-11-12 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** System issue erased call script causing messages to be taken as if calling an answering machine; law firm lost intake calls and escalation to management took days.
*User type: business_owner*

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem" 
Disappointingly, 
Mike

### 9. ? — 2024-06-15 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** After 5 years, service deteriorated with failed callbacks costing potentially hundreds of thousands in lost revenue; company only offers $10 credits for major errors.
*User type: business_owner*

> This is now the fourth time the company fail to make a call after telling me that they will. I have lost clients and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars because of this company's negligence. They started off well about 5 years ago but now in the last year they make so many mistakes, and all they do is say oh they won't charge for this call. Will you just lost me potentially thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue and you're going to reimburse me about $10? 

As with almost every company this company has gone too big and it did not keep up with this quality at all. Stay far away you will absolutely lose clients if you sign up with this service.

### 10. ? — 2021-01-12 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Agents couldn't follow simple processes like taking international phone numbers despite 7 emails; service cut without notice mid-weekend leaving business unreachable.
*User type: business_owner*

> This is a TRUE feedback from a VERY disappointed & furious customer.

We were looking for a 24/7 answering services for our English customers who can be anywhere in the world.
We signed with this pathetic company 10 days ago
Actually writing this comment, we don't have any working phone number or chat they decided WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to cut their “service “(we are in the middle of the week end) so our potential leads cannot join us and we have to take all our weekend to find a replacement solution with anybody off. 

We took time to write a complete written process to be followed by their agents, the first 3 days we had to explain them what to do, what to not do ( even the process is easy like a 10 years old boy can understand) but they didn't follow it even after several emails & checks by calling & chatting with them they didn’t. 

An example of a recurrent  idiot problem ? their low IQ agents cannot take INTERNATIONAL phone number standard like +XX (country) (cause our customers can be from anywhere) we sent them several emails , 7 ones on this particular point, no changes , I had to speak with 2 of their managers for nothing, guess what , no changes they still took the phone numbers like everyone is from USA (without country code) and this is a example they didn’t follow our other processes either.

Yesterday, been so furious of their incompetence to not follow a single process like this I sent them "do your job this is pathetic" or we will leave 
And then we received a 'we decide to stop'
Their agents for USA after hours  are NOT in USA , they all got Arabic names and they confirm with me (as professionals they are, you can imagine the stupidity)  that they are offshore agents (which is a shame cause our first question when it was time to select the potential supplier was “are your agents based in USA 100 %” ? ) we can pay for this no problem, answer YES : false 

So if you want your customers to not be able to join you or get complete stupid answers to their query by chat or even better receive phone number from potential leads than you cannot reach (without country code), this is the  perfect solution for bankrupt . 

we are still searching today a replacement , so it is now 3 days without phone numbers, We asked them to give a 5 days notice allows us to find an other provider > no answers and yesterday they charged us 149 USD for the chat, we asked for refund > no answers  

AVOID at all cost : a pure NIGHTMARE, those people are CLOWS

### 11. ? — 2025-01-28 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Receptionist was rude and unprofessional to a caller, resulting in a 1-star review for the law firm; possible racial bias; company refused to remove agent from rotation.
*User type: business_owner*

> Hi, I have a law firm with 228 five star reviews. We use Answer Connect. Recently I received a one-star review from a potential client who stated that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. This is our first one star review ever. I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.

### 12. ? — 2024-09-27 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Cosmetic surgery clinic's agents were unprofessional and couldn't handle sensitive medical calls; not bilingual as promised; recordings prove poor quality.
*User type: business_owner*

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable! This is far from over.

### 13. ? — 2022-06-13 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Six months of incomplete, misspelled messages; 70-80% of messages are incomplete or spam; $350/month for useless service; recommends hiring a real receptionist instead.
*User type: business_owner*

> I run a tax and accounting business.  I have used this service for 6 months - SIX MONTHS - to no success.  They have, literally, cost me 30% of my business because they can't take a message that is complete, understandable and returnable.  I have provided scripts and check sheets and 70-80% of what I get in the way of messages is incomplete, misspelled and/or a sales/spam calls or hangup!  For this totally useless service they charge me $350 per month!  It's not worth it.  Save your money and hire a receptionist.

### 14. ? — 2022-02-25 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Scripting team couldn't understand financial business; agents were unprofessional and didn't follow scripts; 31 test calls all failed; $375 wasted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins). 

After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.

We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”. 

We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.

AnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)! They clearly do not value customers and seem more interested in collecting the names and numbers of all of your customers.

Ultimately it seems that unless you are firm who just takes simple phone appointments etc., BEWARE as AnswerConnect could really damage your business reputation.

Super upset with the whole experience.

### 15. ? — 2024-01-26 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Ruby's quality nosedived post-2023 after CEO ouster, class action settlement, and system change; every call mishandled; receptionists can't follow basic scripts.
*User type: business_owner*

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.

Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.

First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  

I would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It’s horrific. You can't get anyone from their “happiness team” on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  

Their reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their "blame the customer" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.

### 16. ? — 2023-07-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm receptionists failed to follow script, gave incorrect info to leads, lost prospective clients; no response to urgent emails; cost firm revenue.
*User type: business_owner*

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.

Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.

Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. 

The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.

Frustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another "Urgent" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.

To add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.

I tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.

If you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save you

### 17. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-09 | 3pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Conversational**

**Pain point:** Answering service agents don't follow scripts, have a quality ceiling, and lack business knowledge; recommends a dedicated remote receptionist over any agency for better outcomes.
*User type: business_owner*

> I've used conversational answering service for years. It's much better than when I started with nobody but they do have a ceiling. This service does not follow a script. They will do bookings for you but combined with them not following a script it makes quality control on the bookings difficult as they are operating without solid guardrails of what your criteria are. If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

### 18. ? — 2015-12-17 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents mostly just take messages and say 'call back' instead of answering basic questions like hours and location; considering switching to another service.
*User type: business_owner*

> I'll admit, not answering all the incoming calls is nice. However, more times than not the answerconnect agent just takes a message and says "call back". Even some cases where information that is given to each agent was not passed along to the incoming calling client. For instance, simple questions like what are your hours, where are you located, what time do you close. In most cases this isn't acceptable. I have enjoyed the experience of the answering service its just not delivering 100%. I will be looking into other similar services to see if its any better.

**Pain point:** Answering services have an inherent ceiling due to personnel turnover; nobody is as good as your own staff, but AnswerConnect is one of the better options available.
*User type: business_owner*

> Nobody is as good as your own staff...so if you have to outsource to an answering service, you know it's not going to be perfect. It will get you by. If you expect more than that, you're kidding yourself. AnswerConnect is probably one of the better services available, but they're not great. They have issues directly related to personnel turnover that are pretty much unavoidable and aren't likely to change no matter how hard they care or try. Would I recommend them? Sure.

*User type: business_owner*

> The operators don't always get my name right, nor my gender, nor my practice name.  I haven't tested them on anything more complex than just leaving a message for the office.  There have been times that messages showed up in my email but were not visible on the dashboard.  It mostly works ok for now, but I'm still on the hunt for a really good one.

### 21. ? — 2015-09-25 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Answering service reps lack account-specific knowledge and require constant monitoring and retraining to handle calls properly.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have been using Answerconnect for a number of years now and in my honest and humble opinion I think that they could improve significantly. I think the biggest problem is not having a group of reps specifically on your account that have a little bit of understanding on what to do or how to handle callers specifically for your business. I have gone back and forth to improve the call center's response and information gathering but it's very frustrating to have to continually monitor and do that.

*User type: business_owner*

> They have a couple of really good receptionists. They can be great if you work with one or two consistently regarding your account. But having so many receptionists, with our firm having a list of specific call handling instructions, we get a lot of errors. We gets calls forwarded to the office when a message should have been taken, and we receive messages when the call should have been forwarded. The business is a great concept, but I don't recommend it unless you just need a receptionist to answer your calls and either forward ALL of them or take a message for ALL of them. They should assign a specific number of receptionists per client or have fewer employees.

*User type: business_owner*

> I find that the receptionists are having a difficult time following my instructions about calls to put through.  I have also had occasions where I have called the happiness dept to confirm the instructions and the settings on the app (because they didnt seem aligned) and I was told twice that it was all correct, yet the receptionists were not doing things right.  I also called the happiness dept with instructions on how to handle calls while I was on vacation, and that got messed up too, and I had to call Ruby to talk about it from my vacation in St. Thomas.  Overall I am not very impressed and for the price I pay I am going to look into other options.

*User type: business_owner*

> Overall they will answer the phones and try to follow the script.  There appears to be limited live face training on each client, so your script needs to be so easy a caveman could execute on it.  In my case, I need a series of information gathering questions to be asked skillfully and in the right context in order to successfully execute and gather basic intel like name, email, and telephone.  Only the top reps can pick up on this and execite via the offline training, and the newest reps stumble and execute poorly.  Escalating for help is tough because ecveryne is "pat" and everyone is at supervisor level, who can help and change your script.

*User type: business_owner*

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.

Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off. Do your research and find the best company.

*User type: business_owner*

> This is one of the worst services I've used as a business owner.

There are CONSTANT mistakes including:

- Collecting and submitting emails incorrectly
- Submitting names incorrectly
- Not collecting required details
- Not submitting forms

In addition to the mistakes, the customer's service is extremely poor. The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.

When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service. When I tried to reach out to her to air my grievances, she basically told me it's not her problem and to deal with support.

I believe that it's a management/operations issue rather than a specific receptionist issue, which is why I've given an extra star.

**Pain point:** Good onboarding but implementation failed; had to triple-check all work; agents lacked critical thinking and made copy-paste errors; $600/month to review their work.
*User type: business_owner*

> UPDATE to 1 Start: Smith.si response's is a material misrepresentation of what transpired. My experience was after they answered calls for just 4 days. No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. 

To be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. 

At no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when "copying and pasting" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]

This whole “Help us help you” is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no "confirmation" that I was referred to as an "attorney" is just shameful.  

Ignoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services. I had to pay for a separate dedicated Spanish line. I have moved on to a service where all reps are actually bilingual and I get to try their service FREE!

Receptionists do not read instructions. There were multiple issues, such as scheduling telephone consults without offering in-person or virtual options; not accurately screening callers; Referring to me as an attorney (I am a Legal Document Assistant) which opens up my business for considerable liability.  

Follow-up emails sent to customers did not have a salutation or signature line. To some extent, this can be viewed it's a simple oversight, but there is an expectation of reasonableness. Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request. The fact that emails went out without a greeting or signature line is not how I wish to be presented to the public. It also explains why my c

This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.

The agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs?
