### 1. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-09 | 20pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Virtual HQ**

**Pain point:** Phone answering service missed 1 in 5 calls, clients never got the same receptionist, and existing clients were grumpy being met with an answering service instead of someone who knew them
*User type: business_owner*

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

### 2. r/LawFirm — 2024-01-07 | 11pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby**

**Pain point:** Ruby used as overflow for 500 calls/month but people can still tell the difference between in-house staff and the call service, and conversions are much better with own people answering
*User type: business_owner*

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish. 

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

### 3. r/LawFirm — 2024-03-22 | 8pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Dropped Smith.ai after multiple client complaints about call quality; switched to Ruby which resolved the issue
*User type: business_owner*

> We dropped Smith.ai for the same reason. The first few client complaints I ignored because I thought “clients can be tough” but after the 4th complaint I realized it was not the clients but actually Smith.ai. We moved to Ruby with no complaints so far.

### 4. ? — 2026-02-05 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Dialzara**

**Pain point:** Business tried several AI receptionist providers and entered contracts, but found products could not adapt to their needs and were more expensive; switched to Dialzara as the best option.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have met with several AI receptionist providers and even entered into a couple of contracts, but ultimately found that their products just couldn’t quite adapt to what we needed and were much more expensive on top of it. Dialzara is by far the best and most user-friendly option we’ve come across. The owner of the company did a zoom call with me and took the time to send a 20-minute follow up video specific to our account to make sure we were comfortable with making our own changes in the future.

### 5. ? — 2025-03-18 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Dialzara**

**Pain point:** Veteran real estate investor tried multiple AI receptionist services that all failed before finding one that worked; now saving over $1,000/month by cancelling previous answering service.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have been investing real estate over 35 years. I have bought around 1,000 properties in 12 different states. 
I have tried multiple A.I. agent receptionist for my real estate business and all have failed except Dialzara. Not only is the technology superior to anything else I have found but the support and CS is better than anything else I have experienced. I love it! Not to mention I am now saving over $1,000 a month by cancelling my answering service! Go ahead and sign up for Business Plus. It's the done for you white glove service that will get you up and running in no time. In fact I was live in about an hour.

### 6. ? — 2025-09-15 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Previously relied on voicemail with voice-to-text email and customers hated the menu-based system; switching to live receptionist improved communication so much they had to increase minutes twice.
*User type: business_owner*

> We are using Ruby to handle after-hours and weekend calls only. Prior to trying Ruby, we relied on the customer to leave a voicemail. These then went to a voice-to-text email. The system was less than impressive and customers hated using a menu-based system. Since switching to Ruby, our customers appreciate talking to a live person on the first ring. The operators know when to forward a priority call. We've already had to increase our minutes per month and we're maxing that out already. Our communication and outreach to the customer has been great. And the messages we receive are much more detailed than before. We're happy we made this switch.

### 7. ? — 2025-03-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Previous call center constantly said 'we can't do that'; PATLive offered customization for call handling including scheduling, forwarding, spam marking, and CRM lead entry
*User type: business_owner*

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.

I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.

Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me—PATLive won me over from Day One!

### 8. ? — 2015-09-24 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist routinely captures wrong phone numbers, addresses, and emails; customers hang up due to painful experience; would switch if an alternative existed.
*User type: business_owner*

> They are a must have for my business.  If I found someone that was not as sloppy in execution I would switch over to them.   Yesterday for example I had one customer appointment where the phone number, address, and email were all wrong.   This routinely happens.

Today, I had a customer that I had to respell their name again because it was taken wrong (this happens frequently).

Yesterday I had a customer hang up because it was too painful to get to a point that they could tell them the available times.

If I had another option with same features and benefits, I would switch.

### 9. ? — 2025-11-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Overpromised AI capabilities, couldn't deliver; found a competitor with better AI at less than half the price; charged for months of unused service during setup.
*User type: business_owner*

> If I could give this business zero stars, I would.  They made a lot of promises to get us to sign on and then could not do any of what they said they would do.  Found a different company with far better ai capabilities for less than half the price.  Smith also made me pay for multiple months of service that I didn't use - at all - while they were trying to help set up our account.  RUN, don't walk to find another solution for your business.

### 10. ? — 2025-08-12 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** AI sounds like a live human but too many kinks; lost calls during trial; dishonest cancellation policy requiring 30 days notice even after risk-free trial promise.
*User type: business_owner*

> Buyer beware.  The ai actually sound like a live human.  That’s what got my attention.  The actual humans behind them not so great.   
I quickly realized this wasn’t what we were looking for and canceled but was then contacted by Jorge, an associate at Smith Ai.  He said I could try it risk free for 30 days and suggested an onboarding call to show us how to train and use our Ai. We agreed and tried it for a couple weeks but there are just too many kinks needing worked out still.  We ended up losing too many calls.  I emailed right away to cancel again and got a reply explaining that I now needed to give them 30 days notice again and cancel again and pay for a whole additional month.  
I would be very wary, don’t trust what they tell you. Dishonest sales associates.

### 11. ? — 2023-01-04 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Script changes require days of back-and-forth; agents follow scripts robotically without common sense; decided to bring call handling in-house despite cost.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is getting frustrating
They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled.
Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back.
This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility.
Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time. 
The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in.
We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

### 12. ? — 2024-12-10 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm switched from a cheaper call center that was costing them valuable potential cases; Ruby's higher quality justified the price difference
*User type: business_owner*

> Ruby is the best vendor decision our law firm has made this year! 

When our previous call center was costing us valuable potential cases compared to the "value" pricing of their service, we took a leap of faith and signed on with Ruby. 

And Ruby has already proved the ol' adage "you get what you pay for!" Ruby agents handle calls with such professionalism and care that there are times their process even exceeds my expectations! I am beyond grateful that we made the switch! 

They are easy to work with, quick to respond, and great with communication and data gathering. They match our values of treating every call with kindness and patience. 

We are so happy to have found Ruby!

### 13. ? — 2024-04-18 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Switched from a different answering service they were completely unsatisfied with; values Jobber software integration and ability to take downtime while knowing customers are handled
*User type: business_owner*

> I had a different answering service for our business before coming to PATLive and was completely unsatisfied with them. PATLive has been so easy to work with. Our Onboarding Specialist, Matthew, has been great in getting all the information needed for our company. I love the way that PATLive operates and has been able to integrate into our Jobber software. It really gives me the downtime needed but also pease of knowing all of our customers are still being taken care of!

*User type: business_owner*

> We have tried 4 other virtual receptionist companies prior to finding PatLive and none of them provided the professional support we were looking for like PatLive has.  Their receptionists are courteous & professional, and do not waste our minutes taking too long to provide our callers with service.  I would highly recommend them.

*User type: business_owner*

> I tried another service (SAS) and while I was in their free trial period, I had such a bad experience that I switched to PATLive. I felt like my rep, Darla, cared about my business and wanted to make sure I felt like my company was in good hands. PATLive was a little more expensive, but I feel like SAS would have cost me more due to the quality of service. I highly recommend this company.

### 20. ? — 2019-06-13 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Sales promised compatibility with Google Voice but calls went to wrong places; technology integration failed; switched to competitor Conversational.
*User type: business_owner*

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.

They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.

I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.

I went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.

> Tried them and have used this company for over two years, yet they were dropping the ball all the time and we lost a lot of business and a lot of clients and time so finally left and using another service this time US based agents …so do yourself a favor and spare yourself the aggravation that we have experienced; tried working it out patiently to no avail. After we switched to a different U.S. based answering service with a U.S based representatives we have not had any issues. All calls are now handled perfectly. Wished left smith sooner than we did.

**Pain point:** Calls going unanswered after 10 rings; clueless receptionist didn't know which company she was answering for; cancelled same day.
*User type: business_owner*

> This service used to be great, now they are completely crap. I had multiple clients tell me that their phone call was never answered, so I called the number myself. 

10 rings and no answer.

I called back and got a completely clueless woman on the phone who had no idea what company she was even supposed to be answering the phone for.

I cancelled the service that day.

AVOID!

And their reply below basically says "we know that our service is terrible."

Then a bunch of lip service...

The truth of the matter is that their prices have increased significantly, and the quality of service decreased even more. 

Bottom line, this is not a company that anyone with a professional clientele can afford to have facing their customers.

*User type: business_owner*

> I was a big fan of Ruby for the 3 years I have used them, I had even referred several clients to them. I would always brag to everyone how great their customer service was. Unfortunately in the past few months there have been some changes to the company and staffing and there customer service has become horrible. I have sent several request over the past 30 days to get an item resolved which they used to handle in minutes, now you get passed around and once they are frustrated and can't get an answer for you, they just hang up on you. I spent 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get resolved and still nothing. Its very sad to watch such a great company take a nose dive, but I will no longer be using Ruby.com
