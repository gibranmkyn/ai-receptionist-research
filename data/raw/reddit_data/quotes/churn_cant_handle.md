> Yes! Using digital tools like ChatGPT, Zoom, and Docusign will put you above the majority of other estate planning attorneys. I just left a small law firm that had everyone come into their (large, posh) office to sign documents and talk to the attorneys. Soon after the firm, the owner laid off people because she couldn't handle the expenses of the firm. We attorneys can be behind other industries that have already adopted tech.. e.g. can you imagine signing real estate documents in person anymore? That's silly. But many law firms still require it. When you talk to clients of solos or small firms, ask them if they were able to talk to their attorneys over Zoom, or sign documents remotely. It's cringe-worthy to hear their answers. And so if you DO offer these services, you're already setting yourself apart from the rest.

> I work in the IT field and I can tell we feel some immediate impact of such tools; now will it replace completely humans? I doubt it. 

Think of ChatGPT that everybody is crazy about, it's indeed awesome but it's trained on data collected in the internet and often times confidently gives us wrong answers. That's because it doesn't know "everything" and it won't know, even if it's daily trained (which is not) with the latest updates in the internet. 

When I'm consulting for a client, I always need their own exclusive data to reason about. We need numbers that aren't available in the internet. We can train the Davinci model from ChatGPT to understand context data, let's say data related to our clients, however the process of gathering the data is the most arduous one, and then preparing the data so finally training the model. You still need people to navigate the client through this process because AI it's not magic.

Something else I'm afraid it's gonna happen is free content will become more rare over time, because why would people be feeding an AI service with something they're experts at for free without any authorship or recognition? 

If that will be a trend, the AI won't have new meaningful data to train its models; or worse, the free content out there generated by AI, that it's used to train itself.
