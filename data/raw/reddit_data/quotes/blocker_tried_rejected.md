> I wrote this a few months ago. Still generally true, so posting it below. But a couple of minor updates:

- feel like the customer support is regressing - maybe related to them signing up too many customers without equivalently growing their customer support team.
- they keep talking about having some kind of secret sauce behind how they choose the right llm in responding to queries, but it has been difficult getting substantial details about that. Hopefully in the near future. Related to the above point. 

-----

I agree with some of this, and disagree with some of this. I use Harvey regularly, and have done so for the last 12-ish months. I'm at a non-US firm with about 5000 people worldwide. 

AGREE
- Harvey is a wrapper. They seem to have given up on substantially "tuning" the models that they use. They just announced that they are making available Claude and Gemini (in addition to GPT) - Expanding Harvey's Model Offerings

I don't necessarily see this as a negative. My general view of LLMs is that they will become commoditised, and the value will be in the layer(s) that sit on top of the LLM - there are so many good LLMs now. 

- Harvey is expensive. We got a substantial discount in the first couple of years for getting an enterprise licence. But it'll become very expensive (I don't have the exact figure, but USD1000/seat/month sounds about right for a rack rate). So if I was running my own firm or part of a small firm, I wouldn't look at Harvey for that reason alone - there's too much competition out there, whether from foundation models or from wrapper companies. 

- A lot of Harvey is hype. They clearly have a very solid, dedicated marketing / PR team. They do interviews with the right crowd, their blogs are very polished, and their founder's public messaging always stay on point. I mean... it's Silicon Valley. 

- I have generally been unimpressed thus far with the workflows. They have just introduced a "customs workflows" feature for building my own workflows, and a "playbooks" feature for building playbooks based on existing documents. Both of these have have some promise, but I need to test them more to have a strong view either way. 

DISAGREE
- I have found Harvey useful - so I disagree with OP's general negativity about the product.

It is definitely not perfect. But a couple of comments there:

(1) It has improved massively since I first tried it in 2023. My view (that I told my firm about) at the time was that Harvey was crap, and we shouldn't get it until it improved massively. I also think when they first started out, they tried too hard at tuning (see above). 

(2) There are three main positives about Harvey that I see now. 
1 - the wrapper is straightforward, simple and easy to use - this is a very big deal for busy lawyers who don't want to deal with crap interfaces. 
2- the output is generally good. At an individual level - document summarisation, BD article preparation, short advice writing, sense checking answers, bouncing

> How do you like the virtual receptionist deal? My firm tried it a while back and it was a major fail, but we’re a small rural firm with mostly local clients so it threw people off when they called and someone answered who sounded like they were from a different region/state/country.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-07-28 | 1pts | Mentions: **Abby Connect**

> I use Google Voice as my actual phone line, and I use [Abby.com](http://Abby.com) as my virtual receptionist service. Abby is okay. 

They lied about being compatible with Google Voice  though. I had weeks and weeks of trouble with them until I gave up on having them answer my firm's Google Voice number. It just wasn't working right until I transferred my firm's main number away from Google Voice and ceded it to Abby Connect. Now I don't have the ability to call people from my firm's main number, but each individual employee at my firm as always had their own Google Voice number anyway, so it's not too big of a loss.

It's obvious that they were lying about being compatible with Google Volce to get me sign up, and they were just pretending to be surprised about all the issues that we were having. Regardless, I use them now because they do a fine job and they speak both Spanish and English.

> I'd use a BATNA type of thinking. If you don't agree to their offer, what's likely to happen? Do you walk with essentially the same payout but no noncompete? Then you have negotiation room. In the opposite extreme, do you get no severance, and you actually signed a binding noncompete when you started the job? Then you're sorta stuck.

As an alternative to trying to get an attorney consult, if free is not an option and you doubt it's worth it, I just tried and for my jurisdiction ChatGPT gave a - to the best of my knowledge - accurate answer when asked what were requires as well as usual practice severance practices for professional services professionals.

I then asked it, again with the context of my jurisdiction, what would be an appropriate adjustment for a 12 month noncompete, given 18 months job tenure, and it said "a few months" extra severance. I have no idea if that's reasonable, but you doing the same experiment with your own jurisdiction in the question you ask your favorite genAI may guide you whether it's worth paying a lawyer to explore further.

### r/agency — 2026-01-07 | 2pts

> For question 1 - copying this answer from another post:

If you're starting out I'd recommend targeting your network first. Go through and find people you know, ex-colleagues, ex-clients etc. and ask for their help. Do some favours for people in return for case studies, referrals etc. You have to be bold and it may be uncomfortable reaching back out to people, but if done properly it should get you to the first stage of revenue growth before you need to do anything else.

Partnerships have always been good to me - find companies or agencies that work with the kind of clients you're targeting, but that don't compete with you, and work out a way where you can benefit each other through referrals or doing joint-projects.

I've seen people build large successful agencies through posting on LinkedIn, but it requires a lot of time and effort to do properly, and it usually only works well when the person is naturally good at (and enjoys) self-promotion. I see a lot of people choosing LinkedIn as their lead gen channel, and it's often because they find it easy to post content rather than get out and network or speak to people. Getting out and speaking to as many people as possible will generate far more leads than posting on LinkedIn in the early days.

I'd also advise setting yourself some targets as making sure you stick to them (non-negotiable). If you want to win 1 new client you may need to send 2 proposals, to send 2 proposals you may need to soeak to 5 people, to speak to 5 people you may need to reach out to 100 people. So if you want to win 1 new client per month, make sure you reach out to 100 people every month without fail.

For question 2 - an agency is a services business which means you'll always have to hire people to deliver work. Hiring and managing people can be challenging but it's not something you can avoid doing if you want to grow an agency. Sounds like you've had a bad experience with hiring in-house so far - I'd think about why it didn't work out and learn from that experience. Were they the right person? Were they properly motiatved? Did they get the support that they needed? Ultimtately as the agency owner it's your responsibility to ensure that the people you hire are successful.
