They were scheduling appointments with customers for roof estimates without even getting the customers' home address\n6. They would put customers on hold for minutes at a time to \"talk to the team\" but never contact anyone from the team. Super weird\n7. The initial sales representative from Abby quoted us something, but during onboarding kept trying to upsell us.\n8. They charged us for overage charges when 70% of the minutes were spent on spam calls and the phone ringing. \n\nThis company is abhorrent. I would avoid it like the plague.",

My rep is Katherine Currah and she seems to think that she has the right to not cancel my account just because the thinks she is entitled to try to talk me into staying with the company before she cancels my account. I logged into my account today and my account is still active after canceling two months ago and after having the last charge refunded and telling them to cancel my account multiple times. This is the law straw. I am filing complaints with the BBB, Trust Pilot and the FTC. I am also filing a police reporting, reporting the fraud to the attorney general as well as filing a formal complaint on Katherine Curran with the company. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING WITH THIS UNETHICAL, CRIMINAL COMPANY THAT FRAUDULENTLY CHARGES YOUR CREDIT CARD.",
