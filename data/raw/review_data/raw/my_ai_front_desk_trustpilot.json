    "title": "We were skeptical about AI, but this helped us scale",
    "text": "We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.\n\nWe started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.\n\nWhat surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.\n\nSince making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.\n\nSince then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.\n\nWe would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.",
