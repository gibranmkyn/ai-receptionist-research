    "text": "---\n\n**Avoid Synthflow at All Costs \u2013 Bait and Switch Nightmare**\n\nSynthflow is the definition of a bait-and-switch scam dressed up as a \u201ctech company.\u201d They lure you in with promises of low rates and simple setup, but the truth only hits after you\u2019ve signed up: the tools you actually need are locked behind their absurdly overpriced enterprise plan. They don\u2019t tell you that up front.\n\nI started small, thinking I\u2019d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you\u2019re on enterprise. Unless you\u2019re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.\n\nTheir \u201ctech support\u201d takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it\u2019s not with a solution, but with another question\u2014like they didn\u2019t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.\n\nThey kept charging me, claiming I didn\u2019t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.\n\nNo phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don\u2019t waste your time or money here.\n\nSynthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they\u2019ll vanish.\n\n---",

    "title": "Disappointing Experience with Synthflow.ai's White-Label Service",
    "text": "I entered into an agreement with Synthflow.ai, attracted by their promise of a fully customizable white-label AI voice assistant platform. Their marketing materials and terms suggested that I would be able to rebrand the platform entirely, removing all traces of Synthflow's branding. This was crucial for my business, as I intended to offer this service under my own brand to my clients.\u200b\n\nHowever, upon implementation, I encountered several issues:\n\nPersistent Synthflow Branding: Despite assurances, Synthflow's logos and branding remained visible throughout the platform, including on client-facing interfaces.\u200b\n\nSupport Tickets Redirected to Synthflow: When potential clients submitted support tickets through what was supposed to be my branded platform, they were directed to Synthflow's support channels, undermining the white-label experience.\u200b\n\nLack of Responsive Support: I reached out to Synthflow's support team multiple times to address these concerns. Unfortunately, their responses were unhelpful, and the issues remained unresolved.\u200b\n\nThis experience not only affected my business's credibility but also raised concerns about Synthflow's commitment to their white-label partners. The presence of their branding on my platform confused clients and suggested a direct relationship with Synthflow, which was not the case.\u200b\n\nI advise others considering Synthflow's white-label services to proceed with caution. Ensure you thoroughly test the platform and confirm that all branding can be appropriately customized or removed before making a commitment.\u200b",

    "text": "I was using their Enterprise package for a few months. With Enterprise plan I had 20000 minutes monthly, but because their batch calling didn't work I couldn't use any of it. They keep posting new updates, but their basic functions don't work. For example, if you upload a list of contacts and first and last name ends in a name row. In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages. Avoid them, save your time, money and nerves. There is so many better software's out there. Extremely dissapointed!",
