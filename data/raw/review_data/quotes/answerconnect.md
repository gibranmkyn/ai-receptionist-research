**"Outstanding Support From Tracy, Ruth, and Especially Gabrielle"**

> We recently needed to set up a new sub-account and a customized script for our preferred customer support line at AnswerConnect, and the experience was exceptional from start to finish.

Tracy and Ruth were both helpful and responsive, but I want to especially recognize Gabrielle Scilley, our Client Account Manager.

Gabrielle went above and beyond at every step, incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and proactive. She understood exactly what we were trying to achieve and made sure every detail was handled correctly. Her communication was outstanding, her follow-through was flawless, and she made what could have been a complicated process feel smooth and effortless.

It’s rare these days to find support teams that combine technical competence with genuine care for the customer experience, and AnswerConnect absolutely delivered. 

Because of the professionalism and dedication of Gabrielle, Tracy, and Ruth, we now have a support setup we’re truly confident in.

Highly recommended!

**"⭐ 1 out of 5 stars"**

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars

As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.

They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

**"THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM!"**

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.

That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.

This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.

When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.

First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

I logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these "calls". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these "calls" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.

After calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the "calls" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was "only" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank "calls" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.

Charging full minutes for "calls" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.

I am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing "no response on other line" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.

After days of fighting over the unethical charges, we made it very clear we wanted to cancel. Conveniently for AnswerConnect, we had already started in the next billing cycle and had to wait, as they didn't offer a prorated fee for cancellation. Once told this, I specifically asked Bryan H. when exactly I needed to cancel by to ensure we were not billed on the next cycle. His response was:

"...the billing cycle ends on April 30, 2025. I would call us to cancel on April 29th to cancel. You need to make a phone call into Client Services as a security measure we have to confirm we have an authorized client calling to cancel the account."

I call him 4/28, a day earlier than he stated to cancel and informed him that we wanted to end service before being charged again. We were then set up to end service today, 4/30.

Today I am sent an invoice for $8.87 with NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT THE CHARGE IS FOR. At this moment, I'm still waiting on the "why" and a credit.

NEVER WOULD I EVER RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO ANYONE. And yes, I have all of the invoices and emails to show the above.

**"Rude and Unprofessional"**

> Hi, I have a law firm with 228 five star reviews. We use Answer Connect. Recently I received a one-star review from a potential client who stated that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. This is our first one star review ever. I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.

**"Answer Connect is awful"**

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable! This is far from over.

**"It didn't work as we envisioned"**

> It didn't work as we envisioned. There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:

Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. 

Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.

We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

They charged me $221 for overage charges for minutes I used that were included in my 200 minute plan. They will turn your service randomly and are 100 percent unreliable. They will promised to credit you for turning off your service and try to charge you anyway. I found a new company and since then realized how much of horrible service I received from them.

Our staff went through the training and all we requested was not done.   When we inquired why they did answer our call as instructed, we were told by Rayne that they didn't know. They are eager to collect your card and charge it but never provide the service. They use your points to do testing. We signed up for 300 minutes by day 4, 70mins was already used between 6 calls that were ours and 6 calls they had for testing. I reached and shared this observation and we were not credited back those mins. We requested for HIPAA and IVR, they charged for it but we never received those services. We had initially requested 500min before service began, they put 300 mins. That took money for the 500mins. To get my refund, no one would return emails or calls. I would discourages from using their service.

THEY CHANGED OUR BILLING AND STARTED CHARGING US DOUBLE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNLESS WE HAD CAUGHT IT, IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED. SHADY SHADY PRACTICES. THE COMPANY OWNERS ARE TERRIBLE.

They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled.
Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back.
This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility.
Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time. 
The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in.
We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

**"Awful Service -Beware"**

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins). 

After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.

We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”. 

We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.

AnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)! They clearly do not value customers and seem more interested in collecting the names and numbers of all of your customers.

Ultimately it seems that unless you are firm who just takes simple phone appointments etc., BEWARE as AnswerConnect could really damage your business reputation.

Super upset with the whole experience.

**"The do not service all areas of healthcare! Please be advised."**

> UPDATE: I have had my reviews flagged and then they called me on a three way with wellreceived to explain themselves. This didn’t end well. I actually hung up on them after I found that they do not have a company ban on clinics that provide rebirth or attachment therapy, and actually the lead person that contacted me was not even aware of what that was. Even though this is illegal in two states, Colorado and North Carolina. 

I explained that this company ban will impact how they do business with hospitals because many medical providers work in multiple facilities and also refer their clients to other providers in the network. It is nearly impossible to NOT affiliate yourself with a licensed provider rendering this service in a state where it is legal, you may as well not operate in a state where this is legal if that is the case. 

If trust pilot needs copies of my phone records to prove that this review is for THIS COMPANY PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU MY PHONE RECORDS and EMAILS FROM SALES. 

According to the lead team, the agents while flag calls for keywords, even if they are not regarding self harm, suicidal thoughts or intentions to harm others. Simply inquiring about services that are legal in your state will be enough for your account to be closed or “handled” even if you are operating within the mandated licenseing guidelines and state policies. 

The “global” emphasis was then lost once I pointed out international differences in policy and schedules of drugs. To sum this up, this is purely a subjective decision that impacts a very large demographic.

I was interested in working with them and the service sounded like exactly what I needed. However, after sitting through several calls, I was told that they do not service ANYONE or ANYTHING to do with MEDICAL MARIJUANA. Even if you are a mental health clinic and this is simply offered as an alternative solution, they will refuse to work with you. 

This also applies to all of the companies under the parent company. When I asked if I could speak to someone outside of sales regarding this policy for clarification, I was told that there is no one else and that I was going to be told the same thing. 

So please understand, I was told that your calls will be screened and flagged for keywords, then cancelled.

Response to their response: 
We have several lines that could have been utilized for this service, our company was outright told no. We didn’t need your services to answer calls for that particular examination. We were not even able to explore options to work around it. Such as, your agents simply telling the client that they don’t handle they do not schedule for those calls. Or just using another number all together that doesn’t forward to you. 

We were told flat out that you “DO NOT WORK WITH ANYONE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT SERVICE OR EVEN ASSOCIATES WITH THAT” Even if they are not providing the services themselves, they could simply just be in collaboration with an entity. 

We have a website, we have online appointment setting, we have in house staff who could service those clients, and I said they may ask, this is true for any clinic in any state where this is legal. That didn’t mean that your agents had to handle the call, they could have said “I do apologize, you’ve called the answering service for medication management and counseling services.  Due to federal guidelines, we are unable to schedule for that service. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.” but once I said that we offer that service, the entire option was shut down. I did not need help with THAT SERVICE, I needed help with the MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, simply because my providers are licensed to render that service, you can’t provide assistance with MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. 

Period. If I call the wrong department, & they are unable to assist me due to limitations, that is my fault for not following instructions.  When you guys says that we can customize our answering service to fit our needs, & have the option to do so within your limitations, you at least give the customer a chance to compromise & both parties can walk away happy. I WAS JUST TOLD NO. “I’m sorry we can’t do anything or change anything about this”

Which is 100% incorrect. You can do what is in your legal limitations for that provider, just like EVERYONE ELSE.

We’re HEALTHCARE & MENTAL HEALTH INDUSTRY. We do not SUPPORT the “CANNABIS INDUSTRY” we support the HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. The providers are not SALES PEOPLE, they are BOARD CERTIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS & MEDICAL DOCTORS with PRESCRIPTIVE AUTHORITY. Licensed by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). 

Now we are JUST “the CANNABIS INDUSTRY.” Not the MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY or HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. Even though we are not marketed as a CANNABIS CLINIC. 

Well thanks for enlightening me.

> When the Agents answer the call, they are not ‘engaging’ with the caller.  The Agents sound very mechanized.  So its a give away this is an answering service.
Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls:
Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message.
Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.

I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

They need to have dedicated people to answer for each company because they simply do not understand what my company did or does and they still refused calls and also did not sound very friendly or accommodating to my clients.

**"Could be better"**

> Just got an email of a message to call a customer from 05/23/16.  We called him as soon as we got it and he had signed up with a competitor.  That can not happen.

**"Its OK."**

> I'll admit, not answering all the incoming calls is nice. However, more times than not the answerconnect agent just takes a message and says "call back". Even some cases where information that is given to each agent was not passed along to the incoming calling client. For instance, simple questions like what are your hours, where are you located, what time do you close. In most cases this isn't acceptable. I have enjoyed the experience of the answering service its just not delivering 100%. I will be looking into other similar services to see if its any better.

**"It is what it is..."**

> Nobody is as good as your own staff...so if you have to outsource to an answering service, you know it's not going to be perfect. It will get you by. If you expect more than that, you're kidding yourself. AnswerConnect is probably one of the better services available, but they're not great. They have issues directly related to personnel turnover that are pretty much unavoidable and aren't likely to change no matter how hard they care or try. Would I recommend them? Sure.

**"AnswerConnect works, but it has some problems."**

> So far, I have experienced fewer problems with AC than I did with one of their competitors. Their service gets the job done, most of the time. They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.

Inexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.

I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

**"Dropping the ball"**

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem" 
Disappointingly,

**"It's ok."**

> The operators don't always get my name right, nor my gender, nor my practice name.  I haven't tested them on anything more complex than just leaving a message for the office.  There have been times that messages showed up in my email but were not visible on the dashboard.  It mostly works ok for now, but I'm still on the hunt for a really good one.

**"Functioning but not always accurate in a few ways."**

> Our service works, most of the time. Many times it probably works perfectly when we're not noticing it. However when it doesn't it comes to light in a big way. Callers expect people to know how to pronounce the business name and to be transferred to the right person 100% of the time. While no one is perfect that's the goal. The service is good and functioning but we don't get much satisfaction from our clients who are put through the service. It seems seem less as you review it. Not sure 100% why, it could be simply the process but that's our experience.

**"Profession and Courteous but Lacking Efficiency"**

> Everyone one at AnswerConnect is very courteous, professional and helpful. But the lack of efficiency is becoming more regular and sometimes affects our business. Since May of this year, I have had several incidents where the calls have been sent to the wrong agent and not to the person on call. Which causes the call to go unanswered and therefore affecting our business in a negative way.

**"Could Be Better"**

> I have been using Answerconnect for a number of years now and in my honest and humble opinion I think that they could improve significantly. I think the biggest problem is not having a group of reps specifically on your account that have a little bit of understanding on what to do or how to handle callers specifically for your business. I have gone back and forth to improve the call center's response and information gathering but it's very frustrating to have to continually monitor and do that.

**"Get's it right 60% of the time, this has to be improved."**

> Overall it's a valuable asset to my business, however in 4 out of 10 messages you take you misspell the email address, telephone number or name. This has to be improved.

You should also add a lower rate tier for companies like mine where very few incoming phone calls are to be answered. I feel we are paying too much.

All that said, it's great to have 24/7 phone answering service.

**"Would not recommend"**

> This company is reliable in the sense that all of our calls get answered but they are terrible at getting all of the required information or even getting it accurate.

When we have tried to work with them to get this resolved, they simply require their people to do more while on the phone with our customers and charge us more because they are a time based billing company.  And, we still have not seen an improvement on the information we receive.

**"70% ok 30% not so much"**

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.

Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off. Do your research and find the best company.

**"Great service in concept... definitely needed but sloppy execution."**

> They are a must have for my business.  If I found someone that was not as sloppy in execution I would switch over to them.   Yesterday for example I had one customer appointment where the phone number, address, and email were all wrong.   This routinely happens.

Today, I had a customer that I had to respell their name again because it was taken wrong (this happens frequently).

Yesterday I had a customer hang up because it was too painful to get to a point that they could tell them the available times.

If I had another option with same features and benefits, I would switch.
