**"Customer dis-service"**

> When I call a customer service number, I expect a number of options to eventually get to a person to deal with the problem. Goodcall starts immediately with upsell options to service I don't want or need. There is no interaction, just a constant sales pitch. If you have the patience, you will be told they can't help with the problem and provide another number to go through the exact same process again. I sincerely hope the businesses using Goodcall quickly go broke.

**"Do not use Goodcall.com as they promise…"**

> Do not use Goodcall.com as they promise new members a free account forever but now they have changed their access to the voicemail access which cannot be accessed with any ease or in my case I cannot access the callers messages after using and putting out this number on many platforms with now a useless number. Now I will to loose many callers which may have become clients. GoodCall.com is now useless and has broken their word in having a free account forever. They are asking for nearly $60 per month to now access the calls for a service that can be obtained for less than $10 a month. My communication with the company said they would charge me only after the 2nd month to get access to this number which is out on platforms for more than a year of using this number which now is destroyed by a company that has broken their word.
