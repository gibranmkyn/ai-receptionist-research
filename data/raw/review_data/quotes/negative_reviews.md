**Avoid Synthflow at All Costs – Bait and Switch Nightmare**

Synthflow is the definition of a bait-and-switch scam dressed up as a “tech company.” They lure you in with promises of low rates and simple setup, but the truth only hits after you’ve signed up: the tools you actually need are locked behind their absurdly overpriced enterprise plan. They don’t tell you that up front.

I started small, thinking I’d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you’re on enterprise. Unless you’re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.

Their “tech support” takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it’s not with a solution, but with another question—like they didn’t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.

They kept charging me, claiming I didn’t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.

No phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don’t waste your time or money here.

Synthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they’ll vanish.

### 4. Synthflow — 2025-08-10 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"No support."**

> No one is not responsible for the questions.
Even, they are not using the same answering ai for their service.
Just ask for up grading the plan.
You need to have support as well

### 5. Synthflow — 2025-05-24 | ★★☆☆☆

**"The voice is the best I've found"**

> The voice is the best I've found, unfortunately the entire rest of the platform is glitchy and doesn't work half the time, probably will try again in 6 months and see if there's any improvement.

### 6. Synthflow — 2025-04-25 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Disappointing Experience with Synthflow.ai's White-Label Service"**

> I entered into an agreement with Synthflow.ai, attracted by their promise of a fully customizable white-label AI voice assistant platform. Their marketing materials and terms suggested that I would be able to rebrand the platform entirely, removing all traces of Synthflow's branding. This was crucial for my business, as I intended to offer this service under my own brand to my clients.​

However, upon implementation, I encountered several issues:

Persistent Synthflow Branding: Despite assurances, Synthflow's logos and branding remained visible throughout the platform, including on client-facing interfaces.​

Support Tickets Redirected to Synthflow: When potential clients submitted support tickets through what was supposed to be my branded platform, they were directed to Synthflow's support channels, undermining the white-label experience.​

Lack of Responsive Support: I reached out to Synthflow's support team multiple times to address these concerns. Unfortunately, their responses were unhelpful, and the issues remained unresolved.​

This experience not only affected my business's credibility but also raised concerns about Synthflow's commitment to their white-label partners. The presence of their branding on my platform confused clients and suggested a direct relationship with Synthflow, which was not the case.​

I advise others considering Synthflow's white-label services to proceed with caution. Ensure you thoroughly test the platform and confirm that all branding can be appropriately customized or removed before making a commitment.​

**"Our bots went down over a week ago and…"**

> Our bots went down over a week ago and they will not get back to me over me trying to pay them money! No response. I will be happy to take this down if they email me back! Ironclad Law!

### 8. Synthflow — 2025-03-25 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Customer support is a complete JOKE"**

> Customer support is a complete JOKE! - I've been waiting on a solution now for four days. They are not responding. Their bot is suddenly just disconnecting calls. I've paid $450USD two weeks ago, and haven't been able to use the service, because no one will get back to me and help me solve the problem! Exceptionally frustrating. My name is Maini Homer. All I want is a response and a solution!

**"Don't Use this platform. Scamming people"**

> Don't Use this platform. They have no customer support or anything. I got charged for the free plan and even after cancelling the subscription I got charged Again. I am trying to contact them from 2 Months and NO RESPONSE from ANYWHERE. I am not even using any services and sent them a lot of emails. But NOTHING. Keep yourself out of it.

### 10. Synthflow — 2025-02-11 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Synthflow support is non existent"**

> I used Synthflow for testing purposes to compare it against other VoiceAI platforms. Their support is non existent. I sent and email and opened a support ticket and none were answered. There's no way we could go ahead, what if we had issues, how long would the response times be.

### 11. Synthflow — 2025-02-04 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Synthflow has the worst customer service…"**

> Synthflow has the worst customer support handling by far. When they update the system, they will not inform if there's a major change. I can't refer them to anyone because of this experience. Very disappointing

### 12. Synthflow — 2025-01-05 | ★☆☆☆☆

### 13. Synthflow — 2025-01-05 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS SCAM"**

> Stay far far away. Nedzo, Air Ai, or any other platform will be a better option. 

Their backed by Atlantic Labs, which we will be contacting to express our complaints, yet can't fix their platform with the millions they've received. 

0 CUSTOMER SUPPORT.
They don't answer their discord, they don't check their slack. 

Constant re-occuring issues. Can't buy phone numbers on their platform, agents barely work, site takes forever to load. On and on

### 14. Synthflow — 2024-12-12 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"don't get started on this platform"**

> don't get started on this platform. You will shoot yourself and the business. Sometimes a call would take 100 minutes because of their backed not working. You can better start looking at Thoughly

### 15. Synthflow — 2024-12-06 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"No customer support, lots of lies"**

> I was using their Enterprise package for a few months. With Enterprise plan I had 20000 minutes monthly, but because their batch calling didn't work I couldn't use any of it. They keep posting new updates, but their basic functions don't work. For example, if you upload a list of contacts and first and last name ends in a name row. In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages. Avoid them, save your time, money and nerves. There is so many better software's out there. Extremely dissapointed!

### 16. Synthflow — 2024-07-17 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"The Ai assistant seems to works great…"**

> The Ai assistant seems to works great on the surface, but its all for naught because support is non-existent and the backend protocols are super buggy. Bot fails to make calls with no explanation, webhooks dont always fire causing issues with tagging and workflows inside CRM. But the real kicker is that we subscribed to their $450/mth plan because the trial was decent and figured itd be great if we worked out the kinks with their support, but Im going on 6 days now without any response to any of my tickets (I only put in 2)... I think I'll be filing a chargeback and hiring someone to setup Vapi for us. SynthFlow seemed too good to be true and I guess that is an accurate assumption. Smh 😔

**"They told me unless I'm spending $1000…"**

> They told me unless I'm spending $1000 a month they won't provide me a technical call. It took them 2 months to tell me that, then they proceeded to be a sarcastic ass response to tell me that it's also written on their stupid website. They just fueled a strong competitor. I'll copy everything they did and make it better and cheaper. Bunch of morons can't make enough money....stay away from these greedy punks!

### 18. Synthflow — 2024-05-30 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Avoid like the  plague "**

> Definitely has potential but the company is ran by a group of individuals that have no idea how to run a business or support one. Their ai never functions properly, there is Zero support and zero fixes. Do not waste your money go with anything else, I’ve been trying to get in contact with someone for the past 2 weeks. Extremely unprofessional group of individuals that refuse to support their clients

Do not waste your time even trying to use their incomplete product with zero support, zero documentation, all you get is a half built junk system. I’m calling my bank to dispute the charges since I can’t get a hold of anyone

### 19. Synthflow — 2024-05-01 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Here is my story with Synthflow"**

> Here is my story with Synthflow. I signed up for the top text plan at 450 / month. 1 week in I request a support by chat. No reply, I email all the founders on top of Albert and Alex. They tell me they can do an online meet with me in 4 days. We do the online meet and they fix the 3 issues. Then 4 more issues pops up. API doesnt work, bot hallucinating, I spent 25K a programmer to build something around Synthflow. on top of the $450/month. I book 3 calendar meeting with Alex and Albert. Both don't show up to 3 different ocasions whilst. Sent 8 emails to everyone just to give me an estimate date for fixes or to at least reply what they are going to do. No replies to this date. Not even the decency to reply to me saying this is the date for fix or any sort of response. Just plain ignored.

Asked for a refund no reply to this date. 

Guys do yourself a favor and find another company...this is run as a joke it seems. Not even answering a client on your top tier plan is just ridiculous.

Run away if you still can

My clients are dropping on the otherhand and I spent thousands on google and facebook ads...probably lost 40k because of SF. I am looking into legal routes at the moment. Will also contact their investors and tell my story.
