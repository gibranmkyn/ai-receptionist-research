# How Much Money Are We Talking About?

22 of 154 churn quotes mention specific dollar amounts. These aren't hypothetical — these are real numbers from real invoices that made customers angry enough to write about it.

## What people are paying

The monthly costs that show up in complaints give you a sense of the price range Central AI is competing against:

- **Smith.ai at $2,800/month** — "Billing errors from day one, promised integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support." This customer was paying enterprise rates for a service that couldn't deliver basic functionality.

- **Ruby at $700/month** — Used as overflow for 500 calls/month. "People can still tell the difference between in-house staff and the call service." Seven hundred a month and callers still know.

- **Smith.ai at $600/month** — "Had to triple-check all work. Agents lacked critical thinking." Paying premium prices to do your own QA.

- **Synthflow at $450/month** — "Bot suddenly disconnects calls with no support response for four days." The AI-native price point, but with AI-native reliability problems.

- **AnswerConnect at $350/month** — "Service switched off after credit card update. Forced to buy new subscription at 3.5x the price." Got locked out of their own business number for 35 days.

- **Abby Connect at $300/month** — "Billed for spam calls and phone ringing time. $300/month for Google Calendar integration."

## What people are losing in overcharges

The billing complaints aren't vague — customers document specific amounts:

- **Smith.ai overcharged by $3,000+** over 5 months. "Upsold to a plan costing $700/month more than needed. Support was unreachable."

- **Ruby charged $1,100** for a forced 26-day cancellation period while they were already dropping the customer's calls.

- **AnswerConnect billed $360.80** against a contracted $275 — "Promised 30 free calls under 30 seconds but charged for all of them."

- **Synthflow: $25K on custom integration** plus $450/month. "API doesn't work, bot hallucinates, founders no-showed 3 meetings."

## What this means

These aren't price-sensitive customers shopping for the cheapest option. They're businesses paying $300-$2,800/month and getting burned. The switching cost of trying Central AI is low relative to the money they're already wasting.

The dollar amounts also validate the pricing opportunity: if customers are paying $700/month for Ruby and still unhappy, Central AI doesn't need to compete on price alone. It needs to compete on actually working.
