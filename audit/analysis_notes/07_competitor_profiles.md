# The Competitors: Who Are These Companies?

Before diving into who's most vulnerable, here's who we're looking at and how the market works.

## How answering services work

Many small businesses — law firms, medical offices, home service companies — can't afford a full-time receptionist. So they outsource to an answering service. A remote receptionist reads from a script, takes a message, and routes the call. The business pays per minute or per call.

This model has built-in problems. One receptionist juggles hundreds of clients. Training time per client is minimal. Staff turnover is high. Your "dedicated receptionist" is actually a stranger reading a script they saw 30 seconds ago.

## The big four (legacy, human-pool)

**Ruby Receptionist** — Founded 2003, Portland. 15,000+ customers. From $235/mo (50 min) to $1,640/mo (500 min). Positions on "warmth and personal touch." In our data: 36 churn quotes. Biggest net loser in switching data (-4). Longtime customers describe significant quality decay.

**AnswerConnect** — Founded 2002, Portland. 24/7, per-minute billing including "after-call work" time. From ~$350/mo (200 min). In our data: 36 churn quotes. Highest call handling failure rate of any competitor (69% of their churn). Customers describe agents who "read from a screen like robots."

**PATLive** — Founded 1990, Tallahassee. The oldest player. From $235/mo (75 min) to $999/mo (600 min). In our data: 28 churn quotes. Biggest net winner in switching data (+5) — not because customers love them, but because they're where people go when they give up on worse alternatives.

**Smith.ai** — Founded 2015, Palo Alto. Hybrid AI + human model, per-call billing. From $300/mo (30 calls). Also offers a pure AI plan from $95/mo. In our data: 23 churn quotes. Highest billing-driven churn (43%). Customers describe "intentionally difficult" cancellation.

## The structural problem

All four legacy competitors share the same model: shared human pool, per-minute billing, script-based, high turnover. This means:

1. Receptionists can't know every client's business (→ script failures, inauthenticity)
2. Longer calls = more revenue (→ incentive to inflate call times)
3. Constant staff churn = constant retraining (→ inconsistent quality)

Central AI's structural advantage: a dedicated AI trained on each client's business eliminates problems 1 and 3 by design. Transparent flat-rate pricing addresses problem 2.
