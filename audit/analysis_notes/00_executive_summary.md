# The Short Version

We read 409 reviews of answering services. 154 of them described exactly why a customer left. We had two independent classifiers tag every single one, and they agreed 92% of the time (kappa = 0.91 — that's "almost perfect" in stats speak).

Here's what jumped out.

**Almost 80% of churn maps to two problems: the calls themselves (45%) and billing (33%).** Both of these are problems where AI has a structural advantage over shared human pools. That's not a coincidence — it's the opportunity.

Three things you should know right now:

1. **Ruby and Smith.ai are bleeding customers.** Ruby has the worst net churn flow in our data (-4). Smith.ai is second (-2). Their customers are actively shopping. Central AI should be in front of them.

2. **The headline ratings are fake.** Before mid-2024, these companies averaged 1.2 to 3.8 stars from unprompted reviews. Then suddenly, waves of 5-star reviews appeared. The real customer experience hasn't improved — perception management has.

3. **AI-native competitors prove the concept but can't execute.** Synthflow (the only one with enough data) has 47% of its churn from billing and 35% from platform reliability. They solved call handling but introduced new problems. Central AI needs to avoid both failure modes.

**What to do:** Target Ruby and Smith.ai churners. Lead with call handling quality and transparent pricing. Start with legal — that's where the loudest signal is.
