# Are These Companies Getting Better or Worse?

If you look at Trustpilot today, AnswerConnect has a 3.7, Ruby a 3.5, PATLive a 4.0, Smith.ai a 3.8. Decent-looking numbers. But they're hiding something.

We pulled the time series — 457 Trustpilot reviews broken into half-year buckets — and a pattern jumped out that changes the story entirely.

## The pattern: terrible, terrible, terrible... then suddenly great

**AnswerConnect** averaged 1.2 stars from organic reviews between 2021 and mid-2024. Then in H2 2024, a wave of reviews pushed it to 4.5. By early 2026, it's a perfect 5.0. That's not a company that suddenly fixed everything — that's a review solicitation program.

**Smith.ai** had zero 5-star reviews on Trustpilot before mid-2024. Zero. Out of 13 reviews. Then 49 five-star reviews appeared in the next 60. The service didn't change overnight — the review strategy did.

**Ruby Receptionist** went from consistent 1.0-1.5 stars (2022-2024) to 5.0 (early 2025). Some organic 5-stars existed earlier (10 of 56), so Ruby does have a real base of satisfied customers. But the recent surge (41 of 46 reviews are 5-star) is disproportionate.

**PATLive** is the most honest chart. They had genuine 5-star reviews even in the early periods (38 of 72). Their recent ratings are also 5.0, but the pre-existing positivity makes the trend less suspicious.

## The before-and-after

| Competitor | Organic Avg (pre-2024 H2) | Recent Avg (2024 H2+) | Jump |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Smith.ai | **1.23** (13 reviews) | 4.37 (60 reviews) | +3.14 |
| AnswerConnect | **2.21** (34 reviews) | 4.42 (71 reviews) | +2.21 |
| Ruby | **2.07** (41 reviews) | 4.52 (61 reviews) | +2.45 |
| PATLive | 3.75 (69 reviews) | 5.00 (19 reviews) | +1.25 |

Smith.ai had the lowest organic rating of any competitor we tracked. **1.23 stars from unprompted reviews.** That's the real baseline.

## What about the AI competitors?

Early but interesting:

- **Dialzara**: 14 reviews, 5.00 average, 100% five-star. All since August 2024.
- **My AI Front Desk**: 8 reviews, 5.00 average, 100% five-star. Small sample, but no sign of dissatisfaction yet.

These are tiny samples — far too small for conclusions. But the contrast with legacy competitors' organic ratings is stark.

## Why this matters for Central AI

The traditional answering service market *looks* like it's improving on Trustpilot. It's not. Companies are managing their review scores while the underlying problems persist. Every complaint in our churn dataset — the script failures, the billing tricks, the quality decay — comes from the same period these companies claim to have improved.

The real customer experience is still broken. The organic data proves it. Central AI is competing against a market with artificially inflated ratings and genuinely terrible service.
