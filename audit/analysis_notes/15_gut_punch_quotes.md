# Hear the Customer

Before the charts and percentages — hear what these people actually said. One quote per churn group, selected by the combination of detail, emotion, and engagement.

### "They have wasted our ad budget, lost customers for us, and wasted hours of our time."

*— Smith.ai customer, Trustpilot*

A year-long parade of incompetence. This customer describes wasted ad spend, lost leads, and hours spent trying to fix problems. The kicker: they're still a customer. Real switching costs — porting numbers, retraining workflows — keep unhappy customers trapped. This is the call handling problem.

---

### "They charged me $221 for overage charges for minutes I used that were included in my 200 minute plan."

*— AnswerConnect customer, Trustpilot*

Charged for overages on minutes that were already in the plan. Service turned off randomly. Different reps give different answers every time they call to complain. This is the billing problem — not that the price is too high, but that the invoice doesn't match what was promised.

### "I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore."

*— Ruby Receptionist customer, Trustpilot*

Ruby's quality nosedived post-2023 — after a CEO ouster, a class-action settlement, and a system change. Every call mishandled. Receptionists can't follow basic scripts. This customer was loyal for *years*. That's the reliability problem: services that start strong and decay.

### "Not to mention I am now saving over $1,000 a month by cancelling my answering service!"

*— Dialzara customer, Trustpilot*

A veteran real estate investor who tried multiple AI receptionist services that all failed — before finally finding one that worked. Now saving over a thousand dollars a month. This is the disillusionment problem turned into an opportunity: customers who've given up on the old way and are ready for something fundamentally different.
