# The AI-Native Competitors: Proof of Concept, Not Proof of Execution

Central AI's real competitive threat isn't Ruby or AnswerConnect. It's the wave of AI-native startups attacking the same pain points at 5-10x lower prices ($25-99/mo vs $235-2,800/mo). We tracked eight of them.

## The landscape

| Company | Pricing | Reviews | Churn Quotes | Signal |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Synthflow** | From $29/mo | 69 | **17** | The only one with enough data |
| Dialzara | ~$29-99/mo | 14 | 2 | Gaining switchers, 5.0 avg |
| My AI Front Desk | $79/mo (200 min) | 8 | 0 | 5.0 avg, too small |
| Goodcall | $59-199/mo | 2 | 2 | Bait-and-switch complaints |
| Rosie (HeyRosie) | $49/mo (250 min) | — | 0 | Not on Trustpilot |
| Bland AI | API/enterprise | 1 | 0 | $65M raised, infrastructure play |
| UpFirst | $24.95/mo | — | 0 | Not on Trustpilot |
| Welco AI | Pay-per-use | — | 0 | Not on Trustpilot |

Most of these are too new for meaningful churn data. But Synthflow — with 69 Trustpilot reviews and 17 specific churn stories — gives us a window into what happens when AI-native answering services scale.

## Synthflow: what AI-native churn looks like

Synthflow is the only AI competitor with enough data to analyze. And the churn profile is completely different from legacy services.

**Call handling is nearly eliminated** — only 12% of Synthflow churn vs 47% for legacy services. AI does follow the script every time. That problem is solved.

**But billing is worse** — 47% of Synthflow churn is billing. Bait-and-switch pricing. Essential tools locked behind enterprise plans. Continued billing after cancellation. Non-responsive support. One customer described spending $25K on custom integrations plus $450/month — and the API didn't work.

**And reliability is much worse** — 35% of churn is platform instability. Silent breaking updates. Features that stop working. "The voice is the best I've found, unfortunately the entire rest of the platform is glitchy and doesn't work half the time." This is an engineering problem, not an AI problem.

| Category | % of Synthflow Churn |
|---|:---:|
| Billing (predatory + trap) | 47% |
| Reliability (quality decay + missed calls) | 35% |
| Call Handling (inauthenticity + garbled info) | 12% |
| Disillusionment (serial switching) | 6% |

**Zero script adherence complaints.** The #1 complaint about human-pool services (24% of legacy churn) doesn't appear at all for Synthflow. AI genuinely solves this by design.

## What this means for Central AI

**The good news:** AI-native competitors aren't solving the problem yet. They have the right technology premise but terrible execution on billing, reliability, and support. Central AI can win by avoiding both the legacy failure mode (bad calls) and the AI-native failure mode (broken platform, predatory billing).

**The risk:** Synthflow raised from Atlantic Labs. Bland AI raised $65M (YC, Emergence Capital). These are well-funded competitors who will eventually fix their execution problems. The window where AI-native competitors have broken platforms is temporary.

**Central AI's positioning:**
- **vs legacy incumbents:** "AI follows the script every time" (attacks their #1 weakness)
- **vs AI-native startups:** "AI that actually works, with real support" (attacks Synthflow's #1 weakness)

*Data: Synthflow has 69 Trustpilot reviews (17 churn). Other AI-native competitors have 0-2 churn quotes each — too few for analysis. This should be refreshed as they accumulate more reviews.*
