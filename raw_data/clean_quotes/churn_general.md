### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-11-24 | Quality: ?/5

> As someone who was at a small firm way longer than I should have been, the equal bonus amongst staff was always leaving me on a sour note. As the highest biller (sometimes bringing in more than senior attorneys) and getting the same bonus as the file clerk and receptionist - it made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. It also felt horrible when law clerks and associates would get sometimes a bonus that equaled a partner share - when a lot of their billable hours were written off and mine was always charged. Not to mention - no raises. 

I always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. 

When a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. 

Remember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. 

Just my thoughts!

> You can get yourself reclassified by making some phone calls to the right agencies. I was misclassified as a 1099 and I really regret not making a bigger stink about it. 

Also we pay our receptionists more than you make. I made almost 6x as much as you make as a first year and I do not work BigLaw or in a huge metro area. Time to go.

> Receptionist - overseas remote worker. All calls with OC/clients needs to be scheduled (we use zoom for phones). I don't drop what I'm doing to answer calls (unless there's an emergency).

If the call is from a potential new client, reception routes to Intake, another overseas position.

If new client is qualified, Intake schedules call with salesperson. We use Clio Grow for new clients, but it sucks and I wouldn't recommend it.

Via Clio Grow, new client gets series of emails reminding of appointment, letting them know what to expect ect.

Salesperson uses clio grow to draft template agreement. Clio manage captures payment.

Case is converted to Clio manager where we open template file.

I use notion to outline, step by step, sometimes in painful detail, who does what when for every time of project we might be working on (okay, not every project, I'm still working on it).

Every month, legal team uses chatGPT to send client monthly email update. This is as much for me as the team -- I compare month over month to see if case is moving forward.

Case ends with formal closing procedures.

  
OP, the actual software you use does not matter. That's the least important part. Attorneys will argue forever about what software is "best." The reality is that they are all a shit sandwich. You just need to decide which shit sandwich tastes less shitty than the rest.

The KEY to running a successful, well-run, profitbale business is having SYSTEMS in place and holding the team accountable to those systems. You can write the systems on a napkin and copy them for the team. It doesn't matter. It just needs to be written down and you need to hold the team accountable to those systems you design.

### 4. r/VOIP — 2023-04-02 | Quality: ?/5

> Edge series feels like a premium phone, and has that price tag too. Beautiful UI, great sound, we've not seen any hardware button issues others here mention. One downside is no physical hookswitch - the handset cradle is magnetic. 

Yealink - we would never recommend these anymore. Phones freeze, have FW issues, get ghost calls from sip port scans esp impacting work from home users behind home routers. Yealink phones get the most user complaints- recently we converted an office from T4 series phones to Cisco 8800 series, the receptionist hugged the installer tech and said "thank god" before drop kicking her t43 across the floor.

Anyone who thinks Yealink is a real option vs Cisco, Poly, Mitel (if you're on ringcentral) is not someone who has ever spent much time using any Yealink product. Sadly, these decisions often are made by such IT consultants who don't have to live with them and are just trying to close a deal with the lowest possible price tag for the bean counters at the top of the organization.

### 5. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-09 | Quality: ?/5

> What's your practice area, and what size of city are you in?

When I started out the only thing that worked right away was Google Ads. I made less on those files, but made sure to get good reviews. Within a year I was top of the map pack in my practice area for my city (smallish city). You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick. Also, always ask for a review (unless you mess things up -- in which case I always [only happened once] give full refund and complete work).

I have an SEO guy now. I went through SO MANY, it was frustrating. But finding a good one was worth it. I would strongly caution against a falt-fee or retainer model -- they just pump out AI slop. I pay hourly and we have targets in mind (organic clicks). SEO is pretty great once it's done right, but it does take forever, and I spent way too much on what probably weren't technically scams, but that felt that way. 

I tried to make FB ads work. They are so cheap, but I could never convert them. 

Oh, and here's the industry standard as far as I know for setting calls. You need a receptionist. It's a free consultation to speak to the receptionist, who bills CC for a paid intake call with you. Don't speak to clients for free, or they essentially never close (unless your PI, I don't know how that works). You can get an assistant/receptionist part time, just post on indeed. But you will have to figure out payroll if you do.

### 7. Smith.ai — 2022-06-06 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

**"Mixed Feelings"**

> I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.

> Jaikishan did a great job of giving the tour but getting it scheduled was very difficult. I was connecting through the chat on the app for days with no response. Then when I emailed and scheduled a call with Tim Goddard-Hill, he said he would call me at the time of meeting and he never called so I had to reach out to finally get connected with someone. The Answer Connect team was responsive in trying to earn our business but now that we are clients I have not received great customer service.

**"Dropping the ball"**

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem"

> This company is reliable in the sense that all of our calls get answered but they are terrible at getting all of the required information or even getting it accurate.

When we have tried to work with them to get this resolved, they simply require their people to do more while on the phone with our customers and charge us more because they are a time based billing company.  And, we still have not seen an improvement on the information we receive.

**"70% ok 30% not so much"**

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.

Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off. Do your research and find the best company.

### 13. Ruby Receptionist — 2024-11-23 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

**"Constant Mistakes and Extremely Poor Support"**

> This is one of the worst services I've used as a business owner.

There are CONSTANT mistakes including:

- Collecting and submitting emails incorrectly
- Submitting names incorrectly
- Not collecting required details
- Not submitting forms

In addition to the mistakes, the customer's service is extremely poor. The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.

When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service. When I tried to reach out to her to air my grievances, she basically told me it's not her problem and to deal with support.

I believe that it's a management/operations issue rather than a specific receptionist issue, which is why I've given an extra star.

I am looking for a replacement and canceling the service.

> The service is great. I don't really understand the pricing and seem to get extra charges ad hoc (instead of suggestions to upgrade my plan). This process could be streamlined for busy professionals. Feels like they gouge you because they know you're busy.

Response to response:: No Clue there is an app; how to sign into the app; or what the app does...So the customer service answer is untrue. That goes with my impression of the company. Great product, and professional sounding answer to cover for a lack of meaningful help.

**"This company has changed over the last few years"**

> Used them for a couple years and got way overcharged recently after the service and name changed of the company.

This caused a lot of stress for me and the company. Instead of working with me on our last month being unhappy, the company autocharged the CC for a payment without me okaying it.

I hope to use a different service that doesn’t change in pricing so often and is unreliable.

### 17. Ruby Receptionist — 2019-06-13 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

**"Their sales pitch was initially all…"**

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.

They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.

I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.

I went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.

**Avoid Synthflow at All Costs – Bait and Switch Nightmare**

Synthflow is the definition of a bait-and-switch scam dressed up as a “tech company.” They lure you in with promises of low rates and simple setup, but the truth only hits after you’ve signed up: the tools you actually need are locked behind their absurdly overpriced enterprise plan. They don’t tell you that up front.

I started small, thinking I’d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you’re on enterprise. Unless you’re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.

Their “tech support” takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it’s not with a solution, but with another question—like they didn’t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.

They kept charging me, claiming I didn’t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.

No phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don’t waste your time or money here.

Synthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they’ll vanish.

**"Disappointing Experience with Synthflow.ai's White-Label Service"**

> I entered into an agreement with Synthflow.ai, attracted by their promise of a fully customizable white-label AI voice assistant platform. Their marketing materials and terms suggested that I would be able to rebrand the platform entirely, removing all traces of Synthflow's branding. This was crucial for my business, as I intended to offer this service under my own brand to my clients.​

However, upon implementation, I encountered several issues:

Persistent Synthflow Branding: Despite assurances, Synthflow's logos and branding remained visible throughout the platform, including on client-facing interfaces.​

Support Tickets Redirected to Synthflow: When potential clients submitted support tickets through what was supposed to be my branded platform, they were directed to Synthflow's support channels, undermining the white-label experience.​

Lack of Responsive Support: I reached out to Synthflow's support team multiple times to address these concerns. Unfortunately, their responses were unhelpful, and the issues remained unresolved.​

This experience not only affected my business's credibility but also raised concerns about Synthflow's commitment to their white-label partners. The presence of their branding on my platform confused clients and suggested a direct relationship with Synthflow, which was not the case.​

I advise others considering Synthflow's white-label services to proceed with caution. Ensure you thoroughly test the platform and confirm that all branding can be appropriately customized or removed before making a commitment.​

**"No customer support, lots of lies"**

> I was using their Enterprise package for a few months. With Enterprise plan I had 20000 minutes monthly, but because their batch calling didn't work I couldn't use any of it. They keep posting new updates, but their basic functions don't work. For example, if you upload a list of contacts and first and last name ends in a name row. In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages. Avoid them, save your time, money and nerves. There is so many better software's out there. Extremely dissapointed!

Not even the decency to reply to me saying this is the date for fix or any sort of response. Just plain ignored.

Asked for a refund no reply to this date.

**"Lack of integrity and honesty"**

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!

Just read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.

**"Buyer beware"**

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.

The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.

The HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.

The RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.

Ultimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. 

It is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says “the service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable” and “never should a client experience what you have” yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge. They only offered a credit for the future, which after this experience, we obviously would not use since I cannot recommend them at all.

We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.  We're glad he responded to the review, but we wish he would have responded to our request for a refund after we were incorrectly billed after cancellation instead of doing nothing.

No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. 

To be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. 

At no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when "copying and pasting" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]

This whole “Help us help you” is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no "confirmation" that I was referred to as an "attorney" is just shameful.  

Ignoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services. I had to pay for a separate dedicated Spanish line. I have moved on to a service where all reps are actually bilingual and I get to try their service FREE!

Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request.

**"TRUE feedback AVOID AT ANY COST"**

> This is a TRUE feedback from a VERY disappointed & furious customer.

We were looking for a 24/7 answering services for our English customers who can be anywhere in the world.
We signed with this pathetic company 10 days ago
Actually writing this comment, we don't have any working phone number or chat they decided WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to cut their “service “(we are in the middle of the week end) so our potential leads cannot join us and we have to take all our weekend to find a replacement solution with anybody off. 

We took time to write a complete written process to be followed by their agents, the first 3 days we had to explain them what to do, what to not do ( even the process is easy like a 10 years old boy can understand) but they didn't follow it even after several emails & checks by calling & chatting with them they didn’t. 

An example of a recurrent  idiot problem ? their low IQ agents cannot take INTERNATIONAL phone number standard like +XX (country) (cause our customers can be from anywhere) we sent them several emails , 7 ones on this particular point, no changes , I had to speak with 2 of their managers for nothing, guess what , no changes they still took the phone numbers like everyone is from USA (without country code) and this is a example they didn’t follow our other processes either.

Yesterday, been so furious of their incompetence to not follow a single process like this I sent them "do your job this is pathetic" or we will leave 
And then we received a 'we decide to stop'
Their agents for USA after hours  are NOT in USA , they all got Arabic names and they confirm with me (as professionals they are, you can imagine the stupidity)  that they are offshore agents (which is a shame cause our first question when it was time to select the potential supplier was “are your agents based in USA 100 %” ? ) we can pay for this no problem, answer YES : false 

So if you want your customers to not be able to join you or get complete stupid answers to their query by chat or even better receive phone number from potential leads than you cannot reach (without country code), this is the  perfect solution for bankrupt . 

we are still searching today a replacement , so it is now 3 days without phone numbers, We asked them to give a 5 days notice allows us to find an other provider > no answers and yesterday they charged us 149 USD for the chat, we asked for refund > no answers  

AVOID at all cost : a pure NIGHTMARE, those people are CLOWS

**"⭐ 1 out of 5 stars"**

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars

As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.

They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

**"THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM!"**

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.

That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.

This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.

When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.

First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

I logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these "calls". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these "calls" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.

After calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the "calls" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was "only" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank "calls" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.

Charging full minutes for "calls" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.

I am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing "no response on other line" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.

**"Rude and Unprofessional"**

> Hi, I have a law firm with 228 five star reviews. We use Answer Connect. Recently I received a one-star review from a potential client who stated that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. This is our first one star review ever. I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.

**"Answer Connect is awful"**

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable! This is far from over.

They will promised to credit you for turning off your service and try to charge you anyway. I found a new company and since then realized how much of horrible service I received from them.

**"Worse service ever"**

> My practice sort service from AnswerConnect and it was horrible. They don't provide the service they advertise. They outsort their service to people out of the country who lack the training. Our staff went through the training and all we requested was not done.   When we inquired why they did answer our call as instructed, we were told by Rayne that they didn't know. They are eager to collect your card and charge it but never provide the service. They use your points to do testing. We signed up for 300 minutes by day 4, 70mins was already used between 6 calls that were ours and 6 calls they had for testing. I reached and shared this observation and we were not credited back those mins. We requested for HIPAA and IVR, they charged for it but we never received those services. We had initially requested 500min before service began, they put 300 mins. That took money for the 500mins. To get my refund, no one would return emails or calls. I would discourages from using their service.

**"I am typically not the type that will…"**

> I am typically not the type that will leave a poor review. This company has severely been lacking in their customer service dept this year. They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

**"It is getting frustrating"**

> It is getting frustrating
They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled.
Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back.
This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility.
Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time. 
The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in.
We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

**"Awful Service -Beware"**

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins). 

After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.

We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”. 

We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.

AnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)! They clearly do not value customers and seem more interested in collecting the names and numbers of all of your customers.

Ultimately it seems that unless you are firm who just takes simple phone appointments etc., BEWARE as AnswerConnect could really damage your business reputation.

Super upset with the whole experience.

**"The do not service all areas of healthcare! Please be advised."**

> UPDATE: I have had my reviews flagged and then they called me on a three way with wellreceived to explain themselves. This didn’t end well. I actually hung up on them after I found that they do not have a company ban on clinics that provide rebirth or attachment therapy, and actually the lead person that contacted me was not even aware of what that was. Even though this is illegal in two states, Colorado and North Carolina. 

I explained that this company ban will impact how they do business with hospitals because many medical providers work in multiple facilities and also refer their clients to other providers in the network. It is nearly impossible to NOT affiliate yourself with a licensed provider rendering this service in a state where it is legal, you may as well not operate in a state where this is legal if that is the case. 

If trust pilot needs copies of my phone records to prove that this review is for THIS COMPANY PLEASE ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU MY PHONE RECORDS and EMAILS FROM SALES. 

According to the lead team, the agents while flag calls for keywords, even if they are not regarding self harm, suicidal thoughts or intentions to harm others. Simply inquiring about services that are legal in your state will be enough for your account to be closed or “handled” even if you are operating within the mandated licenseing guidelines and state policies. 

The “global” emphasis was then lost once I pointed out international differences in policy and schedules of drugs. To sum this up, this is purely a subjective decision that impacts a very large demographic.

I was interested in working with them and the service sounded like exactly what I needed. However, after sitting through several calls, I was told that they do not service ANYONE or ANYTHING to do with MEDICAL MARIJUANA. Even if you are a mental health clinic and this is simply offered as an alternative solution, they will refuse to work with you. 

This also applies to all of the companies under the parent company. When I asked if I could speak to someone outside of sales regarding this policy for clarification, I was told that there is no one else and that I was going to be told the same thing. 

So please understand, I was told that your calls will be screened and flagged for keywords, then cancelled.

Response to their response: 
We have several lines that could have been utilized for this service, our company was outright told no. We didn’t need your services to answer calls for that particular examination. We were not even able to explore options to work around it. Such as, your agents simply telling the client that they don’t handle they do not schedule for those calls. Or just using another number all together that doesn’t forward to you. 

We were told flat out that you “DO NOT WORK WITH ANYONE THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THAT SERVICE OR EVEN ASSOCIATES WITH THAT” Even if they are not providing the services themselves, they could simply just be in collaboration with an entity.

**"Terrible and Costly Billing Practices"**

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.

UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.

**"Run, don't walk, far from this company"**

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.

Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.

First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  

I would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It’s horrific. You can't get anyone from their “happiness team” on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  

Their reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their "blame the customer" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.

**"Ruby is terrible!!"**

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month.
2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days.
3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back!
4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

**"I must say that my experience with Ruby is terrible."**

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.

Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.

Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. 

The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.

Frustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another "Urgent" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.

To add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.

I tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.

If you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save you

**"Don't port your GV number!!"**

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.

This request was denied.

The only calls I received were prank calls on a daily basis and a test call from myself.

When the person answered, I couldn't understand what they said.

When I attempted to cancel the service, I waited 7 min. on hold for Customer Service before hanging up and trying again. 

I called again and waited 4 min. before hanging up and trying again.

When I did reach someone, it took over 10 min. to cancel the service, and, they wanted to charge me another 33$...on top of the set-up charge and monthly charges I had already paid.

Please make certain I am not charged 33$.

Thank You.

We registered for their free trial service, they wrote on their website you can try 14 days for free. After the setup, I can't find the things they promoted on the website about the features and capabilities. All things they promoted handled manually, they have not any web panel for managing your service.
Also, they charge you for any call they receive, it's mean they receive many calls not related to your business, they will charge you for nothing.

Finally after a few hours, decided to go for another service.
Their stupid email started from the next day, about setup the account, after some day, 
about some calls we received at the number, we didn't use at all (they have a robot or some fake caller) 
finally, after 2 weeks they sent the invoice and said you should pay for trial service you didn't use it at all.
They really changed the free trial service meaning on the internet.

After received many calls and email from them, I sent an email to them and asked, please stop sending and calling and terminate that stupid thing.
Someone from their company replied you should pay to cancel

**"DO NOT HIRE A WING ASSISTANT"**

> DO NOT HIRE A WING ASSISTANT - they fake their timesheets and lie about doing work.
I used a Wing Assistant for a year, being billed for 4 hours a day for their time.  I assigned approx 1-2 hrs per day of tasks, so I did expect that EVERYTHING would get completed daily within the 4 hours.

My assistant was pretty good for awhile, then after several months I noticed that she was just copy-pasting her daily notes, and daily explanations of what was being completed.  I brought this to the attention of her supervisor, V****, who said he would look into it.  Nothing was resolved.

Several months later, I not only noticed she was still just copy-pasting her daily note, but she had not done one of her REQUIRED DAILY tasks for over a month.  I brought this to her attention as well as to the supervisor's, and then she started calling in sick.  After a few weeks of promises of making up the sick time, promising to fully complete a daily timesheet, I finally asked for a new assistant.

I asked for a refund for the prior 2 months that my assistant had done only 2 hrs of tasks, yet I'd been billed for 80 hours of work.  V***** said that he would not give a refund but he would offer the first 2 months of a new assistant to be free.

When I finally got a replacement assistant, I started off things on the right foot by asking her to give me a full timesheet EVERY SINGLE DAY.  That was my main requirement - just send me one email at the end of each day saying what you accomplished.  She did it a couple times, that's it. She called in sick one day, and said that the power was out several days so that she couldn't work.  After 2 weeks I contacted V**** again and said that this assistant also could not follow directions, was taking time off and then not making up for it, and I wanted the 2 months refunded.

V**** has written me back once, saying no refunds.  I have followed up multiple times complaining that they billed me for 2 months where my assistant was not doing anything - they did not care.  They did nothing to remedy it.  I have not heard back from anyone else, so I'm now resorting to telling everyone that I can -

DO NOT HIRE AN ASSISTANT FROM WING.

(This was originally posted on May 9, 2024, then Wing got my review removed by stating that I'm not allowed to name a person's name.  So now I've edited my original complaint, only removing the manager's name, and reposted on Dec 5, 2025)

**"Paid $1,500/month for an unqualified VA—zero support or accountability"**

> I run three companies and signed up for Wing because I needed a highly capable virtual assistant to manage day-to-day client and staff communications in Washington and take admin work off my plate. Wing upsold me to their $1,500/month “premium” VA plan and promised not only a qualified assistant but also a “customer success manager” supervising them.

The reality: I spent three weeks rewriting almost every email and text my Wing VA sent. I even had to step in personally to phone contractors and customers because the VA could not handle basic customer service or staff management. The VA was clearly underqualified and unskilled—nothing like what Wing advertised. Their so-called “customer success manager” was non-existent in practice; no proactive support, no supervision, and certainly no accountability.

When I finally cancelled and asked for my money back, I learned Wing offers no guarantee. You’re simply out the money, no matter how bad the service.

Since leaving Wing, I’ve hired a new VA on my own. I gave her the exact same SOPs I’d given Wing—and within days she was flawlessly running my company with hardly any input from me. That is what I thought Wing would deliver.

If you’re a busy business owner looking for a vetted, high-level assistant and hands-on support, my experience shows Wing does not stand behind its promises.

When I finally got a response, they admitted to “an unexpected setback that affected [their] ability to meet the initial SLA timeline.”

Despite that, they refused to refund the deposit, claiming that “as outlined in the contract you signed, the deposit is non-refundable, particularly in cases where we’ve already provided candidates for your role.” However, no qualified candidate was actually provided, and communication was virtually nonexistent during that time.

They did offer to apply the deposit “as a credit toward your next hire,” but after this experience, I have no interest in working with them again. The lack of accountability, poor communication, and refusal to make things right makes this a service I cannot recommend.

I've just tried working with them for 5 months and I have mixed feedback: when I started they upsold me to a MID level VA, my digital VA was super nice and hard working but didn't have all the skills to deliver on their promises. I gave them some time to improve and started to feedback to the customer success manager, they promised more trainings, after waiting I realised no more trainings were coming and eventually the customer success manager started pitching me another company they knew and worked for on the side. I cancelled the contract. When I contacted the leadership on Linkedin and email to share my feedback, they were unresponsive, try to spin it my patience against me and finally hide behind their T&Cs. All while sending automated emails about how they have made changes and are better now. I wish I had had a better experience as the begining was great but it ended up terribly.
