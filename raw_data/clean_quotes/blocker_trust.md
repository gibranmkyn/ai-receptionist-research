> Nothing is ever "normal" when you are talking about small firms.  When you are small, you are basically run off the personality of the partner(s).  

With that said, in your first year, your experience is similar to my time working at small firms.  From a firm's preceptive, it is cheaper to send you to serve a document and bill the client instead of paying upfront for a process server and waiting for the client to reimburse you.  And if you are worried about it being done right, you send an attorney instead of the receptionist or other assistant.  As the low person on the totem pole, that job goes to you.

I will say, I hated being the attorney/paralegal/assistant/receptionist at the small firm I worked at.  But, it forced me to learn all those little things that you would not learn at a bigger firm.  When I eventually moved to a bigger firm that actually had support, I truly appreciated the work support staff did and made sure to prep my work to make their tasks easier.  Its also prepared me to handle emergency situations where people are sick and things needs to be done right.

> Beating up your attorneys won’t solve the issue.

My previous firm went through this. 

1) first they hired an “office manager” that brought big corp/big law style drama into our little firm.


That didn’t help matters at all and now the owner of this little 3 attorney firm is paying a full time position for someone whose only job is nag and harass attorneys about “their KPIs” and makes them waste time with a whole new layer of meetings and bureaucracy.

2) then he hired a “customer relationship manager”, in other words a 25 year old dude that picks up the phone and books meetings.

Did I mention that we also have a receptionist that picks up the phone and books meetings?  Did I mention both usually end passing the phone calls to the paralegals anyway? 

That’s another role/extra mouth to feed. 

3) then they began screeching about KPIs,case turnover and all that.  We have never had an issue with case turnover, we were a lean and mean firm! But now the “office manager” has to justify his job, and that means harassing the lawyers and paralegals. And now we have an “office manager” and a “CRM specialist” who are just overhead, so we gotta BILL BILL BILL!

4) so the firm’s owner decided it was time to cut costs… FINALLY! Ok, good, we will be back on track 🙂…. Wait, how is he going to cut costs? By doing the same greedy little thing you suggested, he fired an attorney and one parelegal so he could hire 3 “virtual paralegals” based in India and Philippines and a “foreign attorney” from India who does the stuff and sends it to the other attorneys to review because he can’t really do the attorney job without a US license, so now there is even more stuff on the (real) attorney’s plate, who are already getting choked by the ridiculous KPIs and harassment they’re subject to because they have to pay for the overhead cause by the office manager and the CRM guy.

Guess how the firm is doing now? Hint; I got the heck out of there because it’s a sinking ship. They were just fine from a profitability perspective and from a legal quality perspective until these “amazing optimizations” and “improvements in efficiency” were implemented.

Last I heard this firm is not worried about their rapidly declining profitability because “they will use AI to improve efficiency”, so I guess they are firing a paralegal or two, maybe even an attorney, “ai and smart forms will do it all”.

### 3. r/LawFirm — 2024-12-10 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> Absolutely, it's a huge risk people are taking with the new wave of gen AI products. [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) has two products -- human-first and ai-first. Human is backed up by AI guiding/informing call flow and AI-first is human-in-the-loop for escalation and verification. In neither case is call data used for training a 3rd party LLM or breaching any confidentiality. When we first launched in 2016, a thread blew up on Lawyerist about the risks of using Virtual Receptionists (even pre-AI) in breaching confidentiality and since then we've worked closely with our own customers & legal advisors to make sure we're doing things right.

> You need to formalize ownership and gatekeeping on your matters, in writing, and add a simple approval workflow.

Action plan:

\- Email the partner and that para: for my files, all opposing counsel comms go through me; filings sit in a Ready to File folder until I approve; 24-hour turnaround; 15‑minute weekly huddle to review deadlines. Put the matter number in every subject and use a clear naming rule for drafts vs finals.

\- Track errors in a neutral log; after two weeks, take the data and the workflow to the partner as “this protects clients and the firm,” not a personality fight.

\- Designate the receptionist as your file coordinator with limited authority (calendaring, service, medical records, follow‑ups). Cheaper than burning attorney time.

\- Self‑manage only high‑risk items (court filings, OC calls) until trust is earned; everything else runs through your checklist.

\- Bridge hire: pitch a contract/fractional para 10–15 hrs/week for 90 days with KPIs (cycle times, zero missed deadlines). Full‑time para makes sense once you consistently collect 2.5–3x their total cost and you’re at \~120–150 active WC files or 3+ trials/month.

On tools: I’ve used Clio and DocuSign, but SignWell’s templates and sequential routing cut our retainer/med‑auth back‑and‑forth and unclogged bottlenecks.

Formalize ownership and workflows now so you can serve clients and avoid burnout.
