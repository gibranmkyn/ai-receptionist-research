We didn't have time to go through months of false starts again for this position... then we learned about Wing Assistant. Wing made the process so easy - they had an administrative assistant on within a few days and she has been terrific. She's very skilled in administrative functions, software and support best practices. Working with Wing gave us peace of mind because they did the recruiting, hiring and should we ever need a replacement, they would take care of that within days as well. We will definitely use Wing again when we need help. They can provide any level or skillset needed, plus they take care of the employee benefits, payroll, etc. I highly recommend their services.",

I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.

The only thing you might be able to compete on clearly is price, but these clients have money and would probably prefer to pay more if they got a better perceived chance of success in their criminal case. I can't see a handful of internet ads you pay for changing any of that.\n\nIf your plan was more a more general criminal law focus, I think you'd be ok. You might also try to push federal criminal defense as a subspeciality, in my state it's often notably harder to find a lawyer to practice in federal court compared to state court.\n\nIf you want some complexity to keep",

It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately.

I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.\n\nFast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two \"back office\" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  \n\nFast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.\n\nFinally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my \"main line\" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.

The distinction makes a big difference. If you applied to a job posted as \"legal assistant\" but they started off right away discussing a mailroom job, that's not a good sign and I probably wouldn't proceed with them. \n\nIf it's the latter and they said something like, \"I don't think your skills and experience match with our needs for a legal assistant at this point, but we're willing to move forward with a mailroom position,\" then that means they see something in you even though you might not be a fit for the original position.

Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. \nAI could help with that but prospects don\u2019t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren\u2019t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can\u2019t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.

After about 5 years, the firm had grown, and I started taking over some of the lighter firm administrative duties, in addition to my lead litigation role.  We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.  My solo did securities litigation and arbitration (me), some personal injury, and elder law.  All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.\n\nMy boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.\n\nThis allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.\n\nBy the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.  We had such a great group of staff working there, so staff issues were minimal.\n\nHe also purchased a business condo, which turned out to be a wonderful firm investment.

Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws?

There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work\n* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn\u2019t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly.

One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.\n\nFor bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.\n\nConsider having an answering service to present a \"bigger\" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.\n\nFor hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:\n\nPrinter with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.\n\nSheet feed scanner is useful.

Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document.

We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)\n\nEach of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. \n\nThen it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is.

If you expect more than that, you're kidding yourself. AnswerConnect is probably one of the better services available, but they're not great. They have issues directly related to personnel turnover that are pretty much unavoidable and aren't likely to change no matter how hard they care or try. Would I recommend them? Sure.",

    "text": "So far, I have experienced fewer problems with AC than I did with one of their competitors. Their service gets the job done, most of the time. They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.\r\n\r\nInexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.\r\n\r\nI am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.",

Callers expect people to know how to pronounce the business name and to be transferred to the right person 100% of the time. While no one is perfect that's the goal. The service is good and functioning but we don't get much satisfaction from our clients who are put through the service. It seems seem less as you review it. Not sure 100% why, it could be simply the process but that's our experience.",
