    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.",

There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect.

Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says \"purchase now\". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off.

Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!\n\nJust read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked.

Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.\n\nThe HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.\n\nThe RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.\n\nUltimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month.

They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the \"phone tree\" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.",

As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.\n\nUPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.

After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the ca",

I even had to step in personally to phone contractors and customers because the VA could not handle basic customer service or staff management. The VA was clearly underqualified and unskilled\u2014nothing like what Wing advertised. Their so-called \u201ccustomer success manager\u201d was non-existent in practice; no proactive support, no supervision, and certainly no accountability.\n\nWhen I finally cancelled and asked for my money back, I learned Wing offers no guarantee.
