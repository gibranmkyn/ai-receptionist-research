    "text": "Nothing is ever \"normal\" when you are talking about small firms.  When you are small, you are basically run off the personality of the partner(s).  \n\nWith that said, in your first year, your experience is similar to my time working at small firms.  From a firm's preceptive, it is cheaper to send you to serve a document and bill the client instead of paying upfront for a process server and waiting for the client to reimburse you.  And if you are worried about it being done right, you send an attorney instead of the receptionist or other assistant.  As the low person on the totem pole, that job goes to you.\n\nI will say, I hated being the attorney/paralegal/assistant/receptionist at the small firm I worked at.  But, it forced me to learn all those little things that you would not learn at a bigger firm.  When I eventually moved to a bigger firm that actually had support, I truly appreciated the work support staff did and made sure to prep my work to make their tasks easier.  Its also prepared me to handle emergency situations where people are sick and things needs to be done right.",

What's obnoxious is hiring a legal assistant, receptionist, or other law firm staff and then expecting that person to do personal tasks like picking up dry cleaning.\n\nIt's a common problem in very small firms - especially if there's two partners and they're married to each other! - for the owner/partners to fail to maintain enough separation between their personal and professional lives.  It causes drama and dissatisfaction.  Don't ask your legal secretary to do personal errands; the secretary will resent doing them and your partner will resent paying for them.  If personal services are what you need the most help with, hire a personal assistant, on your own dime not the firm's; be clear about your expectations, treat the assistant with respect and pay them well.  \n\nAlso don't ask either a legal assistant or a personal assistant to clean the office.  Get a janitor for that.",

    "text": "Actually just worked on a project where we tried to Define and write down the specific job duties for legal secretaries and paralegals.    \n\nSome of this is going to be very specific to the environment.  For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. \n\nWhat we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training \n\nAttorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. \n\nSecond, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. \n\n\nA really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. \n\nHowever getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done.

When I need a certificate of conference on a motion to compel I can filter the notes in the file and pull any tagged \"Defense counsel\" and grab the dates to list how many times I conferred with defense on the issue. I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. \n\n2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. \n\n3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from \"service\" to \"litigation\" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. \n\n4.

IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. \n\nSecond, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. \n\nThird, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. \n\nFinally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.",

Not to mention - no raises. \n\nI always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. \n\nWhen a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. \n\nRemember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. \n\nJust my thoughts!",

Your GPA will be an issue for getting into a law school, but you're probably already knocked out of consideration of the higher ranked schools (I had a 2.7 coming out of college and was in the lowest quarter of my entering class).\n\nI generally try to dissuade people from going to law school mainly because the price tag isn't worth it.  Most people coming out of law school are not going to have jobs that earn enough money to live and pay back the monstrous loans.  Those that are capable of paying their loans take on extremely soul-sucking jobs to do so.  \n\nThe apprenticing model in California requires you to work in a lawyer's office.  If you're interested at all, I would try to find a non-attorney job (like a paralegal or investigator) to get into an office and show you what the industry is like.  My first job out of college was as a receptionist for a small law firm in Boston.  I did go on to law school, but never landed a \"real\" law job afterwards and now I do compliance for the Federal Government.  It took almost twenty years after graduating to get to a comfortable spot.  Not lucrative, but comfortable.",

Identify the people who are willing to assist you and the ones who are overworked and stressed and act accordingly. \n\nBest advice I got when I started out: If an attorney asks you a question you don't know the answer to never say \"I don't know.\", say \"I'm not sure, let me get back to you.\" and then go figure it out. \n\nGood luck!!!

    "text": "> this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?\n\nNo, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).\n\nPhones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.\n\nAnother thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as \"line 1\" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest ",

They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well\n\n2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done\n\n3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.\n\n4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  \n\n5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer",

Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.\n2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.\n3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.\n4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.\n\n> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.\n\nPart of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.\n\n> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.\n\n> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?\n\nYes.... but you are at a tricky spot.

I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn\u2019t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don\u2019t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.",
