> I used [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) - they were fine, but very new when I used them (2014-2015 I think). The main issue is that the receptionists were work from home, so call quality and background noise.

Then I used Gabbyville - they were good too, and I don't really remember why I left.

Finally, I used Ruby.  I highly, highly recommend. They were a bit more expensive, but well worth the cost. Plus they really tried to be one of the team (at least twice I said direct my calls to voicemail because I was ill, and they would send me a care package).

> I use my case
I’ve never even heard of the program that you use, but I’m going to check it out. I’m happy with mycase, but it can’t hurt to see what you’re using. 

I think you’re in estate planning. If so, you should reach out to divorce lawyers in the area that you service. Explain to them that once their clients are divorced they’ll need a new estate plan. (obviously you have to focus on the divorce lawyers that service the middle-class and upper class.) offer them a referral fee. I imagine you’ll get a fair amount of work.

I’m curious as to why you need Lexis. I’m not throwing any shade. I mean it’s an honest question. Estate planning law changes slowly. I run a family law firm 82.7% of our time is spent on Paternity, Divorce, and family law post judgment order modification. The rest is spent doing estate planning for our middle and upper class clients post judgment. 

I read what used to be called the advanced sheets— that is the appellate cases and state Supreme Court cases relevant to family law as they come out. They are free and I’m sure they’re free in your state too. On September 1, 2024 my state, California, modified the algebra equation we use to calculate child support. Legal news reported it six months before it happened so no surprises for us.

Depending on how much you’re earning the 350 you’re gonna be paying for Lexus could be significant and might be a cost you can do without

I found that if you focus on a certain area such as estate planning or family law, the amount of new laws very modest and as a result, Alexis or West law subscription is unnecessary  (using fastlaw) to ensure any cases you cite are up-to-date (ie Shepardize the cases).

I’m very interested in your virtual legal assistant. And I’d love it if you had the time too expand on that either on this post or DM. I have four experience, legal assistance and office manager one real receptionist +4 virtual receptionists that we pay for as an expense words I don’t give them 1099s. 

I love my virtual receptionists. I’ve made an effort to get to know them and to be interested in them at least superficially and they really do a great job for us. The way we have it set up. Is potential clients go to me or to the office manager. and we can switch that up on the fly. My unique sales proposition is that I have a lot of litigation experience,  so I’m in court three days out of five. But I don’t always have to spend the entire day there. Plus our court takes a lunch break from 12 to 130 during which I spent a portion of my time prepping the parties and witnesses for the second half of the day and a portion of my time returning calls.

I think it’s important that the owner of the firm takes client calls often.   I’m personable. I speak plainly and I am the person who is best able to judge whether the client is a good fit.

**"UK AI Consultant - easy to start & integrate"**

Really fast and intuitive to get started and use (I integrate with Bubble). Love the 'Group Support Call', podcasts with other users, and the Academy to get you started. Docs are comprehensive. And the White Label option opens up a lot of avenues.

Quick tip if you're in the UK - you'll need a UK number from Twilio to be able to send post-call SMS (you can still make calls with a Synthflow number), and there will be a ~1 day 'Regulatory Bundle' you'll need to do before getting a UK number. But I got that and now have my number.

**"Great experience for me and my customers!"**

> I’ve been using Smith AI for the last four months. I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn’t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don’t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.

I have received nothing but compliments so far and the callers have been shocked that its really Ai vs a live message and how quick I returned their call. Smith delivers the message immediately after the call ends via email. Another plus is how they can filter and block spam calls! The dashboard allows me to view, mark and block calls too. So far so good!

> We recently needed to set up a new sub-account and a customized script for our preferred customer support line at AnswerConnect, and the experience was exceptional from start to finish.

Tracy and Ruth were both helpful and responsive, but I want to especially recognize Gabrielle Scilley, our Client Account Manager.

Gabrielle went above and beyond at every step, incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and proactive. She understood exactly what we were trying to achieve and made sure every detail was handled correctly.

Highly recommended!

What really stood out to me is how realistic it sounds compared to other AI call systems I’ve tested — including some that cost significantly more. It handles real client conversations well, filters out marketing and solicitation calls, and helps keep my day organized instead of constantly interrupting it.

Overall, it’s been a solid tool for managing calls and improving how we handle client communication.

**"We were skeptical about AI, but this helped us scale"**

> We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.

We started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.

What surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.

Since making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.

Since then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.

We would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.

**"Ruby is such a wonderful tool!"**

> Ruby is such a wonderful tool with EXCELLENT customer service for your company! Everyone is always very kind, follow up is excellent and I can rest easy knowing they are handling our phone calls. Bri helped me out with going over our minutes being used and definitely help me understand what plan we should use. Not only was that great, she said she’d follow up with me in a week…and she did! It’s hard sometimes to get people to actually follow up, so excellent work Bri!

**"Dedication "**

> I was blown away by the lengthy, articulate and expansively descriptive email response Ruby sent me regarding assessment of the intake calls process.  Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn’t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors. Thank you again Ruby for the winner mentality, look forward to taking your good service to great and even better!

When our previous call center was costing us valuable potential cases compared to the "value" pricing of their service, we took a leap of faith and signed on with Ruby.

**"I just wanted to share my experiencePATLive won me over from Day One!"**

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.

I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.

Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me—PATLive won me over from Day One!

Amy Hearn was our on-boarding specialist and was wonderful through the whole set-up process & trial period. She explained everything we needed to know and was quick to answer any questions we had. When testing the call service operators each experience was positive and professional. Now we are past the on-boarding period and rely on daily message logs and their normal Customer Service Team which have also proven to be just as responsive.

They are able to integrate with my CRM to be able to track the calls easily and have all the data that i need readily available to return the calls with all the info that I need to have a good conversation. 

If you company get spam calls or hate calls, this is a great service to be able to weed out these calls and only talk to the people who are actually interested in working with you.

Last time we had to hire we went through 3 hires who didn't work out before we found a good fit. We didn't have time to go through months of false starts again for this position... then we learned about Wing Assistant. Wing made the process so easy - they had an administrative assistant on within a few days and she has been terrific. She's very skilled in administrative functions, software and support best practices. Working with Wing gave us peace of mind because they did the recruiting, hiring and should we ever need a replacement, they would take care of that within days as well. We will definitely use Wing again when we need help. They can provide any level or skillset needed, plus they take care of the employee benefits, payroll, etc. I highly recommend their services.

Over the years, I have worked with Wing to find assistants to cover me 24/7. Not only do I get to work LESS, but my services are available MORE. They are communicative, fast learning and I’ve had no worry about turnover rate. If I need a replacement, they find them. But no one’s ever just quit on me, which speaks volumes about their management capabilities. Thanks, Wing!

They also make sure to have just enough oversight to not be overbearing and intrusive but also make sure the quality of work is great. Now, whether you will be compatible with the person they found is entirely out of their hands. However, they do offer replacements if it doesnt work out.

The pricing on this is a little high vs. the quality of the AI but not overly high. Smith AI compensates me for this review.

Their departments are unorganized, there's no ownership for handling actual customer issues, response time on the back end is significantly delayed. Ironically, attempting to talk with someone who has any authority to make a decision is impossible. Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more likely a canned or ai generated email with be received instead.

Smith.ai has since done a fantastic job to help correct the issues we were experiencing, specifically when Coralyn and Christene got involved following up and continuing to ensure the accounts are updated and working correctly.

> For almost any task, you can either pay someone to take it off your hands, or automate it.

Whether you can do so ethically, affordably, and maintaining sufficient quality, is a different matter.

I think practice management software like smokeball, mycase, PracticePanther and Clio Manage are absolutely worth the price just for the organization alone, and they include extra quality of life like escrow management, electronic signature, automated workflow, and document automation.  How much benefit you get depends on how much effort you put into setting it up and making sure you use it properly

Depending on your field, there may be dedicated drafting software.  Do not use AI drafting, there’s too big a chance of having mistakes, missing something important, or generating a hallucinations - not to mention issues regarding client confidentiality; do not ever put in identifying information.  You can use AI to help create an outline or rewrite a paragraph, but treat it as a dishonest college student who would rather make things up, and will insist on being right even if it’s wrong.

Then there’s CRM like Lawmatics and Clio Grow.  This helps manage your marketing and client intake.  But it still requires time and effort on your part, and might not help you all that much.  

A paralegal can do a lot of grunt work, and if you don’t want to commit to a full time employee, you can hire a virtual paralegal (paid by the hour)

You can get a receptionist, a chatbot, or an answering service to answer calls and/or chats on your website.  The quality will never be the same as what you can deliver

Bookkeeping you can and probably should get software, but that still takes up a lot of time.  The best thing you can do is hire an actual bookkeeper, they’re cheap enough.

It is possible to create a fully automated process where a client fills out a form or questionnaire online and documents are automatically created.  That has two drawbacks: (1) your client doesn’t see the difference between you and legalzoom or rocketlawyer and they’ll wonder why they’re paying you.  (2) your clients will make mistakes in entering their information, and may select the wrong options if you let them.  I won’t do it, people pay me a premium price for a premium service and I want to make sure it’s done right

> I’m not a lawyer, I’m a growth strategist  and fractional CMO for lawyers/ firms and you’re getting amazing advice here. 

A few things I’d add: 

1. Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.
2. Make sure there’s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.
3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. 
4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.
5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc 
6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority 
7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it 

Once you’ve got some clients going and you want more or you’ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there’s advanced marketing strategies I’d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. 

I’m excited for you. I hope it goes well! 

If you’re got more questions feel free to ask.
