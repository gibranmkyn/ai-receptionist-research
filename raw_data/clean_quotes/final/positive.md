**Pain point:** 24/7 availability is transformative for emergency restoration business; receptionists qualify leads and route calls, saving countless hours; flat-rate per-call pricing is predictable with no charges for blocked spam
*User type: business_owner*

Smith.ai has exceeded our expectations by delivering professional, polished service that resonates with our discerning clientele from the very first contact.

### 2. ? — 2025-11-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Business owner feared AI company impact on customers but AI assistant handles calls according to preset standards, transfers to live person when needed, and provides detailed email transcriptions; couldn't afford a sales team so this was the solution
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve been using Smith AI for the last four months. I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn’t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don’t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.

### 4. r/LawFirm — 2024-06-22 | 5pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY

**Pain point:** Uses 24/7 answering service to capture leads on weekends and after hours because calling a lead on Monday means they already hired someone else
*User type: business_owner*

> Yes.

Do you really want to call the lead on Monday only to have them tell you, “sorry, I already hired someone else?”

Generating new business is the most difficult thing we do. It’s also one of the most expensive. If you don’t want to call on the weekends or after hours, hire someone else to do it. I have a 24/7 answering service that will transfer qualified leads to my cell phone.

*User type: business_owner*

It’s just the perfect combination and they also make outgoing calls so you can get people to confirm your appointment appointments for you or you can get questions answered without having to waste time making those rounds of calls or adding extra staff if you have a small business like I do.

We have had less than stellar experiences with live answering services in the past, so were overjoyed to find that the live agents with Smith AI have been consistently professional, warm and helpful to our potential clients.

**Pain point:** AI receptionist sounds more realistic than other systems tested (including more expensive ones), handles real conversations, filters solicitation calls, and keeps the day organized.
*User type: business_owner*

> We started using Dialzara to help manage incoming calls, and it’s been surprisingly easy to set up and adjust. Teaching it, correcting it, and refining how it responds didn’t take much time at all.

What really stood out to me is how realistic it sounds compared to other AI call systems I’ve tested — including some that cost significantly more. It handles real client conversations well, filters out marketing and solicitation calls, and helps keep my day organized instead of constantly interrupting it.

Overall, it’s been a solid tool for managing calls and improving how we handle client communication.

**Pain point:** Started using answering service during COVID when staff was stressed and overworked; 24/7 call coverage including middle-of-the-night for a mortuary business; still using 5 years later
*User type: employee*

> Abby Connect has been an amazing addition to our business.  We first started using Abby during the Covid pandemic when our own staff was stressed, overworked and needed some help with the volume of phone calls we were receiving.  The Abby team quickly learned the unique needs of our business and five years later we are still happy with their service.  Our business receives calls 24/7, and even in the middle of the night the receptionists are kind and helpful.
Over the past several months Pricilla has been the one to answer almost every email I have sent, responding within a short time with concise information and confirmations of our changes.
I would recommend Abby to anyone who wants to take some of the load off of their administrative team.

Sincerely,

### 19. r/LawFirm — 2024-12-28 | 4pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm has used Ruby Receptionist for 14 years to screen calls, take messages, and present a professional appearance, making the small firm extremely productive.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have used Ruby as a reception service since we opened 14 years ago. It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately. (We also only conduct busines calls and emails during work hours except if it's a emergency.)

### 20. r/LawFirm — 2025-05-02 | 3pts | Quality: 4/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Detailed recommendation for Ruby Receptionist as a call screening and forwarding service for law firms, including specific workflow for handling sales calls, court calls, and VIP callers.
*User type: business_owner*

> Hire Ruby Receptionist to answer your forwarded line to Ruby. It's well worth the expense. Have Ruby collect pertinent caller info (caller name, case, matter, etc) have her forward your law related calls to you with brief caller intro from Ruby to you (where you either take the call or have her take a message or send to vm; call info then goes to you via text, email or app) & have Ruby thank all sales solicitors for their call, but you are not interested in their service or product & to please take you off you their calling / contact list immediately. Ruby is very good at dealing with sales calls if you instruct them to never put them through. We also have Ruby immediately put through anyone from the Court or their office, our bank that might be calling with a trust account issue, & other VIP callers.

### 21. r/LawFirm — 2023-08-20 | 2pts | Quality: 4/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Smith.ai works well for solo lawyer with simple call routing: new clients get scheduled, existing clients get messages, urgent calls get transferred; but warns it won't scale for high call volumes.
*User type: business_owner*

> Maximumlawyer: I'm not a regular listener, but I was thinking through intake processes and those episodes were pretty good.

[Smith.ai](https://Smith.ai): You have to keep your instructions and process simple enough that anyone can follow instructions. This is because any one of their employees might answer the phone, and they'll be looking at your instructions on a screen when they do so. 

They will schedule on a calendar of your choice, or integrate with Clio for intake. They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!

I've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.

So far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.

For demand generation, it’s mostly just me using ChatGPT to get a solid draft going We’ve got a full-time receptionist, but during after-hours or when she’s already on a call, I use Lawtte to handle overflow.

**Pain point:** Solo attorney spends ~$1,200/mo on tech stack including answering service integrated with Lawmatics for intake, considers it worthwhile compared to hiring an employee.
*User type: business_owner*

> Lawmatics (tracking leads, costs per lead, cost per client, fee agreements, calendar links)—> Clio (billing, logging emails, case notes, client contact info, texting, receiving documents) —> jubilee for bankruptcy or WealthCounsel for estate planning. Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

I’d generally recommend. They have good customer support for setup and when things go wrong. You have to be watchful of things like a lead needing urgent help and calling 5 times. That’ll cost you $50 plus. But they’ll take instructions like don’t take second calls and fwd to voicemail.

### 96. r/LawFirm — 2023-03-06 | 4pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Law firm uses an answering service for inbound intake requests that provides brief matter summaries, helping manage overflow from a busy practice.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

### 100. r/LawFirm — 2025-01-11 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Solo PI attorney launching a firm includes Smith.ai in their tech stack for receptionist services as part of startup costs.
*User type: business_owner*

> I just got done launching my solo PI firm this first week of 2025! Thank you for this list, I definitely referenced it a few times. I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:

1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my "finalist" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer "office" over "firm".

2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my "finalist" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, "first.lastinjurylawoffice.com" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. 

3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. 

4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. "Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert." If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. 

5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. 

6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free

7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) 

8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. 

9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. 

10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. 

11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. 

12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.

She also shared additional insights that made signing up with PATLive an easy and obvious decision. I truly wish every company had dedicated professionals like Jessica on their team.
