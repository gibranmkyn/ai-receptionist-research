**Pain point:** Ruby's pricing increased 42% over a few years, from $699/mo in 2011 to $1,279/mo in 2018, with annual increases making the service uncompetitive.
*User type: business_owner*

> While the service is good, the price is not. Every year you can count on another big increase. If you are considering a US-based receptionist service, look around because there are better alternatives.

**Pain point:** Customer proactively sought to reduce monthly invoice because they were not using all the minutes in their plan; rep created a custom plan to match actual usage.
*User type: business_owner*

> I contacted Answer Connect via chat to reduce our monthly invoice since we were not approaching the number of minutes in our plan. The representative reviewed our file and went to talk with the team about options. In a few hours, Flora Roy, the representative, called with a plan that was created for us which matched our needs. She was very professional and willing to go the extra mile to ensure that we were spending our money wisely.

**Pain point:** Answering service costs over $200/mo for 250 minutes, prices keep rising, and bot calls consume precious paid minutes with no automatic blocking.
*User type: business_owner*

> Great service but very highly priced per month, unless you're going to be using it, make sure you got some money over $200/mo is very, very high price and you'll need at least 250 minutes to work your business incoming calls.

Wish it was cheap like around $130 but they've been gradually raising their prices if you cancel and opt back in you get the higher prices.

Good experienced at taking calls. You have to test to make sure your scripts and flow are being used correctly. 

Also bots tend to call, so you got to have someone monitor it and tell them to block it...they need to have an automatic bot message blocking function for free. It's using our precious minutes

### 4. r/LawFirm — 2023-06-21 | 8pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Ruby**

**Pain point:** Solo attorney lists Ruby virtual receptionist as an expense alongside malpractice insurance, Lexis, and other overhead costs, showing answering services are a meaningful cost burden
*User type: business_owner*

> Not for me.  I worked harder and made less.  Even more work was not billable, and I couldn’t justifiably bill at my prior firm rate ($100/hr less).  Plus, I had significantly more expenses (office, malpractice insurance, internet, Lexis, billing system, CPA, taxes, Ruby virtual receptionist, LawPay, CLEs and memberships, bar dues, computer and printer/copier systems, website design and hosting, advertising, and a coverage attorney contractor for hearings that conflicted or for assistance when I was swamped).  Plus, I had a wider range of less reliable clients that resulted in a reduced collection rate and more time and effort to be paid fully.  Also, my personal health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance, 401k retirement savings, paid vacation, and other benefits were gone.  It wasn’t easy and resulted in a net about $20k less than I made at the firm and no vacation, which was fine for me until I got married and had a child.  Some years were better and I made more than at the firm, but never more than 10-15% more and always with way more hassle.  #freedom

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect removed lower-tier pricing options, frustrating businesses that don't use many minutes.
*User type: business_owner*

> The service is decent, not great. I was mostly happy with it until they took away the lower tier pricing. They definitely need to go back to more plan options for businesses who don't use as many minutes.

### 6. ? — 2021-02-27 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Receptionists ignore the script and put customers on hold despite instructions not to, and pricing is too high for a small business.
*User type: business_owner*

> Hi,
The receptionist are very nice. I have asked many times not to put my customers on hold.  I made the script so easy I do not see why some receptionist still put the customer on hold.  We pay a lot and we need to get the price down.  If we can't do this we will need to change company's because we are not a big company and can not afford to be put on hold when there is no reason for it.  Please call me about this on going problem.

**Pain point:** Expensive answering service does not consistently follow instructions despite premium pricing.
*User type: business_owner*

### 8. r/LawFirm — 2024-08-21 | 20pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **OpenPhone**

**Pain point:** Solo attorney lists remote receptionist at $15/mo as part of startup cost stack, showing it is a standard line item for new firms
*User type: business_owner*

> For reference, Im a biglaw corporate and tax (M&A) in the DC area launching a solo firm in one week. I’m taking a few PE clients with me but downshifting to small business work. My start up costs so far (still figuring some things out) in round numbers are:

Entity registration: 250
Malpractice insurance: 1500 annually 
Web/branding/photos: 5000 one time - no maintenance or SEO needed 
45k working capital LOC: 600 lender fees
Openphone: 275 annually
Adobe: 15/mo
Clio: 35/mo
Office 365: 7/mo
Quick books: 17/mo intro rate 
Remote receptionist: 15/mo
Square space: 15/mo

I splurged on the website bc I’m using a client. You can do your own for like 50/100 bucks and get a logo on fiverr or something.

I plan to buy a Lenovo laptop or something g similar from Costco for $500 or so in the near future. 

I’m working from home and using conference space at my accountant’s office if ever needed. Most of my meetings and closings are remote. 

I’m probably missing something but that’s a good start. I have about 30k in cash set aside to draw on until I generate steady revenue.

*User type: business_owner*

> Ruby is such a wonderful tool with EXCELLENT customer service for your company! Everyone is always very kind, follow up is excellent and I can rest easy knowing they are handling our phone calls. Bri helped me out with going over our minutes being used and definitely help me understand what plan we should use. Not only was that great, she said she’d follow up with me in a week…and she did! It’s hard sometimes to get people to actually follow up, so excellent work Bri!

*User type: business_owner*

> How much does an answering service cost for your business?

For all of the businesses that use an answering service, how much do they charge and do they only answer/forward calls for you? I’m thinking of getting one for my business that deals with a lot of contractors. Would you recommend using an answering service?

### 16. r/SaaS — 2025-05-11 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** AI receptionist startup offering $14.99/mo plans with dedicated phone number, trying to undercut competitors charging $50-100/mo for similar features.
*User type: vendor*

> We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)

Hey everyone! We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!
