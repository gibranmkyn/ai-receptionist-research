## Churn Billing (25 quotes)

### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-04-04 | 6pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Dropped Smith.ai after two years because they became more expensive and charge per call; switched to AnswerConnect which charges per minute and is much cheaper
*User type: business_owner*

> Used smith.ai for about two years. They were great, but became more expensive. Plus they charge you per call, which I'm not a fan of. So I switched to answerconnect. Much cheaper since they charge per minute. YMMV since I only use the answering service to get extremely basic information from the client and the calls just don't take very long.

### 2. ? — 2019-01-04 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Charged for calls to a recycled phone number unrelated to the business, billed over $30 for internal testing during an upgrade, and lost a day of customer calls due to flawed setup.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  

I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  

Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.

The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  

Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

### 3. ? — 2020-12-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Answering service bill is 7-10x the expected budget; agents continually misspell names, emails, and addresses despite the critical importance of accuracy.
*User type: business_owner*

> Accurate information is extremely important.  We continually receive misspelled names, emails, addresses from the agents.  I know not all callers are happy to share but we can’t be guessing either.  Also had a budget in mind for what I would pay for this service and the bill has remained 7-10 times over that price every month.  I have really low expectations, just trying to survive in a sea of complications so would like to eliminate all internal obstacles.  We are stubbornly hanging on hoping for better results out of this engagement.  I give it average but I have nothing to compare it too except our own or previous office staff.

### 4. ? — 2026-01-15 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without consent raising the bill; settings don't save; cancellation process is intentionally difficult.
*User type: business_owner*

> The AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without my consent which will raise my bill. Does not save settings. Super dishonest business. Cannot cancel. They make you email to request cancellation!! I had to dig for their phone number only to talk to a receptionist who can't cancel for me! Now I have to wait for a call and hopefully they will cancel. Never again! If you need an AI receptionist look elsewhere.

### 5. ? — 2025-12-29 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Upsold to a plan costing $700/month more than needed; support was unreachable; company overcharged by over $3,000 over 5 months.
*User type: business_owner*

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!

Just read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.

### 6. ? — 2023-11-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Billing errors from day one, promised HubSpot/RingCentral integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support; not worth $2,800/month.
*User type: business_owner*

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.

The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.

The HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.

The RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.

Ultimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. 

It is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says “the service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable” and “never should a client experience what you have” yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge. They only offered a credit for the future, which after this experience, we obviously would not use since I cannot recommend them at all.

### 7. ? — 2023-10-02 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Continued billing after cancellation; refused refund unless credit card dispute was withdrawn; VP asked them to remove negative review.
*User type: business_owner*

> (SEE EDIT BELOW) Generally an okay company, but one star for questionable billing practices.  Company continues to bill us even though our service was canceled.  We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.  We're glad he responded to the review, but we wish he would have responded to our request for a refund after we were incorrectly billed after cancellation instead of doing nothing.

### 8. ? — 2025-09-10 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Systematic overbilling through opaque 'after-call work' charges; calls lasting 2:20 billed as 5 minutes; hundreds or thousands in overcharges with no transparency.
*User type: business_owner*

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars

As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.

They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

### 9. ? — 2025-04-30 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Answering service promised 30 free calls under 30 seconds but charged for all; bill was $360 vs contracted $275 despite using fewer minutes than allotted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.

That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.

This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.

When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.

First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

I logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these "calls". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these "calls" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.

After calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the "calls" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was "only" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank "calls" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.

Charging full minutes for "calls" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.

I am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing "no response on other line" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.

### 10. ? — 2024-11-25 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Charged by the minute while agents ask callers to spell everything 3-4 times to inflate call time; information not taken from script; told clients they weren't clients.
*User type: business_owner*

> We used these for 6 months, they charge by the minute listening to the calls they ask you to spell everything out 3 to 4 times........escalating time on the phone and charging you £1.75 a min after your package hits its limit!!!!!!! 
When we informed them numerous times their service was not acceptable by:
Information not taken from the script given or passed to the on call engineer.
Telling clients that they are not a client when our client list has been provided etc etc .........

The one star has been awarded as you can cancel the contract with them on the spot.

### 11. ? — 2023-05-01 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Bottom-of-barrel receptionist quality who barely read scripts; billing doubled without notice; call duration hidden to obscure how long staff spends on calls.
*User type: business_owner*

> If I can give zero stars I would. Most reviews here do not seem to reflect reality of this company - certainly not mine. Probably fakes. 

We have used AC for over a year. Here is what I can tell you. Bottom of the barrel quality of receptionists. They barely read the script, let alone do anything more complicated like qualify a customer. 

THEY CHANGED OUR BILLING AND STARTED CHARGING US DOUBLE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNLESS WE HAD CAUGHT IT, IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED. SHADY SHADY PRACTICES. THE COMPANY OWNERS ARE TERRIBLE. 

They don't show you total minutes of a call so you don't see how long their staff takes on the phones.

### 12. ? — 2023-03-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Service switched off after credit card update; forced to buy new subscription at 3.5x the price to get business line back; left without phone for 35 days.
*User type: business_owner*

> I am typically not the type that will leave a poor review. This company has severely been lacking in their customer service dept this year. They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

### 13. ? — 2025-10-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm grew and Ruby started dropping calls of potential and existing clients; charged for dropped calls; forced to stay 26 more days costing $1,100 after cancellation.
*User type: business_owner*

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.

UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.

### 14. ? — 2022-12-03 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** 30-40% of calls dropped after switching from Google Voice; Clio integration doesn't work; receptionists clock inflated call times for basic info collection.
*User type: business_owner*

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.

### 15. ? — 2025-03-31 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Abby Connect**

**Pain point:** Billed for spam calls and phone ringing time; $300/month for Google Calendar integration; wrong timezone scheduling; got addresses wrong; constant upselling.
*User type: business_owner*

> What a terrible experience.

1. They billed us for spam calls
2. They billed us for time where the phone is ringing
3. They tried to charge us $300/month to use Google Calendar instead of Calendly
4. They were scheduling appointments with customers in different timezones.
5. They were scheduling appointments with customers for roof estimates without even getting the customers' home address
6. They would put customers on hold for minutes at a time to "talk to the team" but never contact anyone from the team. Super weird
7. The initial sales representative from Abby quoted us something, but during onboarding kept trying to upsell us.
8. They charged us for overage charges when 70% of the minutes were spent on spam calls and the phone ringing. 

This company is abhorrent. I would avoid it like the plague.

*User type: business_owner*

> We began using AC a few months ago. The account set-up was easy and overall the service has been decent. Unfortunately, I have had to make multiple requests to have any changes done on our account. I also find it a bit frustrating that we are being charged by the min, yet cant access this information?? Because of this, we have gone over our allotted min each month and have been charged overage fees. It would be a huge help if you allowed your customers to check the usage at any point!

**Pain point:** Per-minute billing feels opaque when a forwarded-to-voicemail call consumes 7 minutes of receptionist time with no documentation of why.
*User type: business_owner*

> Ruby is very good at what they do.  I'm very glad I switched over to their services.  My only "beef" is with a minor lack of transparency.  Since Ruby charges per minute once you exceed your plan's alloted time, I find myself wondering why a call that's ostensibly forwarded to voicemail takes 7 minutes of receptionist time... and then, there's no voicemail message left.  Receptionists need to be trained a bit better to document WHY the calls are lasting so long...

### 18. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-14 | 2pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Regus**

**Pain point:** Virtual office provider promised phone answering but didn't deliver; implemented surprise per-minute charges that doubled the monthly bill even though calls were being forwarded elsewhere.
*User type: business_owner*

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

**Pain point:** Answering service has terrible billing and support, with lost calls due to setup errors and unexplained forwarding changes.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.

**Pain point:** Confusing pricing with ad hoc extra charges instead of plan upgrade suggestions; feels like they gouge busy professionals who don't have time to monitor billing.
*User type: business_owner*

> The service is great. I don't really understand the pricing and seem to get extra charges ad hoc (instead of suggestions to upgrade my plan). This process could be streamlined for busy professionals. Feels like they gouge you because they know you're busy.

Response to response:: No Clue there is an app; how to sign into the app; or what the app does...So the customer service answer is untrue. That goes with my impression of the company. Great product, and professional sounding answer to cover for a lack of meaningful help.

*User type: business_owner*

> My practice sort service from AnswerConnect and it was horrible. They don't provide the service they advertise. They outsort their service to people out of the country who lack the training. Our staff went through the training and all we requested was not done.   When we inquired why they did answer our call as instructed, we were told by Rayne that they didn't know. They are eager to collect your card and charge it but never provide the service. They use your points to do testing. We signed up for 300 minutes by day 4, 70mins was already used between 6 calls that were ours and 6 calls they had for testing. I reached and shared this observation and we were not credited back those mins. We requested for HIPAA and IVR, they charged for it but we never received those services. We had initially requested 500min before service began, they put 300 mins. That took money for the 500mins. To get my refund, no one would return emails or calls. I would discourages from using their service.

*User type: business_owner*

> Do not use Goodcall.com as they promise new members a free account forever but now they have changed their access to the voicemail access which cannot be accessed with any ease or in my case I cannot access the callers messages after using and putting out this number on many platforms with now a useless number. Now I will to loose many callers which may have become clients. GoodCall.com is now useless and has broken their word in having a free account forever. They are asking for nearly $60 per month to now access the calls for a service that can be obtained for less than $10 a month. My communication with the company said they would charge me only after the 2nd month to get access to this number which is out on platforms for more than a year of using this number which now is destroyed by a company that has broken their word.

*User type: business_owner*

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month.
2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days.
3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back!
4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

## Churn Cant Handle (32 quotes)

### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-23 | 3pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Both Alert and Smith.ai answering services are poor because random uninvested people answer calls; only suitable as overflow, not for practice areas that need to sign clients over the phone.
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve tried Alert and Smith.ai. Both suck, but Smith sucks less. It’s expensive for the industry however. 

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone. 

If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

### 2. ? — 2024-02-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect receptionists don't listen to callers, repeatedly schedule wrong time zones, and can only work off scripts without caller context, causing more work correcting errors than if calls were self-answered.
*User type: business_owner*

> It didn't work as we envisioned. There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:

Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. 

Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.

We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

### 3. ? — 2019-07-27 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents sound mechanized and don't engage callers; they fail to follow scripts, misroute calls, and drop callers after long holds.
*User type: business_owner*

> When the Agents answer the call, they are not ‘engaging’ with the caller.  The Agents sound very mechanized.  So its a give away this is an answering service.
Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls:
Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message.
Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.

I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

### 6. ? — 2015-12-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents can't access basic business info, miss appointments due to errors, calls disappear from the portal, and call recordings must be requested one-by-one with no self-service access.
*User type: business_owner*

> So far, I have experienced fewer problems with AC than I did with one of their competitors. Their service gets the job done, most of the time. They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.

Inexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.

I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionists pushed callers away by being unable to answer even simple questions like 'Do you have a website?' and couldn't pronounce the company name correctly.
*User type: business_owner*

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.

If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.

Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

*User type: business_owner*

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem"

**Pain point:** Agents couldn't follow simple processes like taking international phone numbers despite 7 emails; service cut without notice mid-weekend leaving business unreachable.
*User type: business_owner*

> This is a TRUE feedback from a VERY disappointed & furious customer.

We were looking for a 24/7 answering services for our English customers who can be anywhere in the world.
We signed with this pathetic company 10 days ago
Actually writing this comment, we don't have any working phone number or chat they decided WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to cut their “service “(we are in the middle of the week end) so our potential leads cannot join us and we have to take all our weekend to find a replacement solution with anybody off. 

We took time to write a complete written process to be followed by their agents, the first 3 days we had to explain them what to do, what to not do ( even the process is easy like a 10 years old boy can understand) but they didn't follow it even after several emails & checks by calling & chatting with them they didn’t. 

An example of a recurrent  idiot problem ? their low IQ agents cannot take INTERNATIONAL phone number standard like +XX (country) (cause our customers can be from anywhere) we sent them several emails , 7 ones on this particular point, no changes , I had to speak with 2 of their managers for nothing, guess what , no changes they still took the phone numbers like everyone is from USA (without country code) and this is a example they didn’t follow our other processes either.

Yesterday, been so furious of their incompetence to not follow a single process like this I sent them "do your job this is pathetic" or we will leave 
And then we received a 'we decide to stop'
Their agents for USA after hours  are NOT in USA , they all got Arabic names and they confirm with me (as professionals they are, you can imagine the stupidity)  that they are offshore agents (which is a shame cause our first question when it was time to select the potential supplier was “are your agents based in USA 100 %” ? ) we can pay for this no problem, answer YES : false 

So if you want your customers to not be able to join you or get complete stupid answers to their query by chat or even better receive phone number from potential leads than you cannot reach (without country code), this is the  perfect solution for bankrupt . 

we are still searching today a replacement , so it is now 3 days without phone numbers, We asked them to give a 5 days notice allows us to find an other provider > no answers and yesterday they charged us 149 USD for the chat, we asked for refund > no answers  

AVOID at all cost : a pure NIGHTMARE, those people are CLOWS

> Hi, I have a law firm with 228 five star reviews. We use Answer Connect. Recently I received a one-star review from a potential client who stated that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. This is our first one star review ever. I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.

**Pain point:** Cosmetic surgery clinic's agents were unprofessional and couldn't handle sensitive medical calls; not bilingual as promised; recordings prove poor quality.
*User type: business_owner*

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable!

**Pain point:** Scripting team couldn't understand financial business; agents were unprofessional and didn't follow scripts; 31 test calls all failed; $375 wasted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins). 

After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.

We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”. 

We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.

AnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)! They clearly do not value customers and seem more interested in collecting the names and numbers of all of your customers.

Ultimately it seems that unless you are firm who just takes simple phone appointments etc., BEWARE as AnswerConnect could really damage your business reputation.

Super upset with the whole experience.

**Pain point:** Ruby's quality nosedived post-2023 after CEO ouster, class action settlement, and system change; every call mishandled; receptionists can't follow basic scripts.
*User type: business_owner*

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.

Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.

First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  

I would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It’s horrific. You can't get anyone from their “happiness team” on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  

Their reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their "blame the customer" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.

### 16. ? — 2023-07-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm receptionists failed to follow script, gave incorrect info to leads, lost prospective clients; no response to urgent emails; cost firm revenue.
*User type: business_owner*

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.

Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.

Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. 

The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.

Frustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another "Urgent" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.

To add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.

I tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.

If you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save you

**Pain point:** Answering service agents don't follow scripts, have a quality ceiling, and lack business knowledge; recommends a dedicated remote receptionist over any agency for better outcomes.
*User type: business_owner*

> I've used conversational answering service for years. It's much better than when I started with nobody but they do have a ceiling. This service does not follow a script. They will do bookings for you but combined with them not following a script it makes quality control on the bookings difficult as they are operating without solid guardrails of what your criteria are. If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

*User type: business_owner*

> I'll admit, not answering all the incoming calls is nice. However, more times than not the answerconnect agent just takes a message and says "call back". Even some cases where information that is given to each agent was not passed along to the incoming calling client. For instance, simple questions like what are your hours, where are you located, what time do you close. In most cases this isn't acceptable. I have enjoyed the experience of the answering service its just not delivering 100%. I will be looking into other similar services to see if its any better.

*User type: business_owner*

> They have a couple of really good receptionists. They can be great if you work with one or two consistently regarding your account. But having so many receptionists, with our firm having a list of specific call handling instructions, we get a lot of errors. We gets calls forwarded to the office when a message should have been taken, and we receive messages when the call should have been forwarded. The business is a great concept, but I don't recommend it unless you just need a receptionist to answer your calls and either forward ALL of them or take a message for ALL of them. They should assign a specific number of receptionists per client or have fewer employees.

*User type: business_owner*

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.

Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off.

**Pain point:** Constant mistakes collecting emails, names, and required details; poor customer service response times; looking for a replacement.
*User type: business_owner*

> This is one of the worst services I've used as a business owner.

There are CONSTANT mistakes including:

- Collecting and submitting emails incorrectly
- Submitting names incorrectly
- Not collecting required details
- Not submitting forms

In addition to the mistakes, the customer's service is extremely poor. The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.

When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service. When I tried to reach out to her to air my grievances, she basically told me it's not her problem and to deal with support.

I believe that it's a management/operations issue rather than a specific receptionist issue, which is why I've given an extra star.

I am looking for a replacement and canceling the service.

**Pain point:** Good onboarding but implementation failed; had to triple-check all work; agents lacked critical thinking and made copy-paste errors; $600/month to review their work.
*User type: business_owner*

> UPDATE to 1 Start: Smith.si response's is a material misrepresentation of what transpired. My experience was after they answered calls for just 4 days. No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. 

To be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. 

At no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when "copying and pasting" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]

This whole “Help us help you” is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no "confirmation" that I was referred to as an "attorney" is just shameful.  

Ignoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services. I had to pay for a separate dedicated Spanish line. I have moved on to a service where all reps are actually bilingual and I get to try their service FREE!

Receptionists do not read instructions. There were multiple issues, such as scheduling telephone consults without offering in-person or virtual options; not accurately screening callers; Referring to me as an attorney (I am a Legal Document Assistant) which opens up my business for considerable liability.  

Follow-up emails sent to customers did not have a salutation or signature line. To some extent, this can be viewed it's a simple oversight, but there is an expectation of reasonableness. Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request. The fact that emails went out without a greeting or signature line is not how I wish to be presented to the public. It also explains why my c

## Churn Switched (22 quotes)

### 1. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-09 | 20pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Virtual HQ**

**Pain point:** Phone answering service missed 1 in 5 calls, clients never got the same receptionist, and existing clients were grumpy being met with an answering service instead of someone who knew them
*User type: business_owner*

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.

I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.

Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out!

*User type: business_owner*

*User type: business_owner*

> Buyer beware.  The ai actually sound like a live human.  That’s what got my attention.  The actual humans behind them not so great.   
I quickly realized this wasn’t what we were looking for and canceled but was then contacted by Jorge, an associate at Smith Ai.  He said I could try it risk free for 30 days and suggested an onboarding call to show us how to train and use our Ai. We agreed and tried it for a couple weeks but there are just too many kinks needing worked out still.  We ended up losing too many calls.  I emailed right away to cancel again and got a reply explaining that I now needed to give them 30 days notice again and cancel again and pay for a whole additional month.  
I would be very wary, don’t trust what they tell you. Dishonest sales associates.

**Pain point:** Script changes require days of back-and-forth; agents follow scripts robotically without common sense; decided to bring call handling in-house despite cost.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is getting frustrating
They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled.
Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back.
This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility.
Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time. 
The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in.
We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

*User type: business_owner*

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.

They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.

I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.

I went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.

*User type: business_owner*

> Smith.ai used to be fantastic, they have been our answering service of choice for over 8 years. Within the last year their quality has declined significantly. Their departments are unorganized, there's no ownership for handling actual customer issues, response time on the back end is significantly delayed. Ironically, attempting to talk with someone who has any authority to make a decision is impossible. Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more likely a canned or ai generated email with be received instead.

## Blocker Trust (2 quotes)

### 1. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-06 | 5pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY

**Pain point:** AI tools are not ready for full PI intakes yet because clients aren't comfortable talking to them; a receptionist can take the first call but a human paralegal should qualify the lead
*User type: business_owner*

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

*User type: business_owner*

> As others have said, we don’t let prospects book online because not everyone who thinks they are a prospect are suited to work with us.  They need to be vetted first.  
We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren’t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can’t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.  Now if the firm isn’t returning your call, that is on them.

**Pain point:** Brokerage was nervous about AI handling calls where deals start, but gradually transitioned from after-hours to all calls; AI freed team for higher-value work, improved follow-ups, and accelerated growth.
*User type: business_owner*

> We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.

We started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.

What surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.

Since making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.

Since then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.

We would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.

**Pain point:** Answering service owner argues IVR is terrible for first-time callers seeking high-dollar services; the industry is littered with terrible cheap answering services that lose leads
*User type: vendor*

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

> I used [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) - they were fine, but very new when I used them (2014-2015 I think). The main issue is that the receptionists were work from home, so call quality and background noise.

Then I used Gabbyville - they were good too, and I don't really remember why I left.

Finally, I used Ruby.  I highly, highly recommend. They were a bit more expensive, but well worth the cost. Plus they really tried to be one of the team (at least twice I said direct my calls to voicemail because I was ill, and they would send me a care package).

They have helped improve my workflow by mitigating calls on my behalf. We have also had a better rate of return on gaining more consultations and potential clients since hiring Ruby. Previously, many calls were missed or people would not leave voicemails, and we were missing out on a lot of potential leads. They also update your company's information quickly to be able to better assist clients and leads.

*User type: business_owner*

> I was blown away by the lengthy, articulate and expansively descriptive email response Ruby sent me regarding assessment of the intake calls process.  Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn’t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors.

*User type: business_owner*

> Reasonable service for price. To be clear the AI isn't the favorite of our clients. However, it does an adequate job of capturing data from callers and forwarding them to the correct person. At this time it's an ok fit for law firms but could be better. Improvements include specifically allowing for better instructions for the AI to immediately forward court calls to the relevant attorney. The pricing on this is a little high vs. the quality of the AI but not overly high. Smith AI compensates me for this review.

Wish it was cheap like around $130 but they've been gradually raising their prices if you cancel and opt back in you get the higher prices.

Good experienced at taking calls. You have to test to make sure your scripts and flow are being used correctly. 

Also bots tend to call, so you got to have someone monitor it and tell them to block it...they need to have an automatic bot message blocking function for free. It's using our precious minutes

**Pain point:** 24/7 availability is transformative for emergency restoration business; receptionists qualify leads and route calls, saving countless hours; flat-rate per-call pricing is predictable with no charges for blocked spam
*User type: business_owner*

> As a boutique restoration and remodeling firm serving high-value clients throughout Orange County, we needed a phone solution that matched our commitment to excellence. Smith.ai has exceeded our expectations by delivering professional, polished service that resonates with our discerning clientele from the very first contact. Their trained virtual receptionists understand our business and represent our brand flawlessly, providing the white-glove experience our clients expect, whether they're calling about a middle-of-the-night water emergency or planning a luxury kitchen remodel.

The 24/7 availability has been transformative for our emergency response business. Water damage, fire, and mold don't respect business hours, and Smith.ai ensures we never miss a critical call. Beyond just answering, their receptionists intelligently qualify leads, gather essential project details, and route calls appropriately, saving our team countless hours while ensuring every caller receives immediate, knowledgeable assistance. The seamless calendar integration mean appointments are scheduled in real-time and nothing falls through the cracks during our busiest periods.

What truly sets Smith.ai apart is delivering enterprise-level phone coverage without the overhead of hiring multiple in-house receptionists.

For Sparkle Restoration, Smith.ai isn't just an answering service;  it's a strategic partner that allows us to maintain our boutique approach while providing the responsiveness and professionalism our clients deserve.

**Pain point:** Business owner feared AI company impact on customers but AI assistant handles calls according to preset standards, transfers to live person when needed, and provides detailed email transcriptions; couldn't afford a sales team so this was the solution
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve been using Smith AI for the last four months. I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn’t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don’t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.

We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers.
