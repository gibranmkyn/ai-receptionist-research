**Pain point:** Solo lawyer's top priority is a good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate intake into CRM -- this is a bigger pain point than invoicing.
*User type: business_owner*

> TBH You’re barking up the wrong tree.  If I had to pick my top five pressure points as a solo, invoicing would come in about 14th. This is a solved problem. How about: 

1. A good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate my intake into CRM. 

2. 	Workflow automation – making documents and tasks move without manual chasing.

3.	Client follow-through – getting clients to sign, fund, or comply.

4.	Template management and formatting – preserving exact legal formatting in Word or PDFs.

**Pain point:** Lawyer sees AI's potential to be a virtual receptionist, virtual paralegal, and virtual associate, but it's not there yet due to hallucination issues.
*User type: business_owner*

> Yes - I have seen it hallucinate  - and it disguises it very well

I have a lot of automation in place as it is - but AI will unlock much more I think.  It will be like having a virtual receptionist, a virtual paralegal, a virtual associate.  Someday.

**Pain point:** All AI receptionists demoed so far haven't been good enough for prime time, but could serve as overflow/nights/weekends since they're still better than voicemail.
*User type: business_owner*

> Figure out how to try the AI receptionist before any long term commitments. 

All the ones we demo have not been good enough for prime time, but they can serve a purpose for overflow/nights/weekends. Meaning they are still better than voicemail. 

I’ve never demoed the one mentioned in this thread. I thought the tech wasn’t quite there yet, but maybe it is just the deployment of said tech.

**Pain point:** Solo attorney wants to hire a virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but hasn't yet; currently uses a text service workaround to avoid phone interruptions
*User type: business_owner*

> This is why I say I work remotely at home and only have office hours by appointment only. Sometimes I’m actually working at my office. But no one can just walk in or drop in. It’s an executive suite with a keypad that people need to know the password to get in. No one knows my password except for me and my husband (who sometimes acts like my assistant).   I have had people call and say they’re at my office and they need to drop off paperwork for me to look at etc and they aren’t even clients - I’ve never even heard of them before. I dealt with this problem but hiring a text service that responds to customer inquiries from my website or text with an invitation to schedule a paid consult. I also want to hire some kind of remote or virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but I don’t have this yet. I usually just text them after they leave a voicemail and tell them all potential client inquiries are handled via text. Then when they text me back my text service takes it from there.   I have 4 kids and 7 pets and a lot of hobbies. I take weightlifting classes and teach Zumba classes for my physical and mental health. I also have plenty of clients I’m working for already. I’m not giving up more than two minutes of my time to anyone else for free. It takes me two minutes to text potential clients who call and tell them to text instead. If they don’t want to follow my system and book a paid consult via text then I don’t want to have to talk to them and I certainly don’t want to have to see them at my office in person!

### 5. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-10 | 8pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **OpenPhone**

**Pain point:** Solo attorney says you don't need an answering service; with Google Workspace, OpenPhone, and Squarespace you can run a functional firm for $40/month without one
*User type: business_owner*

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

### 6. r/LawFirm — 2024-09-25 | 5pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **RingCentral**

**Pain point:** Attorney argues firms are obsessed with having someone answer the phone but everyone expects an auto attendant; says you don't need a receptionist, just get staff who handle daily tasks
*User type: consultant*

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

**Pain point:** AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road but isn't ready for prime time yet; advises keeping W-2 headcount to a minimum and looking at AI solutions
*User type: business_owner*

> I would try to increase the commercial side and raise your commercial rates.  The residential stuff is, as you know, highly commoditized and really hard to increase revenue without getting a chunk of the title business. (That said, my real estate practice has always been 100% commercial.) 

If you need to add staff, I would be looking offshore and at potential AI solutions. AI can draft a lot of your closing documents, for instance although you probably have software to do that efficiently. I haven’t yet found it ready for prime time but AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road. I think it’ll be ready soon if it isn’t yet. I would keep your W-2 headcount to a minimum.

### 8. r/Dentistry — 2024-12-01 | 2pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** AI phone call handling for dental practices is promising for handling missed calls and waitlist fill-ups, but practice owners want to see it work first before committing.
*User type: vendor*

> I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.

From what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.

Any sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.

Another hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.

If anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.

AI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.
