### 1. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-09 | 20pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Virtual HQ**

**Pain point:** Phone answering service missed 1 in 5 calls, clients never got the same receptionist, and existing clients were grumpy being met with an answering service instead of someone who knew them
*User type: business_owner*

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

### 2. r/LawFirm — 2024-01-07 | 11pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby**

**Pain point:** Ruby used as overflow for 500 calls/month but people can still tell the difference between in-house staff and the call service, and conversions are much better with own people answering
*User type: business_owner*

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish. 

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

*User type: business_owner*

> We dropped Smith.ai for the same reason. The first few client complaints I ignored because I thought “clients can be tough” but after the 4th complaint I realized it was not the clients but actually Smith.ai. We moved to Ruby with no complaints so far.

**Pain point:** Dropped Smith.ai after two years because they became more expensive and charge per call; switched to AnswerConnect which charges per minute and is much cheaper
*User type: business_owner*

> Used smith.ai for about two years. They were great, but became more expensive. Plus they charge you per call, which I'm not a fan of. So I switched to answerconnect. Much cheaper since they charge per minute. YMMV since I only use the answering service to get extremely basic information from the client and the calls just don't take very long.

### 5. ? — 2025-12-26 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** 24/7 availability is transformative for emergency restoration business; receptionists qualify leads and route calls, saving countless hours; flat-rate per-call pricing is predictable with no charges for blocked spam
*User type: business_owner*

> As a boutique restoration and remodeling firm serving high-value clients throughout Orange County, we needed a phone solution that matched our commitment to excellence. Smith.ai has exceeded our expectations by delivering professional, polished service that resonates with our discerning clientele from the very first contact. Their trained virtual receptionists understand our business and represent our brand flawlessly, providing the white-glove experience our clients expect, whether they're calling about a middle-of-the-night water emergency or planning a luxury kitchen remodel.

The 24/7 availability has been transformative for our emergency response business. Water damage, fire, and mold don't respect business hours, and Smith.ai ensures we never miss a critical call.

The seamless calendar integration mean appointments are scheduled in real-time and nothing falls through the cracks during our busiest periods.

What truly sets Smith.ai apart is delivering enterprise-level phone coverage without the overhead of hiring multiple in-house receptionists.

For Sparkle Restoration, Smith.ai isn't just an answering service;  it's a strategic partner that allows us to maintain our boutique approach while providing the responsiveness and professionalism our clients deserve. 

Highly recommended for any service business where first impressions and rapid response matter.

### 6. ? — 2025-11-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Business owner feared AI company impact on customers but AI assistant handles calls according to preset standards, transfers to live person when needed, and provides detailed email transcriptions; couldn't afford a sales team so this was the solution
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve been using Smith AI for the last four months. I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn’t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don’t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.

**Pain point:** Pest control business owner impressed that AI voice assistant sounds realistic; customers are shocked it is AI, and spam filtering plus instant email delivery of messages is a key benefit.
*User type: business_owner*

> I hired Smith Ai to assist me with handling calls for my pest control business. I started with the AI voice assistant option before going straight to the live agent plan. I was impressed at how real the AI rep sounded and so have my customers so far. I have received nothing but compliments so far and the callers have been shocked that its really Ai vs a live message and how quick I returned their call. Smith delivers the message immediately after the call ends via email. Another plus is how they can filter and block spam calls! The dashboard allows me to view, mark and block calls too. So far so good!

*User type: business_owner*

> We have met with several AI receptionist providers and even entered into a couple of contracts, but ultimately found that their products just couldn’t quite adapt to what we needed and were much more expensive on top of it. Dialzara is by far the best and most user-friendly option we’ve come across. The owner of the company did a zoom call with me and took the time to send a 20-minute follow up video specific to our account to make sure we were comfortable with making our own changes in the future.

*User type: business_owner*

> I have been investing real estate over 35 years. I have bought around 1,000 properties in 12 different states. 
I have tried multiple A.I. agent receptionist for my real estate business and all have failed except Dialzara. Not only is the technology superior to anything else I have found but the support and CS is better than anything else I have experienced. I love it! Not to mention I am now saving over $1,000 a month by cancelling my answering service! Go ahead and sign up for Business Plus.

### 11. ? — 2025-12-30 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **My AI Front Desk**

**Pain point:** Brokerage was nervous about AI handling calls where deals start, but gradually transitioned from after-hours to all calls; AI freed team for higher-value work, improved follow-ups, and accelerated growth.
*User type: business_owner*

> We were honestly pretty nervous about rolling out an AI to handle calls for our brokerage. Calls are where deals start, and the idea of an AI answering instead of a person felt risky. We also worried it might feel impersonal or frustrate clients.

We started by testing it slowly and eventually moved a large portion of our call handling from staff to Frontdesk AI. Our assigned customer manager met us weekly and we gradually went from answering just after hour calls to all calls. That decision ended up freeing our team to focus on higher value work instead of constantly chasing inbound calls.

What surprised us most is that it actually feels like an extension of our team rather than a tool. It answers every call consistently, asks the right qualifying questions, and routes leads exactly how we want. We were able to customize scripts by office, inquiry type, and after hours behavior without needing technical help. We've actually named our AI, we all call her Stacy internally.

Since making the switch, we miss far fewer calls, follow ups are more consistent, and response times are faster. Our agents are spending time on real conversations and deals instead of basic intake. It is very clear that we are growing faster because of this change.

Since then, we've added on chatbot and we use the CRM quite a bit. We're planning to roll out the outbound feature to call back no-shows and do meeting reminders, which we're quite excited about. The Frontdesk team has really built a whole suite of AI tools, not just one.

We would strongly recommend this to brokerages that are hesitant about AI but want to scale without constantly adding headcount.

**Pain point:** Previously relied on voicemail with voice-to-text email and customers hated the menu-based system; switching to live receptionist improved communication so much they had to increase minutes twice.
*User type: business_owner*

> We are using Ruby to handle after-hours and weekend calls only. Prior to trying Ruby, we relied on the customer to leave a voicemail. These then went to a voice-to-text email. The system was less than impressive and customers hated using a menu-based system. Since switching to Ruby, our customers appreciate talking to a live person on the first ring. The operators know when to forward a priority call. We've already had to increase our minutes per month and we're maxing that out already. Our communication and outreach to the customer has been great. And the messages we receive are much more detailed than before. We're happy we made this switch.

### 13. ? — 2025-03-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Previous call center constantly said 'we can't do that'; PATLive offered customization for call handling including scheduling, forwarding, spam marking, and CRM lead entry
*User type: business_owner*

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.

I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.

Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me—PATLive won me over from Day One!

They are hands down the best answering service I have ever worked with. My account manager Angie is always there to update any last minute changes whether it be for holiday hours or unexpected staff absences. She always gets back to me in a timely manner and makes sure all of our calls are answered professionally. Many of our clients are shocked to find out they even spoke to an answering service because of how well they answer our clients calls and questions. We couldn't imagine doing business without their assistance. They are truly part of our team and help us provide great service to our clients.

**Pain point:** Long-time Smith.ai customer (8 years) reports significant quality decline in the last year: disorganized departments, no ownership of issues, delayed responses, and impossible to reach decision-makers.
*User type: business_owner*

> Smith.ai used to be fantastic, they have been our answering service of choice for over 8 years. Within the last year their quality has declined significantly. Their departments are unorganized, there's no ownership for handling actual customer issues, response time on the back end is significantly delayed. Ironically, attempting to talk with someone who has any authority to make a decision is impossible. Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more likely a canned or ai generated email with be received instead.

Smith.ai has since done a fantastic job to help correct the issues we were experiencing, specifically when Coralyn and Christene got involved following up and continuing to ensure the accounts are updated and working correctly.

### 17. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-23 | 3pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Both Alert and Smith.ai answering services are poor because random uninvested people answer calls; only suitable as overflow, not for practice areas that need to sign clients over the phone.
*User type: business_owner*

> I’ve tried Alert and Smith.ai. Both suck, but Smith sucks less. It’s expensive for the industry however. 

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone. 

If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

*User type: business_owner*

> TBH You’re barking up the wrong tree.  If I had to pick my top five pressure points as a solo, invoicing would come in about 14th. This is a solved problem. How about: 

1. A good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate my intake into CRM. 

2. 	Workflow automation – making documents and tasks move without manual chasing.

3.	Client follow-through – getting clients to sign, fund, or comply.

4.	Template management and formatting – preserving exact legal formatting in Word or PDFs.

### 19. ? — 2024-02-06 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect receptionists don't listen to callers, repeatedly schedule wrong time zones, and can only work off scripts without caller context, causing more work correcting errors than if calls were self-answered.
*User type: business_owner*

> It didn't work as we envisioned. There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:

Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone. 

Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.

We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents sound mechanized and don't engage callers; they fail to follow scripts, misroute calls, and drop callers after long holds.
*User type: business_owner*

> When the Agents answer the call, they are not ‘engaging’ with the caller.  The Agents sound very mechanized.  So its a give away this is an answering service.
Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls:
Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message.
Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.

I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

*User type: business_owner*

> So I was happy with them for a little while until they started turning business away.  They clearly have robots working there that just read from a screen.  They need to have dedicated people to answer for each company because they simply do not understand what my company did or does and they still refused calls and also did not sound very friendly or accommodating to my clients.

### 23. ? — 2015-12-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** AnswerConnect agents can't access basic business info, miss appointments due to errors, calls disappear from the portal, and call recordings must be requested one-by-one with no self-service access.
*User type: business_owner*

> So far, I have experienced fewer problems with AC than I did with one of their competitors. Their service gets the job done, most of the time. They are a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for competent agents and reliable service. Neither of which were options at my previous answering service.

Inexperienced employees and poor training seem to be their biggest problems. Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.

I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist routinely captures wrong phone numbers, addresses, and emails; customers hang up due to painful experience; would switch if an alternative existed.
*User type: business_owner*

> They are a must have for my business.  If I found someone that was not as sloppy in execution I would switch over to them.   Yesterday for example I had one customer appointment where the phone number, address, and email were all wrong.   This routinely happens.

Today, I had a customer that I had to respell their name again because it was taken wrong (this happens frequently).

Yesterday I had a customer hang up because it was too painful to get to a point that they could tell them the available times.

If I had another option with same features and benefits, I would switch.

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionists pushed callers away by being unable to answer even simple questions like 'Do you have a website?' and couldn't pronounce the company name correctly.
*User type: business_owner*

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.

If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.

Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

**Pain point:** Charged for calls to a recycled phone number unrelated to the business, billed over $30 for internal testing during an upgrade, and lost a day of customer calls due to flawed setup.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  

I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  

Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.

The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  

Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

I know not all callers are happy to share but we can’t be guessing either.  Also had a budget in mind for what I would pay for this service and the bill has remained 7-10 times over that price every month.  I have really low expectations, just trying to survive in a sea of complications so would like to eliminate all internal obstacles.

*User type: business_owner*

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem"

*User type: business_owner*

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!

Just read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.

I quickly realized this wasn’t what we were looking for and canceled but was then contacted by Jorge, an associate at Smith Ai.  He said I could try it risk free for 30 days and suggested an onboarding call to show us how to train and use our Ai. We agreed and tried it for a couple weeks but there are just too many kinks needing worked out still.  We ended up losing too many calls.

**Pain point:** Billing errors from day one, promised HubSpot/RingCentral integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support; not worth $2,800/month.
*User type: business_owner*

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.

The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.

The HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.

The RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.

Ultimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. 

It is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says “the service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable” and “never should a client experience what you have” yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge. They only offered a credit for the future, which after this experience, we obviously would not use since I cannot recommend them at all.

*User type: business_owner*

> (SEE EDIT BELOW) Generally an okay company, but one star for questionable billing practices.  Company continues to bill us even though our service was canceled.  We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.  We're glad he responded to the review, but we wish he would have responded to our request for a refund after we were incorrectly billed after cancellation instead of doing nothing.

**Pain point:** Agents couldn't follow simple processes like taking international phone numbers despite 7 emails; service cut without notice mid-weekend leaving business unreachable.
*User type: business_owner*

> This is a TRUE feedback from a VERY disappointed & furious customer.

We were looking for a 24/7 answering services for our English customers who can be anywhere in the world.
We signed with this pathetic company 10 days ago
Actually writing this comment, we don't have any working phone number or chat they decided WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to cut their “service “(we are in the middle of the week end) so our potential leads cannot join us and we have to take all our weekend to find a replacement solution with anybody off. 

We took time to write a complete written process to be followed by their agents, the first 3 days we had to explain them what to do, what to not do ( even the process is easy like a 10 years old boy can understand) but they didn't follow it even after several emails & checks by calling & chatting with them they didn’t. 

An example of a recurrent  idiot problem ? their low IQ agents cannot take INTERNATIONAL phone number standard like +XX (country) (cause our customers can be from anywhere) we sent them several emails , 7 ones on this particular point, no changes , I had to speak with 2 of their managers for nothing, guess what , no changes they still took the phone numbers like everyone is from USA (without country code) and this is a example they didn’t follow our other processes either.

Yesterday, been so furious of their incompetence to not follow a single process like this I sent them "do your job this is pathetic" or we will leave 
And then we received a 'we decide to stop'
Their agents for USA after hours  are NOT in USA , they all got Arabic names and they confirm with me (as professionals they are, you can imagine the stupidity)  that they are offshore agents (which is a shame cause our first question when it was time to select the potential supplier was “are your agents based in USA 100 %” ? ) we can pay for this no problem, answer YES : false 

So if you want your customers to not be able to join you or get complete stupid answers to their query by chat or even better receive phone number from potential leads than you cannot reach (without country code), this is the  perfect solution for bankrupt . 

we are still searching today a replacement , so it is now 3 days without phone numbers, We asked them to give a 5 days notice allows us to find an other provider > no answers and yesterday they charged us 149 USD for the chat, we asked for refund > no answers  

AVOID at all cost : a pure NIGHTMARE, those people are CLOWS

**Pain point:** Systematic overbilling through opaque 'after-call work' charges; calls lasting 2:20 billed as 5 minutes; hundreds or thousands in overcharges with no transparency.
*User type: business_owner*

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars

As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.

They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

**Pain point:** Answering service promised 30 free calls under 30 seconds but charged for all; bill was $360 vs contracted $275 despite using fewer minutes than allotted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.

That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.

This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.

When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.

First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

I logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these "calls". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these "calls" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.

After calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the "calls" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was "only" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank "calls" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.

Charging full minutes for "calls" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.

I am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing "no response on other line" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.

*User type: business_owner*

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerConnect violated the terms. I have already forward the document to my attorney for his review. At this point, I am so insulted and upset that I do not care what this costs me to fight, but fight it I shall. Unbelievable!

> If I can give zero stars I would. Most reviews here do not seem to reflect reality of this company - certainly not mine. Probably fakes. 

We have used AC for over a year. Here is what I can tell you. Bottom of the barrel quality of receptionists. They barely read the script, let alone do anything more complicated like qualify a customer. 

THEY CHANGED OUR BILLING AND STARTED CHARGING US DOUBLE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNLESS WE HAD CAUGHT IT, IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED. SHADY SHADY PRACTICES. THE COMPANY OWNERS ARE TERRIBLE. 

They don't show you total minutes of a call so you don't see how long their staff takes on the phones.

**Pain point:** Service switched off after credit card update; forced to buy new subscription at 3.5x the price to get business line back; left without phone for 35 days.
*User type: business_owner*

> I am typically not the type that will leave a poor review. This company has severely been lacking in their customer service dept this year. They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

**Pain point:** Script changes require days of back-and-forth; agents follow scripts robotically without common sense; decided to bring call handling in-house despite cost.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is getting frustrating
They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled.
Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back.
This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility.
Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time. 
The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in.
We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

**Pain point:** Scripting team couldn't understand financial business; agents were unprofessional and didn't follow scripts; 31 test calls all failed; $375 wasted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins). 

After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.

We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”. 

We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not going to work with AnswerConnect.

AnswerConnect was NOT prepared to over even a partial refund and just suggested we try and use their dedicated agent service at a rate of $12k/ mth (for 2 staff)! They clearly do not value customers and seem more interested in collecting the names and numbers of all of your customers.

Ultimately it seems that unless you are firm who just takes simple phone appointments etc., BEWARE as AnswerConnect could really damage your business reputation.

Super upset with the whole experience.

### 48. ? — 2025-10-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm grew and Ruby started dropping calls of potential and existing clients; charged for dropped calls; forced to stay 26 more days costing $1,100 after cancellation.
*User type: business_owner*

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.

UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.

### 49. ? — 2024-01-26 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Ruby's quality nosedived post-2023 after CEO ouster, class action settlement, and system change; every call mishandled; receptionists can't follow basic scripts.
*User type: business_owner*

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.

Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.

First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  

I would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It’s horrific. You can't get anyone from their “happiness team” on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  

Their reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their "blame the customer" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.

### 50. ? — 2023-07-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm receptionists failed to follow script, gave incorrect info to leads, lost prospective clients; no response to urgent emails; cost firm revenue.
*User type: business_owner*

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.

Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.

Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. 

The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.

Frustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another "Urgent" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.

To add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.

I tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.

If you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save you

### 51. ? — 2022-12-03 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** 30-40% of calls dropped after switching from Google Voice; Clio integration doesn't work; receptionists clock inflated call times for basic info collection.
*User type: business_owner*

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.

**Pain point:** Answering service owner argues IVR is terrible for first-time callers seeking high-dollar services; the industry is littered with terrible cheap answering services that lose leads
*User type: vendor*

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

*User type: business_owner*

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers.

*User type: business_owner*

> Hire Ruby Receptionist to answer your forwarded line to Ruby. It's well worth the expense. Have Ruby collect pertinent caller info (caller name, case, matter, etc) have her forward your law related calls to you with brief caller intro from Ruby to you (where you either take the call or have her take a message or send to vm; call info then goes to you via text, email or app) & have Ruby thank all sales solicitors for their call, but you are not interested in their service or product & to please take you off you their calling / contact list immediately. Ruby is very good at dealing with sales calls if you instruct them to never put them through. We also have Ruby immediately put through anyone from the Court or their office, our bank that might be calling with a trust account issue, & other VIP callers.

> As others have said, we don’t let prospects book online because not everyone who thinks they are a prospect are suited to work with us.  They need to be vetted first.  
We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren’t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can’t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.  Now if the firm isn’t returning your call, that is on them.

If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist ignored explicit instructions from business owner to screen a wrong-number call, wasting time and money during a busy event.
*User type: business_owner*

> My recent engagements with Ruby Customer Service weren't what I expected. I was pretty much challenged by the representative regarding instructions I gave to the receptionist regarding someone calling inbound for the 'wrong company.' The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them. So sad that this situation could have ended differently if only the receptionist valued my words more than the callers.

**Pain point:** Per-minute billing feels opaque when a forwarded-to-voicemail call consumes 7 minutes of receptionist time with no documentation of why.
*User type: business_owner*

> Ruby is very good at what they do.  I'm very glad I switched over to their services.  My only "beef" is with a minor lack of transparency.  Since Ruby charges per minute once you exceed your plan's alloted time, I find myself wondering why a call that's ostensibly forwarded to voicemail takes 7 minutes of receptionist time... and then, there's no voicemail message left.  Receptionists need to be trained a bit better to document WHY the calls are lasting so long...

*User type: business_owner*

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

**Pain point:** Smith.ai works well for solo lawyer with simple call routing: new clients get scheduled, existing clients get messages, urgent calls get transferred; but warns it won't scale for high call volumes.
*User type: business_owner*

> Maximumlawyer: I'm not a regular listener, but I was thinking through intake processes and those episodes were pretty good.

[Smith.ai](https://Smith.ai): You have to keep your instructions and process simple enough that anyone can follow instructions. This is because any one of their employees might answer the phone, and they'll be looking at your instructions on a screen when they do so. 

They will schedule on a calendar of your choice, or integrate with Clio for intake. They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!

I've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.

So far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.

*User type: business_owner*

> I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.

*User type: business_owner*

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.

Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off.

There are CONSTANT mistakes including:

- Submitting names incorrectly

In addition to the mistakes, the customer's service is extremely poor. The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.

When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service. When I tried to reach out to her to air my grievances, she basically told me it's not her problem and to deal with support.

*User type: business_owner*

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.

They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.

I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.

*User type: business_owner*

> UPDATE to 1 Start: Smith.si response's is a material misrepresentation of what transpired. My experience was after they answered calls for just 4 days. No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. 

To be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. 

At no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when "copying and pasting" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]

This whole “Help us help you” is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no "confirmation" that I was referred to as an "attorney" is just shameful.  

Ignoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services. I had to pay for a separate dedicated Spanish line. I have moved on to a service where all reps are actually bilingual and I get to try their service FREE!

Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request.

If you have the patience, you will be told they can't help with the problem and provide another number to go through the exact same process again.

*User type: business_owner*

> Do not use Goodcall.com as they promise new members a free account forever but now they have changed their access to the voicemail access which cannot be accessed with any ease or in my case I cannot access the callers messages after using and putting out this number on many platforms with now a useless number. Now I will to loose many callers which may have become clients. GoodCall.com is now useless and has broken their word in having a free account forever. They are asking for nearly $60 per month to now access the calls for a service that can be obtained for less than $10 a month. My communication with the company said they would charge me only after the 2nd month to get access to this number which is out on platforms for more than a year of using this number which now is destroyed by a company that has broken their word.

Eventually I had to cancel my credit card to stop the recurring payments. Ruby continued to bill me for six months after that (always declined, of course), and then surprised me by sending me to a collections agency.

Absolutely deceptive billing practices - do NOT use this company.

*User type: business_owner*

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month.
2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days.
3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back!
4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

I cancelled the service that day.

The truth of the matter is that their prices have increased significantly, and the quality of service decreased even more.

### 130. r/LawFirm — 2024-07-27 | 10pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Solo attorney wants to hire a virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but hasn't yet; currently uses a text service workaround to avoid phone interruptions
*User type: business_owner*

> This is why I say I work remotely at home and only have office hours by appointment only. Sometimes I’m actually working at my office. But no one can just walk in or drop in. It’s an executive suite with a keypad that people need to know the password to get in. No one knows my password except for me and my husband (who sometimes acts like my assistant).   I have had people call and say they’re at my office and they need to drop off paperwork for me to look at etc and they aren’t even clients - I’ve never even heard of them before. I dealt with this problem but hiring a text service that responds to customer inquiries from my website or text with an invitation to schedule a paid consult. I also want to hire some kind of remote or virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but I don’t have this yet. I usually just text them after they leave a voicemail and tell them all potential client inquiries are handled via text. Then when they text me back my text service takes it from there.   I have 4 kids and 7 pets and a lot of hobbies. I take weightlifting classes and teach Zumba classes for my physical and mental health. I also have plenty of clients I’m working for already. I’m not giving up more than two minutes of my time to anyone else for free. It takes me two minutes to text potential clients who call and tell them to text instead. If they don’t want to follow my system and book a paid consult via text then I don’t want to have to talk to them and I certainly don’t want to have to see them at my office in person!

**Pain point:** Solo attorney says you don't need an answering service; with Google Workspace, OpenPhone, and Squarespace you can run a functional firm for $40/month without one
*User type: business_owner*

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

**Pain point:** Solo attorney lists Ruby virtual receptionist as an expense alongside malpractice insurance, Lexis, and other overhead costs, showing answering services are a meaningful cost burden
*User type: business_owner*

> Not for me.  I worked harder and made less.  Even more work was not billable, and I couldn’t justifiably bill at my prior firm rate ($100/hr less).  Plus, I had significantly more expenses (office, malpractice insurance, internet, Lexis, billing system, CPA, taxes, Ruby virtual receptionist, LawPay, CLEs and memberships, bar dues, computer and printer/copier systems, website design and hosting, advertising, and a coverage attorney contractor for hearings that conflicted or for assistance when I was swamped).  Plus, I had a wider range of less reliable clients that resulted in a reduced collection rate and more time and effort to be paid fully.  Also, my personal health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance, 401k retirement savings, paid vacation, and other benefits were gone.  It wasn’t easy and resulted in a net about $20k less than I made at the firm and no vacation, which was fine for me until I got married and had a child.  Some years were better and I made more than at the firm, but never more than 10-15% more and always with way more hassle.  #freedom

### 134. r/LawFirm — 2024-11-22 | 5pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Consultant recommends Smith.ai or Ruby Reception for call answering as part of ideal small firm tech stack, alongside Lawmatics for intake automation
*User type: consultant*

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

### 136. r/LawFirm — 2024-09-25 | 5pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **RingCentral**

**Pain point:** Attorney argues firms are obsessed with having someone answer the phone but everyone expects an auto attendant; says you don't need a receptionist, just get staff who handle daily tasks
*User type: consultant*

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

**Pain point:** AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road but isn't ready for prime time yet; advises keeping W-2 headcount to a minimum and looking at AI solutions
*User type: business_owner*

> I would try to increase the commercial side and raise your commercial rates.  The residential stuff is, as you know, highly commoditized and really hard to increase revenue without getting a chunk of the title business. (That said, my real estate practice has always been 100% commercial.) 

If you need to add staff, I would be looking offshore and at potential AI solutions. AI can draft a lot of your closing documents, for instance although you probably have software to do that efficiently.

She understood exactly what we were trying to achieve and made sure every detail was handled correctly. Her communication was outstanding, her follow-through was flawless, and she made what could have been a complicated process feel smooth and effortless.

It’s rare these days to find support teams that combine technical competence with genuine care for the customer experience, and AnswerConnect absolutely delivered. 

Because of the professionalism and dedication of Gabrielle, Tracy, and Ruth, we now have a support setup we’re truly confident in.

Highly recommended!

**Pain point:** Solo lawyer pays ~$100/month for a live remote receptionist during working hours on top of RingCentral, having evolved through multiple phone setups over decades to simplify operations.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

### 185. r/LawFirm — 2025-07-14 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Law firm uses overseas remote worker as receptionist to route calls and schedule intake, with all calls needing to be scheduled rather than live-answered.
*User type: business_owner*

> Receptionist - overseas remote worker. All calls with OC/clients needs to be scheduled (we use zoom for phones). I don't drop what I'm doing to answer calls (unless there's an emergency).

If the call is from a potential new client, reception routes to Intake, another overseas position.

If new client is qualified, Intake schedules call with salesperson. We use Clio Grow for new clients, but it sucks and I wouldn't recommend it.

Via Clio Grow, new client gets series of emails reminding of appointment, letting them know what to expect ect.

Salesperson uses clio grow to draft template agreement. Clio manage captures payment.

Case is converted to Clio manager where we open template file.

I use notion to outline, step by step, sometimes in painful detail, who does what when for every time of project we might be working on (okay, not every project, I'm still working on it).

Every month, legal team uses chatGPT to send client monthly email update. This is as much for me as the team -- I compare month over month to see if case is moving forward.

Case ends with formal closing procedures.

  
OP, the actual software you use does not matter. That's the least important part. Attorneys will argue forever about what software is "best." The reality is that they are all a shit sandwich. You just need to decide which shit sandwich tastes less shitty than the rest.

The KEY to running a successful, well-run, profitbale business is having SYSTEMS in place and holding the team accountable to those systems. You can write the systems on a napkin and copy them for the team. It doesn't matter. It just needs to be written down and you need to hold the team accountable to those systems you design.

### 186. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-29 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Hiring a full receptionist is costly for a solo attorney; outsourcing phone answering to a provider can be much cheaper and available 24/7.
*User type: business_owner*

> “Outsourcing” is a vague term. That’s why this question can’t be answered. 

Potential meanings of outsourcing:

* what you said, giving work to firm B when you have too much work
* hiring temporary attorneys to do legal work. There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work
* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn’t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly. Hiring a provider to answer your phone can be much cheaper and be 24/7.
* you can outsource things like intake or generating social media posts/blog posts, etc.

### 187. r/LawFirm — 2024-03-14 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **LEX Reception**

**Pain point:** Family lawyer uses LEX Reception for intake but is not a massive fan and plans to move away from them.
*User type: business_owner*

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu

**Pain point:** Answering service vendor explains they use AI under the hood so human receptionists can focus on conversation rather than reading scripts and typing, enabling faster call summaries and better qualification.
*User type: vendor*

> Hi! Thank you so much for the kind words. For the human answering service, we use AI under the hood so the receptionists can focus on the conversation, not on reading a script and typing. It also allows us to get you your call summaries more quickly (they write themselves based on the data), to qualify callers more precisely, things like that.

**Pain point:** Solo attorney spends ~$1,200/mo on tech stack including answering service integrated with Lawmatics for intake, considers it worthwhile compared to hiring an employee.
*User type: business_owner*

> Lawmatics (tracking leads, costs per lead, cost per client, fee agreements, calendar links)—> Clio (billing, logging emails, case notes, client contact info, texting, receiving documents) —> jubilee for bankruptcy or WealthCounsel for estate planning. Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

*User type: consultant*

> Very interesting insight. I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers. I honestly think in the next 15-20 years that having a real person answer the phone will make any company stand out.

**Pain point:** AI phone call handling for dental practices is promising for handling missed calls and waitlist fill-ups, but practice owners want to see it work first before committing.
*User type: vendor*

> I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.

From what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.

Any sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.

Another hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.

If anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.

AI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.

**Pain point:** Describes the ideal receptionist call flow: answer, get name, warm transfer to attorney, take message if unavailable, book consultation for new clients to prevent them calling the next firm.
*User type: consultant*

> Agreed, it should never be this way. I ran a firm for years before switching to back-office support services. The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for "the benefit of the firm's KPIs."

It needs to be simple:

- Incoming call
- Answer
- Name
- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. 
- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. 
- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. 

The firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. 

If your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.

(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  


(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.

Random Story:

I love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a "steak knife salesman" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.

*User type: business_owner*

> Jaikishan did a great job of giving the tour but getting it scheduled was very difficult. I was connecting through the chat on the app for days with no response. Then when I emailed and scheduled a call with Tim Goddard-Hill, he said he would call me at the time of meeting and he never called so I had to reach out to finally get connected with someone. The Answer Connect team was responsive in trying to earn our business but now that we are clients I have not received great customer service.

Despite asking a very simple question, I received no helpful answers. Instead, the ruby's live chat agent repeatedly asked the same questions, clearly not paying attention to my responses. This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.

The agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs? Given the high price they charge, I expected much better. Sadly, their service falls far below even the most basic standards. I would not recommend Ruby Live Receptionist to anyone looking for reliable and respectful service.

When the person answered, I couldn't understand what they said.

When I attempted to cancel the service, I waited 7 min. on hold for Customer Service before hanging up and trying again. 

I called again and waited 4 min. before hanging up and trying again.

When I did reach someone, it took over 10 min. to cancel the service, and, they wanted to charge me another 33$...on top of the set-up charge and monthly charges I had already paid.

Please make certain I am not charged 33$.

Thank You.

**Pain point:** Charged for unrelated calls during free trial; no web panel for managing service; billed after cancellation with pay-to-cancel requirement.
*User type: business_owner*

> Be careful about them, scam and fraud possible.

We registered for their free trial service, they wrote on their website you can try 14 days for free. After the setup, I can't find the things they promoted on the website about the features and capabilities. All things they promoted handled manually, they have not any web panel for managing your service.
Also, they charge you for any call they receive, it's mean they receive many calls not related to your business, they will charge you for nothing.

Finally after a few hours, decided to go for another service.
Their stupid email started from the next day, about setup the account, after some day, 
about some calls we received at the number, we didn't use at all (they have a robot or some fake caller) 
finally, after 2 weeks they sent the invoice and said you should pay for trial service you didn't use it at all.
They really changed the free trial service meaning on the internet.

After received many calls and email from them, I sent an email to them and asked, please stop sending and calling and terminate that stupid thing.
Someone from their company replied you should pay to cancel

I plan to buy a Lenovo laptop or something g similar from Costco for $500 or so in the near future. 

I’m working from home and using conference space at my accountant’s office if ever needed. Most of my meetings and closings are remote.

### 250. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-20 | 11pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Solo attorney advises getting a virtual office with a live receptionist who can answer phones, receive mail, and greet clients as essential infrastructure
*User type: business_owner*

> A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: 

First, get a "virtual office" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. 

Second, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. 

Third, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. 

Finally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.

You don't need Calendly (Clio Grow has most of that functionality). You don't need ClickUp (Clio Manage has a better task management).

  
Consider getting a virtual receptionist service within 3 months, but you don't need it immediately.

### 315. r/LawFirm — 2023-03-06 | 4pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Law firm uses an answering service for inbound intake requests that provides brief matter summaries, helping manage overflow from a busy practice.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

*User type: business_owner*

> Good luck! I would rec Ringcentral because of call forwarding. Hopefully your phone blows up after you leave and you have a ton of intake calls. Conditional call forwarding is when you don't pick up for a few rings, and on the LAST ring it goes to a different number (like an answering service). Make sure you have access to conditional call forwarding so that you can hire a receptionist or call answering service if you need one!

### 321. r/LawFirm — 2025-04-23 | 3pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Solo lawyer suggests considering an answering service to present a bigger outward appearance, though he personally does not use one.
*User type: business_owner*

> Here are my suggestions with some reasons.

Use WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.

Get at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.

For bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.

Consider having an answering service to present a "bigger" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.

For hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:

Printer with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.

Sheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.

Get a flatbed scanner if you need it.

Get fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.

Get a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.

Get a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.

Software oriented tools:

Please read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)

Notice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the à la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.

Of course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.

You need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with

*User type: vendor*

> We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)

Hey everyone! We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist vendor pitches services to a law firm: answering calls, setting appointments, routing calls, and handling after-hours coverage as advantages over hiring in-house.
*User type: vendor*

> You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. 

Since your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.

### 331. r/LawFirm — 2025-01-11 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Solo PI attorney launching a firm includes Smith.ai in their tech stack for receptionist services as part of startup costs.
*User type: business_owner*

> I just got done launching my solo PI firm this first week of 2025! Thank you for this list, I definitely referenced it a few times. I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:

1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my "finalist" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer "office" over "firm".

2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my "finalist" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, "first.lastinjurylawoffice.com" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. 

3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. 

4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. "Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert." If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. 

5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. 

6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free

7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) 

8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. 

9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. 

10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. 

11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. 

12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.

*User type: consultant*

> I’m not a lawyer, I’m a growth strategist  and fractional CMO for lawyers/ firms and you’re getting amazing advice here. 

A few things I’d add: 

1. Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.
2. Make sure there’s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.
3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. 
4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.
5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc 
6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority 
7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it 

Once you’ve got some clients going and you want more or you’ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there’s advanced marketing strategies I’d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. 

I’m excited for you. I hope it goes well!

### 333. r/VOIP — 2024-08-23 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Cloud-based answering service or call center solutions are more cost-effective and flexible than on-premise PBX systems for handling business calls.
*User type: consultant*

> Either a cloud based phone system with a cloud based SIP phone service provider or a cloud based answering service or call center type solution would remove a lot of the limitations you currently have. It seems the rules of this sub say that I can’t recommend products or services so I guess that’s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There’s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!

### 334. r/LawFirm — 2025-07-07 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Consultant advises new solo PI attorney to consider Ruby Receptionist or virtual assistant for initial intake to avoid missing time-sensitive leads while in court.
*User type: consultant*

> Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.

From what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.

A few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.

One thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.

Also, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.

The intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.

Good luck with the new practice!
