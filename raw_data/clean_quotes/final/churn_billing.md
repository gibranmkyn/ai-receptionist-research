### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-04-04 | 6pts | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Dropped Smith.ai after two years because they became more expensive and charge per call; switched to AnswerConnect which charges per minute and is much cheaper
*User type: business_owner*

> Used smith.ai for about two years. They were great, but became more expensive. Plus they charge you per call, which I'm not a fan of. So I switched to answerconnect. Much cheaper since they charge per minute. YMMV since I only use the answering service to get extremely basic information from the client and the calls just don't take very long.

### 2. ? — 2019-01-04 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Charged for calls to a recycled phone number unrelated to the business, billed over $30 for internal testing during an upgrade, and lost a day of customer calls due to flawed setup.
*User type: business_owner*

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  

I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  

Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.

The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  

Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

**Pain point:** Answering service bill is 7-10x the expected budget; agents continually misspell names, emails, and addresses despite the critical importance of accuracy.
*User type: business_owner*

> Accurate information is extremely important.  We continually receive misspelled names, emails, addresses from the agents.  I know not all callers are happy to share but we can’t be guessing either.  Also had a budget in mind for what I would pay for this service and the bill has remained 7-10 times over that price every month.  I have really low expectations, just trying to survive in a sea of complications so would like to eliminate all internal obstacles.  We are stubbornly hanging on hoping for better results out of this engagement.  I give it average but I have nothing to compare it too except our own or previous office staff.

**Pain point:** AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without consent raising the bill; settings don't save; cancellation process is intentionally difficult.
*User type: business_owner*

> The AI receptionist transfers calls to live agents without my consent which will raise my bill. Does not save settings. Super dishonest business. Cannot cancel. They make you email to request cancellation!! I had to dig for their phone number only to talk to a receptionist who can't cancel for me! Now I have to wait for a call and hopefully they will cancel. Never again! If you need an AI receptionist look elsewhere.

**Pain point:** Upsold to a plan costing $700/month more than needed; support was unreachable; company overcharged by over $3,000 over 5 months.
*User type: business_owner*

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!

Just read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.

### 6. ? — 2023-11-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Billing errors from day one, promised HubSpot/RingCentral integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support; not worth $2,800/month.
*User type: business_owner*

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.

The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.

The HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.

The RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.

Ultimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. 

It is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says “the service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable” and “never should a client experience what you have” yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge. They only offered a credit for the future, which after this experience, we obviously would not use since I cannot recommend them at all.

### 7. ? — 2023-10-02 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Continued billing after cancellation; refused refund unless credit card dispute was withdrawn; VP asked them to remove negative review.
*User type: business_owner*

> (SEE EDIT BELOW) Generally an okay company, but one star for questionable billing practices.  Company continues to bill us even though our service was canceled.  We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.  We're glad he responded to the review, but we wish he would have responded to our request for a refund after we were incorrectly billed after cancellation instead of doing nothing.

### 8. ? — 2025-09-10 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Systematic overbilling through opaque 'after-call work' charges; calls lasting 2:20 billed as 5 minutes; hundreds or thousands in overcharges with no transparency.
*User type: business_owner*

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars

As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.

They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.

Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.

In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.

When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.

I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full transparency and itemized logs for all time charged.

Until then, this company cannot be trusted to bill ethically or operate transparently.

### 9. ? — 2025-04-30 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Answering service promised 30 free calls under 30 seconds but charged for all; bill was $360 vs contracted $275 despite using fewer minutes than allotted.
*User type: business_owner*

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.

That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.

This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.

When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.

First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

I logged into the portal to see where the issue was. To my surprise, I was charged for 169 minutes. Over DOUBLE what was normal for our company. On the invoice, it showed that there were 131 calls. We maybe only received notification of 30 of these "calls". After looking through every message description in the portal, I realized less than half of these "calls" had anyone on the other line, yet I was getting charged for a full minute.

After calling customer service, I was told by Priyanka K. that 73 of the "calls" had no response. Since the free 30 under 30 applied, I was "only" charged for 43 of these calls. She found 130 calls, although the invoice reported 131. Interestingly, if you subtract the 43 charged minutes of blank "calls" from the supposed 168 minutes (above says 131 calls, but if she found 1 call less, that means we would be 1 minute less), that totals to exactly 125 minutes. What we were contracted for.

Charging full minutes for "calls" with no one on the other end was NEVER communicated ANYWHERE, including our original contract, emails, and conversations that I have gone back through.

I am a reasonable human being. I understand that whether or not someone is on the other line, the person picking up the phone who has a job to do. HOWEVER, writing "no response on other line" takes 5 seconds. Not 1 full minute. I would even understand if I was rounded up to the half minute for that, but no. What is not communicated is that YOU ARE ROUNDED UP TO THE FULL MINUTE FOR ANY RINGS IN, EVEN IF THE OTHER LINE IS BLANK.

### 10. ? — 2024-11-25 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Charged by the minute while agents ask callers to spell everything 3-4 times to inflate call time; information not taken from script; told clients they weren't clients.
*User type: business_owner*

> We used these for 6 months, they charge by the minute listening to the calls they ask you to spell everything out 3 to 4 times........escalating time on the phone and charging you £1.75 a min after your package hits its limit!!!!!!! 
When we informed them numerous times their service was not acceptable by:
Information not taken from the script given or passed to the on call engineer.
Telling clients that they are not a client when our client list has been provided etc etc .........

The one star has been awarded as you can cancel the contract with them on the spot.

### 11. ? — 2023-05-01 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Bottom-of-barrel receptionist quality who barely read scripts; billing doubled without notice; call duration hidden to obscure how long staff spends on calls.
*User type: business_owner*

> If I can give zero stars I would. Most reviews here do not seem to reflect reality of this company - certainly not mine. Probably fakes. 

We have used AC for over a year. Here is what I can tell you. Bottom of the barrel quality of receptionists. They barely read the script, let alone do anything more complicated like qualify a customer. 

THEY CHANGED OUR BILLING AND STARTED CHARGING US DOUBLE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE AND UNLESS WE HAD CAUGHT IT, IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED. SHADY SHADY PRACTICES. THE COMPANY OWNERS ARE TERRIBLE. 

They don't show you total minutes of a call so you don't see how long their staff takes on the phones.

### 12. ? — 2023-03-21 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Service switched off after credit card update; forced to buy new subscription at 3.5x the price to get business line back; left without phone for 35 days.
*User type: business_owner*

> I am typically not the type that will leave a poor review. This company has severely been lacking in their customer service dept this year. They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

### 13. ? — 2025-10-14 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Law firm grew and Ruby started dropping calls of potential and existing clients; charged for dropped calls; forced to stay 26 more days costing $1,100 after cancellation.
*User type: business_owner*

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.

UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.

### 14. ? — 2022-12-03 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** 30-40% of calls dropped after switching from Google Voice; Clio integration doesn't work; receptionists clock inflated call times for basic info collection.
*User type: business_owner*

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.

**Pain point:** Billed for spam calls and phone ringing time; $300/month for Google Calendar integration; wrong timezone scheduling; got addresses wrong; constant upselling.
*User type: business_owner*

> What a terrible experience.

1. They billed us for spam calls
2. They billed us for time where the phone is ringing
3. They tried to charge us $300/month to use Google Calendar instead of Calendly
4. They were scheduling appointments with customers in different timezones.
5. They were scheduling appointments with customers for roof estimates without even getting the customers' home address
6. They would put customers on hold for minutes at a time to "talk to the team" but never contact anyone from the team. Super weird
7. The initial sales representative from Abby quoted us something, but during onboarding kept trying to upsell us.
8. They charged us for overage charges when 70% of the minutes were spent on spam calls and the phone ringing. 

This company is abhorrent. I would avoid it like the plague.

*User type: business_owner*

> We began using AC a few months ago. The account set-up was easy and overall the service has been decent. Unfortunately, I have had to make multiple requests to have any changes done on our account. I also find it a bit frustrating that we are being charged by the min, yet cant access this information?? Because of this, we have gone over our allotted min each month and have been charged overage fees. It would be a huge help if you allowed your customers to check the usage at any point!

*User type: business_owner*

> Ruby is very good at what they do.  I'm very glad I switched over to their services.  My only "beef" is with a minor lack of transparency.  Since Ruby charges per minute once you exceed your plan's alloted time, I find myself wondering why a call that's ostensibly forwarded to voicemail takes 7 minutes of receptionist time... and then, there's no voicemail message left.  Receptionists need to be trained a bit better to document WHY the calls are lasting so long...

### 18. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-14 | 2pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Regus**

**Pain point:** Virtual office provider promised phone answering but didn't deliver; implemented surprise per-minute charges that doubled the monthly bill even though calls were being forwarded elsewhere.
*User type: business_owner*

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

**Pain point:** Answering service has terrible billing and support, with lost calls due to setup errors and unexplained forwarding changes.
*User type: business_owner*

> I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.

*User type: business_owner*

> The service is great. I don't really understand the pricing and seem to get extra charges ad hoc (instead of suggestions to upgrade my plan). This process could be streamlined for busy professionals. Feels like they gouge you because they know you're busy.

Response to response:: No Clue there is an app; how to sign into the app; or what the app does...So the customer service answer is untrue. That goes with my impression of the company. Great product, and professional sounding answer to cover for a lack of meaningful help.

### 22. ? — 2024-02-01 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | Product: **AnswerConnect**

**Pain point:** Charged for overages on minutes within the plan; service turned off randomly; unreliable; different reps give different answers every call.
*User type: business_owner*

> If I could give a 0 stars I would. This company at one point was great but in the last year have completely gone down hill. They will charge you for every little thing. And they want to have your card on file so they can charge you randomly. They charged me per their invoice for going over my 200 minute plan and it said I used 172 minutes. They charged me $221 for overage charges for minutes I used that were included in my 200 minute plan. They will turn your service randomly and are 100 percent unreliable. They will promised to credit you for turning off your service and try to charge you anyway. I found a new company and since then realized how much of horrible service I received from them. You will always talk to a different person and they will all have different answers and they will say they will investigate and get back to you to just up charge for the call. Worst answering service!!

**Pain point:** Outsourced agents lacked training; used client minutes for testing; charged for HIPAA and IVR services never received; refused refund.
*User type: business_owner*

> My practice sort service from AnswerConnect and it was horrible. They don't provide the service they advertise. They outsort their service to people out of the country who lack the training. Our staff went through the training and all we requested was not done.   When we inquired why they did answer our call as instructed, we were told by Rayne that they didn't know. They are eager to collect your card and charge it but never provide the service. They use your points to do testing. We signed up for 300 minutes by day 4, 70mins was already used between 6 calls that were ours and 6 calls they had for testing. I reached and shared this observation and we were not credited back those mins. We requested for HIPAA and IVR, they charged for it but we never received those services. We had initially requested 500min before service began, they put 300 mins. That took money for the 500mins. To get my refund, no one would return emails or calls. I would discourages from using their service.

### 24. ? — 2023-12-23 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Goodcall**

**Pain point:** AI phone service broke promise of free account forever; changed access to voicemail requiring $60/month; business number now useless after a year of platform distribution.
*User type: business_owner*

> Do not use Goodcall.com as they promise new members a free account forever but now they have changed their access to the voicemail access which cannot be accessed with any ease or in my case I cannot access the callers messages after using and putting out this number on many platforms with now a useless number. Now I will to loose many callers which may have become clients. GoodCall.com is now useless and has broken their word in having a free account forever. They are asking for nearly $60 per month to now access the calls for a service that can be obtained for less than $10 a month. My communication with the company said they would charge me only after the 2nd month to get access to this number which is out on platforms for more than a year of using this number which now is destroyed by a company that has broken their word.

**Pain point:** Couldn't cancel subscription through dashboard; kept billing; had to cancel credit card; sent to collections agency after 6 months of declined charges.
*User type: business_owner*

> I was a faithful customer for many years, until I realized they were answering only a couple of calls a month. I went into my dashboard and tried to cancel my subscription, but they kept billing me.

Eventually I had to cancel my credit card to stop the recurring payments. Ruby continued to bill me for six months after that (always declined, of course), and then surprised me by sending me to a collections agency.

Absolutely deceptive billing practices - do NOT use this company.

### 26. ? — 2023-11-02 | ? | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Charged by the minute while receptionists add unnecessary hold time; billing/customer service never available; billed after cancellation.
*User type: business_owner*

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month.
2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days.
3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back!
4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

### 27. ? — 2020-04-26 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Getting charged for solicitation calls that should be filtered, and outbound caller ID doesn't show company name/number through the app.
*User type: business_owner*

> They are good, but there is not enough uniformity in training. I often get charged for solicitation calls that should not occur in the first place.

They are trying to get better. I like the app and how much I can control within it. Now that my number is hosted by Ruby, I’m kind of stuck. Also when I call out thru the app my company name and number are not appearing to clients. That needs to be fixed.

### 29. ? — 2019-08-02 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Overcharged after company name/pricing change; auto-charged credit card without consent; looking for more stable pricing.
*User type: business_owner*

> Used them for a couple years and got way overcharged recently after the service and name changed of the company.

This caused a lot of stress for me and the company. Instead of working with me on our last month being unhappy, the company autocharged the CC for a payment without me okaying it.

I hope to use a different service that doesn’t change in pricing so often and is unreliable.

**Pain point:** Charged for hang-up calls from robocallers; spam filtering solution doesn't work effectively enough to prevent billing.
*User type: business_owner*

> I am still getting many hang up calls. I thought the solution was for the caller to be required to select #6 in effort to decrease the number of robot calls but this has not resolved the problem. To be effective, the required #6 should be placed before the announcement of my name so that I am not paying for hang ups.

> Dishonest staff and an untrustworthy company. I canceled during the trial period, yet they continued charging my credit card for five months without my knowledge. They denied the cancellation, never followed up as promised, and I later discovered they have an F rating with the BBB. This company should be avoided.

*User type: business_owner*

> They keep raising the price over 3 years, looking for alternatives that would grandfather people in their prices. 

Bots call the numbers and it counts towards your minutes. They know it's bots but won't exclude it from your plan, you have to manually tell them to block those numbers.

### 34. ? — 2019-04-10 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Charged for unrelated calls during free trial; no web panel for managing service; billed after cancellation with pay-to-cancel requirement.
*User type: business_owner*

> Be careful about them, scam and fraud possible.

We registered for their free trial service, they wrote on their website you can try 14 days for free. After the setup, I can't find the things they promoted on the website about the features and capabilities. All things they promoted handled manually, they have not any web panel for managing your service.
Also, they charge you for any call they receive, it's mean they receive many calls not related to your business, they will charge you for nothing.

Finally after a few hours, decided to go for another service.
Their stupid email started from the next day, about setup the account, after some day, 
about some calls we received at the number, we didn't use at all (they have a robot or some fake caller) 
finally, after 2 weeks they sent the invoice and said you should pay for trial service you didn't use it at all.
They really changed the free trial service meaning on the internet.

After received many calls and email from them, I sent an email to them and asked, please stop sending and calling and terminate that stupid thing.
Someone from their company replied you should pay to cancel

### 35. ? — 2024-06-16 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Abby Connect**

**Pain point:** Fraudulent credit card charges continuing after multiple cancellation requests; account still active months after cancellation.
*User type: business_owner*

> Unethical company keeps fraudulently charging my credit card after I have requested to cancel multiple times. They refunded the last charge and then I got billed again today. My rep is Katherine Currah and she seems to think that she has the right to not cancel my account just because the thinks she is entitled to try to talk me into staying with the company before she cancels my account. I logged into my account today and my account is still active after canceling two months ago and after having the last charge refunded and telling them to cancel my account multiple times. This is the law straw. I am filing complaints with the BBB, Trust Pilot and the FTC. I am also filing a police reporting, reporting the fraud to the attorney general as well as filing a formal complaint on Katherine Curran with the company. I DO NOT RECOMMEND WORKING WITH THIS UNETHICAL, CRIMINAL COMPANY THAT FRAUDULENTLY CHARGES YOUR CREDIT CARD.
