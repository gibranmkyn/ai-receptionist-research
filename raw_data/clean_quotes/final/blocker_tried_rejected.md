**Pain point:** Initially hesitant about AI answering service, but customizability convinced them to try it as overflow reception; people complimented it and asked about it
*User type: business_owner*

> At first, I was hesitant to use Smith's AI Service. But when I saw how customizable it was, I decided to give it a try to use as an overflow reception service for my law firm. I was surprisingly happy. What's more, many people have complimented me and asked about it. I tell them we use"Smith"! Great experience!

### 2. r/LawFirm — 2025-12-28 | 3pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY

**Pain point:** Veteran lawyer hates virtual receptionists and claims he has lost fewer than a dozen potential clients over many years by just using voicemail and calling back within 5 minutes.
*User type: business_owner*

> A looooooong time ago I put an ad in the alternate weekly -(I cleared it with my boss) I used my cell #- and I picked up a couple of clients which I ran thru the firm and my share of the fees  more than paid for the ad. (my message did not differ much than what I use now- This is …. I am unable to answer (I am in Court) I will return your call as soon as I can.. and then I return the call in 5 minutes or less.  I hate virtual receptionists.  In all my years if I have lost more than a dozen potential clients that is a lot-ymmv

### 3. r/LawFirm — 2025-04-29 | 2pts | Quality: 4/5 | PRESENTATION-READY

**Pain point:** Lawyer rejects both answering services ('you can instantly tell and they suck') and AI voice assistants ('I hate robots and would never hire a lawyer who used them').
*User type: business_owner*

> Don't use an answering service. You can instantly tell and they suck. Definitely don't use an AI voice assistant. I hate robots and would never hire a lawyer who used them. I don't do free consultations, you get too many people lawyer-shopping. I just charge my hourly rate or $100 for 30 minutes. Weeds out the shoppers.

You are correct that it sucks when prospective clients get past the assistant and talk your ear off and then don't pay when they get what they want.

**Pain point:** Sales was aggressive about scheduling consultation but couldn't answer questions or provide working demos when things got specific.
*User type: prospect*

> Company was real big and bad about scheduling a consultation. As soon as it got remotely “outside the box” and I asked questions or asked for examples the guy stopped responding. Sent demo links that don’t work. Glad we didn’t sign.

### 5. ? — 2019-09-19 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Missed their own scheduled sales call; took 10 minutes for their own receptionist to figure out how to reach someone internally.
*User type: prospect*

> Had a meeting scheduled to discuss working with these people.  Missed the person calling me called them right back literally and was told "they were in a meeting."  Despite the fact that I had a meeting scheduled for that time.  Unbelievable.  The woman who answered the phone spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to get a hold of the person I was supposed to meet with.  If this is the way your company is run there is no freaking way I would sign up to have you manage phone calls for my business.  Seeing as how you can't manage phone calls for your own company.
