### 1. ? — 2025-10-31 | ? | Quality: 5/5 | PRESENTATION-READY | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Long-time Smith.ai customer (8 years) reports significant quality decline in the last year: disorganized departments, no ownership of issues, delayed responses, and impossible to reach decision-makers.
*User type: business_owner*

> Smith.ai used to be fantastic, they have been our answering service of choice for over 8 years. Within the last year their quality has declined significantly. Their departments are unorganized, there's no ownership for handling actual customer issues, response time on the back end is significantly delayed. Ironically, attempting to talk with someone who has any authority to make a decision is impossible. Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more likely a canned or ai generated email with be received instead. 

*Update*

Smith.ai has since done a fantastic job to help correct the issues we were experiencing, specifically when Coralyn and Christene got involved following up and continuing to ensure the accounts are updated and working correctly.

### 4. r/LawFirm — 2023-11-26 | 4pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Lawyer has tried multiple answering services and is unhappy with all of them, seeking recommendations for a virtual receptionist that integrates with Google Ads.
*User type: business_owner*

> Best virtual receptionist/google ads

Hey just wondering if 1) anyone can make a recc for an answering service they have had success with and 2) how well this worked with a google ad campaign. I’ve used a few services and am not happy with them. Any feedback greatly appreciated. Thanks.

### 5. ? — 2020-06-16 | ? | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **PATLive**

**Pain point:** Person answering was unintelligible; only received prank calls; waited 7+ minutes on hold to cancel; tried to charge additional fee to cancel.
*User type: business_owner*

> Zero Stars:
Worse Than Bad

I asked that service be started and billed after I received my first legitimate call from a customer.
This request was denied.

The only calls I received were prank calls on a daily basis and a test call from myself.

When the person answered, I couldn't understand what they said.

When I attempted to cancel the service, I waited 7 min. on hold for Customer Service before hanging up and trying again. 

I called again and waited 4 min. before hanging up and trying again.

When I did reach someone, it took over 10 min. to cancel the service, and, they wanted to charge me another 33$...on top of the set-up charge and monthly charges I had already paid.

Please make certain I am not charged 33$.

Thank You.

Respectfully- 

-Richard
