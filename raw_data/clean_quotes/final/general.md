### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-10-29 | 3pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Hiring a full receptionist is costly for a solo attorney; outsourcing phone answering to a provider can be much cheaper and available 24/7.
*User type: business_owner*

> “Outsourcing” is a vague term. That’s why this question can’t be answered. 

Potential meanings of outsourcing:

* what you said, giving work to firm B when you have too much work
* hiring temporary attorneys to do legal work. There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work
* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn’t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly. Hiring a provider to answer your phone can be much cheaper and be 24/7.
* you can outsource things like intake or generating social media posts/blog posts, etc.

### 2. r/LawFirm — 2025-07-17 | 2pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Describes the ideal receptionist call flow: answer, get name, warm transfer to attorney, take message if unavailable, book consultation for new clients to prevent them calling the next firm.
*User type: consultant*

> Agreed, it should never be this way. I ran a firm for years before switching to back-office support services. The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for "the benefit of the firm's KPIs."

It needs to be simple:

- Incoming call
- Answer
- Name
- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. 
- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. 
- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. 

The firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. 

If your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.

### 3. r/LawFirm — 2023-07-19 | 2pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** Solo PI attorney handling 70-80 cases is overwhelmed answering phones, attending court, and managing everything alone; considering first hire (receptionist vs paralegal vs associate).
*User type: business_owner*

> Thank you so much for posting this. Huge fan of BNI here as well. I went out as a solo in September and took around 50 cases from my prior firm. I am now handling around 70-80 cases with no para/assistant and between answering the phones, attending court, sending medical record requests, keeping up with discovery and making sure my clients are seeing the  PT/Orthos etc- it's getting a little hectic.  I knew a few of my big cases would pop this year and since September I have made $350k+ before taxes which is more than I have ever made- so I have some money to spend on assistance and help.  
(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  


(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.

Random Story:

I love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a "steak knife salesman" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.

### 4. r/LawFirm — 2026-01-20 | 11pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Solo attorney advises getting a virtual office with a live receptionist who can answer phones, receive mail, and greet clients as essential infrastructure
*User type: business_owner*

> A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: 

First, get a "virtual office" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. 

Second, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. 

Third, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. 

Finally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.

### 5. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-01 | 5pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Recommends getting a virtual receptionist service within 3 months of starting solo practice, positioning it as essential but not day-one infrastructure
*User type: business_owner*

> This is what I would recommend: Clio Manage & Grow, Quickbooks, Microsoft 365 (don't need co-pilot. it's expensive and I rarely use it), Zoom pro, RingCentral instead of Google Voice, JusticeText (for video management), one legal research service.

  
You don't need Calendly (Clio Grow has most of that functionality). You don't need ClickUp (Clio Manage has a better task management).

  
Consider getting a virtual receptionist service within 3 months, but you don't need it immediately.

### 6. r/LawFirm — 2024-11-25 | 3pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **RingCentral**

**Pain point:** Solo lawyer starting a firm considers call forwarding to an answering service as critical infrastructure so they don't miss intake calls.
*User type: business_owner*

> Good luck! I would rec Ringcentral because of call forwarding. Hopefully your phone blows up after you leave and you have a ton of intake calls. Conditional call forwarding is when you don't pick up for a few rings, and on the LAST ring it goes to a different number (like an answering service). Make sure you have access to conditional call forwarding so that you can hire a receptionist or call answering service if you need one!  
My first year I was SCRAPPY to save money. I practice in PI and I have most of the caselaw that I needed in motions etc so I didn't have westlaw my first year. If I needed something, I went to the local court house to do free legal research. When you start, TELL EVERYONE

### 7. r/LawFirm — 2025-04-23 | 3pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Solo lawyer suggests considering an answering service to present a bigger outward appearance, though he personally does not use one.
*User type: business_owner*

> Here are my suggestions with some reasons.

Use WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.

Get at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.

For bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.

Consider having an answering service to present a "bigger" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.

For hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:

Printer with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.

Sheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.

Get a flatbed scanner if you need it.

Get fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.

Get a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.

Get a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.

Software oriented tools:

Please read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)

Notice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the à la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.

Of course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.

You need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with

### 8. r/LawFirm — 2025-02-27 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Virtual receptionist vendor pitches services to a law firm: answering calls, setting appointments, routing calls, and handling after-hours coverage as advantages over hiring in-house.
*User type: vendor*

> You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. 

Since your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.

### 10. r/LawFirm — 2024-04-06 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Marketing consultant recommends Smith.ai or similar service for solo attorneys to ensure calls are answered and leads aren't lost.
*User type: consultant*

> I’m not a lawyer, I’m a growth strategist  and fractional CMO for lawyers/ firms and you’re getting amazing advice here. 

A few things I’d add: 

1. Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.
2. Make sure there’s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.
3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. 
4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.
5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc 
6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority 
7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it 

Once you’ve got some clients going and you want more or you’ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there’s advanced marketing strategies I’d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. 

I’m excited for you. I hope it goes well! 

If you’re got more questions feel free to ask.

### 11. r/VOIP — 2024-08-23 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5

**Pain point:** Cloud-based answering service or call center solutions are more cost-effective and flexible than on-premise PBX systems for handling business calls.
*User type: consultant*

> Either a cloud based phone system with a cloud based SIP phone service provider or a cloud based answering service or call center type solution would remove a lot of the limitations you currently have. It seems the rules of this sub say that I can’t recommend products or services so I guess that’s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There’s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!

### 12. r/LawFirm — 2025-07-07 | 2pts | Quality: 2/5 | Product: **Ruby Receptionist**

**Pain point:** Consultant advises new solo PI attorney to consider Ruby Receptionist or virtual assistant for initial intake to avoid missing time-sensitive leads while in court.
*User type: consultant*

> Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.

From what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.

A few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.

One thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.

Also, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.

The intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.

Good luck with the new practice!
