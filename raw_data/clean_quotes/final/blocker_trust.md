**Pain point:** AI tools are not ready for full PI intakes yet because clients aren't comfortable talking to them; a receptionist can take the first call but a human paralegal should qualify the lead
*User type: business_owner*

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

**Pain point:** Lawyer acknowledges AI could help with intake but says prospects don't want to communicate with AI -- they want to talk to a person.
*User type: business_owner*

> As others have said, we don’t let prospects book online because not everyone who thinks they are a prospect are suited to work with us.  They need to be vetted first.  
We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren’t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can’t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.  Now if the firm isn’t returning your call, that is on them.

### 3. r/agency — 2024-12-08 | 2pts | Quality: 3/5

**Pain point:** AI customer service creates frustration; prediction that having a real human answer phones will become a competitive differentiator in the next 15-20 years.
*User type: consultant*

> Very interesting insight. I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers. I honestly think in the next 15-20 years that having a real person answer the phone will make any company stand out.

### 4. r/LawFirm — 2024-12-10 | 2pts | Quality: 3/5 | Product: **Smith.ai**

**Pain point:** Smith.ai employee explains their human-first and AI-first products, emphasizing that call data is never used for third-party LLM training, addressing lawyer confidentiality concerns.
*User type: vendor*

> Absolutely, it's a huge risk people are taking with the new wave of gen AI products. [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) has two products -- human-first and ai-first. Human is backed up by AI guiding/informing call flow and AI-first is human-in-the-loop for escalation and verification. In neither case is call data used for training a 3rd party LLM or breaching any confidentiality. When we first launched in 2016, a thread blew up on Lawyerist about the risks of using Virtual Receptionists (even pre-AI) in breaching confidentiality and since then we've worked closely with our own customers & legal advisors to make sure we're doing things right.

**Pain point:** Solo attorney rejected an answering service that used high-pressure limited-time pricing tactics when he asked for a couple extra days to decide.
*User type: business_owner*

> The quickest way to lose a sale with me is to try to use time as a pressure point.  Rarely will a couple days be enough time for me to realistically evaluate what you're selling, so be prepared to adjust the trial period. Likewise, don't tell me that the price is only available if I commit right away -- if you're selling me something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars over a lifetime, I need to take my time, and as a solo, I don't have time to spend hours at a time making a decision right away.  A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.  Needless to say, I declined to consider them after that.
