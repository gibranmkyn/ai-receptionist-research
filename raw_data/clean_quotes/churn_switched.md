### 1. r/LawFirm — 2024-03-22 | Quality: ?/5 | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> We dropped Smith.ai for the same reason. The first few client complaints I ignored because I thought “clients can be tough” but after the 4th complaint I realized it was not the clients but actually Smith.ai. We moved to Ruby with no complaints so far.

> I tried out Call Ruby (a US-based virtual receptionist service).  They were really good, but I cancelled -- let's be real, no one was calling me at the outset.  lol

### 3. r/agency — 2026-01-27 | Quality: ?/5

> Hello!   
  
What would your advice be for a 19 year old joining the agency space. I started 6 months ago an agency or ai agency, in uni first year in a foreign country (Netherlands), started selling AI Chatbots and Receptionists and came quickly to the conclusion that I dont need to sell AI, but the outcome.   
  
I’ve tried cold calling, cold DMs, cold email, door 2 door, and my personal network, but haven’t landed a client yet. I don’t speak Dutch, only English and my home language, which made things harder locally. I spent the first 4–5 months focusing on real estate in the Netherlands and had conversations, but repeatedly got ditched.   
  
After that, I switched my offer to lead generation (ads + lead qualification and booking systems) for roofers in the US. At times, I’ve felt unsure whether I’m focusing on the right things or just creating activity without progress.  
  
If you were starting today with zero clients, what would you focus on first, and what would you stop doing immediately?

I should also mention that I have some small social proof: I built two websites from scratch for a small coffee shop and ran ads for it.

I’m not afraid of critique and would genuinely value a raw answer.

Appreciate your time either way.
