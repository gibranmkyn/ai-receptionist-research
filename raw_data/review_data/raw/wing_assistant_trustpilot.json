Last time we had to hire we went through 3 hires who didn't work out before we found a good fit. We didn't have time to go through months of false starts again for this position... then we learned about Wing Assistant. Wing made the process so easy - they had an administrative assistant on within a few days and she has been terrific. She's very skilled in administrative functions, software and support best practices. Working with Wing gave us peace of mind because they did the recruiting, hiring and should we ever need a replacement, they would take care of that within days as well. We will definitely use Wing again when we need help. They can provide any level or skillset needed, plus they take care of the employee benefits, payroll, etc. I highly recommend their services.",

    "text": "DO NOT HIRE A WING ASSISTANT - they fake their timesheets and lie about doing work.\nI used a Wing Assistant for a year, being billed for 4 hours a day for their time.  I assigned approx 1-2 hrs per day of tasks, so I did expect that EVERYTHING would get completed daily within the 4 hours.\n\nMy assistant was pretty good for awhile, then after several months I noticed that she was just copy-pasting her daily notes, and daily explanations of what was being completed.  I brought this to the attention of her supervisor, V****, who said he would look into it.  Nothing was resolved.\n\nSeveral months later, I not only noticed she was still just copy-pasting her daily note, but she had not done one of her REQUIRED DAILY tasks for over a month.  I brought this to her attention as well as to the supervisor's, and then she started calling in sick.  After a few weeks of promises of making up the sick time, promising to fully complete a daily timesheet, I finally asked for a new assistant.\n\nI asked for a refund for the prior 2 months that my assistant had done only 2 hrs of tasks, yet I'd been billed for 80 hours of work.  V***** said that he would not give a refund but he would offer the first 2 months of a new assistant to be free.\n\nWhen I finally got a replacement assistant, I started off things on the right foot by asking her to give me a full timesheet EVERY SINGLE DAY.  That was my main requirement - just send me one email at the end of each day saying what you accomplished.  She did it a couple times, that's it. She called in sick one day, and said that the power was out several days so that she couldn't work.  After 2 weeks I contacted V**** again and said that this assistant also could not follow directions, was taking time off and then not making up for it, and I wanted the 2 months refunded.\n\nV**** has written me back once, saying no refunds.  I have followed up multiple times complaining that they billed me for 2 months where my assistant was not doing anything - they did not care.  They did nothing to remedy it.  I have not heard back from anyone else, so I'm now resorting to telling everyone that I can -\n\nDO NOT HIRE AN ASSISTANT FROM WING.\n\n(This was originally posted on May 9, 2024, then Wing got my review removed by stating that I'm not allowed to name a person's name.  So now I've edited my original complaint, only removing the manager's name, and reposted on Dec 5, 2025)",

    "text": "I run three companies and signed up for Wing because I needed a highly capable virtual assistant to manage day-to-day client and staff communications in Washington and take admin work off my plate. Wing upsold me to their $1,500/month \u201cpremium\u201d VA plan and promised not only a qualified assistant but also a \u201ccustomer success manager\u201d supervising them.\n\nThe reality: I spent three weeks rewriting almost every email and text my Wing VA sent. I even had to step in personally to phone contractors and customers because the VA could not handle basic customer service or staff management. The VA was clearly underqualified and unskilled\u2014nothing like what Wing advertised. Their so-called \u201ccustomer success manager\u201d was non-existent in practice; no proactive support, no supervision, and certainly no accountability.\n\nWhen I finally cancelled and asked for my money back, I learned Wing offers no guarantee. You\u2019re simply out the money, no matter how bad the service.\n\nSince leaving Wing, I\u2019ve hired a new VA on my own. I gave her the exact same SOPs I\u2019d given Wing\u2014and within days she was flawlessly running my company with hardly any input from me. That is what I thought Wing would deliver.\n\nIf you\u2019re a busy business owner looking for a vetted, high-level assistant and hands-on support, my experience shows Wing does not stand behind its promises.",

When I finally got a response, they admitted to \u201can unexpected setback that affected [their] ability to meet the initial SLA timeline.\u201d\n\nDespite that, they refused to refund the deposit, claiming that \u201cas outlined in the contract you signed, the deposit is non-refundable, particularly in cases where we\u2019ve already provided candidates for your role.\u201d However, no qualified candidate was actually provided, and communication was virtually nonexistent during that time.\n\nThey did offer to apply the deposit \u201cas a credit toward your next hire,\u201d but after this experience, I have no interest in working with them again. The lack of accountability, poor communication, and refusal to make things right makes this a service I cannot recommend.",

I gave them some time to improve and started to feedback to the customer success manager, they promised more trainings, after waiting I realised no more trainings were coming and eventually the customer success manager started pitching me another company they knew and worked for on the side. I cancelled the contract. When I contacted the leadership on Linkedin and email to share my feedback, they were unresponsive, try to spin it my patience against me and finally hide behind their T&Cs. All while sending automated emails about how they have made changes and are better now. I wish I had had a better experience as the begining was great but it ended up terribly. Unfortunately it seems to be the experience of a lot of recent reviews.",
