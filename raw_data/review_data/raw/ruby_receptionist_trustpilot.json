    "title": "Terrible and Costly Billing Practices",
    "text": "I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.\n\nUPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., \"We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money\").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.",

Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled.

But if your callers ask even simple questions\u2014like \u201cDo you have a website?\u201d\u2014it\u2019s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn\u2019t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.\n\nTheir sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn\u2019t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can\u2019t say your name right, what does that say about your business?",

Not only was that great, she said she\u2019d follow up with me in a week\u2026and she did! It\u2019s hard sometimes to get people to actually follow up, so excellent work Bri!",

Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn\u2019t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors. Thank you again Ruby for the winner mentality, look forward to taking your good service to great and even better!",

This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.\n\nThe agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs? Given the high price they charge, I expected much better. Sadly, their service falls far below even the most basic standards.

    "text": "For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.\n\nRuby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.\n\nFirst, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  \n\nI would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It\u2019s horrific. You can't get anyone from their \u201chappiness team\u201d on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on.

Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal!

    "text": "I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.\n\nRuby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.\n\nEven then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. \n\nThe very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.\n\nFrustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another \"Urgent\" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.\n\nTo add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.\n\nI tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.\n\nIf you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save yourself the trouble and explore other options that prioritize professionalism and accuracy in call handling.",

    "text": "Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.",

    "text": "My recent engagements with Ruby Customer Service weren't what I expected. I was pretty much challenged by the representative regarding instructions I gave to the receptionist regarding someone calling inbound for the 'wrong company.' The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them. So sad that this situation could have ended differently if only the receptionist valued my words more than the callers.",

    "text": "It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  \n\nI have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  \n\nYesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying \"put them into voicemail\".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.\n\nThe app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  \n\nRuby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.",
