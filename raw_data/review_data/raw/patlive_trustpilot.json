    "text": "I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she\u2019d be there until everything was running smoothly.\n\nI had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, \"We can't do that for your company.\" I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.\n\nNow, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they\u2019ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me\u2014PATLive won me over from Day One!",

When we realized that they could also help during holidays and times when we have offsite office training it felt like a no-brainer to enroll in the free trial period. Amy Hearn was our on-boarding specialist and was wonderful through the whole set-up process & trial period. She explained everything we needed to know and was quick to answer any questions we had. When testing the call service operators each experience was positive and professional. Now we are past the on-boarding period and rely on daily message logs and their normal Customer Service Team which have also proven to be just as responsive. If you are on the fence about trying a call service, go to their website and read about all the services they offer, then just do it and give PATLive a try!",

There appears to be limited live face training on each client, so your script needs to be so easy a caveman could execute on it.

Only the top reps can pick up on this and execite via the offline training, and the newest reps stumble and execute poorly.  Escalating for help is tough because ecveryne is \"pat\" and everyone is at supervisor level, who can help and change your script.",
