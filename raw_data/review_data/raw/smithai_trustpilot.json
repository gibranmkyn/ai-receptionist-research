    "text": "We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!\n\nJust read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.",

I was incredibly fearful about what my experience would be working with an AI company that had not been around for very long, but my biggest concerns were how it was going to have an impact on my customers. I just bought out my business partner in June and was essentially relaunching my business without having the sales staff that I previously had. I knew I needed help on a lot of it, I just wasn\u2019t able to afford hiring a sales team to sit in the office and work alongside me. The system is very user-friendly in terms of setting up your AI assistant and my AI assistant answers and handles calls accordingly to how I set it up and based on customer interactions. It truly is remarkable! What I love the most is that if the caller wants to speak to a live person, my AI assistant will transfer the call over to a live person who then intern handles the call so professionally, and according to my preferences and preset standards I set for calls to be answered by live agents. I immediately get an email transcription for my AI assistant and or the live agent to myself, and my colleagues letting me know that a call came in and with every little detail about the call I absolutely love using Smith AI and don\u2019t think I will change. I more believe I will grow my business with them as they grow by adding new call center services.",

After we switched to a different U.S. based answering service with a U.S based representatives we have not had any issues. All calls are now handled perfectly. Wished left smith sooner than we did.",

    "text": "Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn\u2019t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.\n\nThe dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.\n\nThe HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.\n\nThe RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.\n\nUltimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, unaddressed concerns, and misleading information about their integrations. We would have had to make too many concessions to continue with their service, and their lack of reimbursement for our poor experience only further exacerbated our disappointment. \n\nIt is shocking when their Head of Client Operations says \u201cthe service you have received is far below what we strive to provide, and that is unacceptable\u201d and \u201cnever should a client experience what you have\u201d yet they still felt they had delivered what was paid for and did not refund a dime beyond the mistaken second charge. They only offered a credit for the future, which after this experience, we obviously would not use since I cannot recommend them at all.",

I've worked with them for over a year and it's been a parade of incompetence the entire time. They have wasted our ad budget, lost customers for us, and wasted hours of our time. Please do not make the mistake of selecting them, as once you do there are real switching costs. We've been so busy with our business we haven't had time to switch, but I promise you we will.

    "title": "Continuous Billing After Cancellation",
    "text": "(SEE EDIT BELOW) Generally an okay company, but one star for questionable billing practices.  Company continues to bill us even though our service was canceled.  We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.   He apologized, which is appreciated.  But offered no explanation or assurance about what happened.  ***** He asked us to remove our Trustpilot review as it was hurting the business.  I advised him that I WOULD *update* the review to show that he responded, but that I would tell the truth.  He offered to compensate us for the removal with free services, but we declined as we don't need them.  We're glad he responded to the review, but we wish he would have responded to our request for a refund after we were incorrectly billed after cancellation instead of doing nothing.",

    "title": "Receptionists do not read instructions",
    "text": "UPDATE to 1 Start: Smith.si response's is a material misrepresentation of what transpired. My experience was after they answered calls for just 4 days. No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you. \n\nTo be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation. \n\nAt no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when \"copying and pasting\" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]\n\nThis whole \u201cHelp us help you\u201d is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no \"confirmation\" that I was referred to as an \"attorney\" is just shameful.  \n\nIgnoring your guidance? Guidance for what exactly? To change my business operation to fit your model? No, thank you. Just be honest and say your system is inflexible and has limitations. Your team is not trained to ask follow-up questions in order to obtain the information needed to qualify the lead. My automated service can do that. You do not truly have bilingual services. I had to pay for a separate dedicated Spanish line. I have moved on to a service where all reps are actually bilingual and I get to try their service FREE! \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nReceptionists do not read instructions. There were multiple issues, such as scheduling telephone consults without offering in-person or virtual options; not accurately screening callers; Referring to me as an attorney (I am a Legal Document Assistant) which opens up my business for considerable liability.  \n\nFollow-up emails sent to customers did not have a salutation or signature line. To some extent, this can be viewed it's a simple oversight, but there is an expectation of reasonableness. Is it unreasonable to expect a greeting or with requesting that a signature line be included in emails? I don't think so. My Onboard Specialist just went over this morning. And, it still appears that the email signature line did not make it into the revisions. What is unreasonable is the amount of time I'm spending on such a simple request. The fact that emails went out without a greeting or signature line is not how I wish to be presented to the public. It also explains why my client conversion rate dropped immediately after implementing Smith.ai.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Smith.ai. On one hand, the agents do a relatively good job - better than another leading law firm answering service in my opinion. On the other hand, billing and support is terrible. I lost at least  2 days of calls because of a snafu on their end when the account was set up. I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.) Their billing practices are also a little absurd - at least when you have more than one account with them. It's a constant mess. Your needs may be simpler, so YMMV.",
