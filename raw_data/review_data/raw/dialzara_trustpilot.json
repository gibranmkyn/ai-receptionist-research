    "title": "Kudos to Dialzara",
    "text": "We have met with several AI receptionist providers and even entered into a couple of contracts, but ultimately found that their products just couldn\u2019t quite adapt to what we needed and were much more expensive on top of it. Dialzara is by far the best and most user-friendly option we\u2019ve come across. The owner of the company did a zoom call with me and took the time to send a 20-minute follow up video specific to our account to make sure we were comfortable with making our own changes in the future.",

    "text": "We started using Dialzara to help manage incoming calls, and it\u2019s been surprisingly easy to set up and adjust. Teaching it, correcting it, and refining how it responds didn\u2019t take much time at all.\n\nWhat really stood out to me is how realistic it sounds compared to other AI call systems I\u2019ve tested \u2014 including some that cost significantly more. It handles real client conversations well, filters out marketing and solicitation calls, and helps keep my day organized instead of constantly interrupting it.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s been a solid tool for managing calls and improving how we handle client communication.",
