**"Great Costumer Service"**

> From the very beginning, I felt the support, empathy, and kindness of the team. This was my first time using this type of service, and I was completely lost about how the process worked. However, they truly made me feel guided every step of the way. It felt as if they held my hand and patiently walked me through the entire process with professionalism, care, and genuine dedication.

I am extremely happy that I chose this company. They made me feel valued and truly special. Thank you!

**"I just wanted to share my experiencePATLive won me over from Day One!"**

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.

I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.

Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me—PATLive won me over from Day One!

**"answering service "**

> I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional work of the ladies who handle incoming calls. My review of calls for my business revealed consistent professionalism, even when faced with rude and disrespectful callers. Their handling was commendable, far exceeding how I would have responded.

Additionally, my onboarding specialist, Amy Hearn, provided the perfect balance of compassion and professionalism, making me feel welcomed and supported. She was always available to answer questions and guide me through the onboarding process.

Thank you for providing such outstanding service.

Sincerely,
Darrel Bish

**"Great customer service"**

> This morning, I had the pleasure of speaking with Jessica P., a representative from PATLive, about the onboarding process. It was, without a doubt, one of the best customer service experiences I’ve had in a long time. Jessica was incredibly informative, highly professional, and guided me seamlessly through the process. She also shared additional insights that made signing up with PATLive an easy and obvious decision. I truly wish every company had dedicated professionals like Jessica on their team.

**"Excellent Customer Service Thus Far"**

> Just signed up today so I don't have any input on how the service will be going forward. However so far so good! Jess was my initial contact and I was super happy with the level of service she provided. She was very informative and knowledgable regarding the platform. Jess took the time to answer all my questions and I never felt rushed which is important to me. I actually had two other calls scheduled today with competitors but decided to sign up with Pat Live because of the way I was treated by Jess. She is definitely an asset to Pat Live's team

**"Wonderful & Professional"**

> We were referred to PATLive by our digital marketing agency as a suggestion to make our firm available to potential clients any time of day. When we realized that they could also help during holidays and times when we have offsite office training it felt like a no-brainer to enroll in the free trial period. Amy Hearn was our on-boarding specialist and was wonderful through the whole set-up process & trial period. She explained everything we needed to know and was quick to answer any questions we had. When testing the call service operators each experience was positive and professional. Now we are past the on-boarding period and rely on daily message logs and their normal Customer Service Team which have also proven to be just as responsive. If you are on the fence about trying a call service, go to their website and read about all the services they offer, then just do it and give PATLive a try!

**"I had a different answering service for…"**

> I had a different answering service for our business before coming to PATLive and was completely unsatisfied with them. PATLive has been so easy to work with. Our Onboarding Specialist, Matthew, has been great in getting all the information needed for our company. I love the way that PATLive operates and has been able to integrate into our Jobber software. It really gives me the downtime needed but also pease of knowing all of our customers are still being taken care of!

**"PATLive is the BEST"**

> PATLive is a Great Call Center/Receptionist company. They take all kinds of calls and allow me to be able to run my business without having to worry about the phone. 

They are able to integrate with my CRM to be able to track the calls easily and have all the data that i need readily available to return the calls with all the info that I need to have a good conversation. 

If you company get spam calls or hate calls, this is a great service to be able to weed out these calls and only talk to the people who are actually interested in working with you.

**"PatLive Valued and Trusted Partner"**

> PatLive has been our partner for over 3 years now.  They handle all Work Order calls 24/7 for our 40+ properties.
PatLive has averaged over 25,000 work orders entered into our system in real time per year, and handled thousand of additional calls for follow up.   PatLives's  responsiveness and customer service has been excellent.
During the Pandemic they have not missed a beat and continued to service our customers/residents well.  Their adoption in using our work order system and using our on-call system for emergencies has been excellent and reduced additional damages to units.

We did a lot of tests and reviewed our callers.
The main point of critique is that the ringtime is very long. We are risking to lose customers due to that.
I am positive that this issue can be solved.

> Accurate information is extremely important.  We continually receive misspelled names, emails, addresses from the agents.  I know not all callers are happy to share but we can’t be guessing either.  Also had a budget in mind for what I would pay for this service and the bill has remained 7-10 times over that price every month.  I have really low expectations, just trying to survive in a sea of complications so would like to eliminate all internal obstacles.  We are stubbornly hanging on hoping for better results out of this engagement.  I give it average but I have nothing to compare it too except our own or previous office staff.

**"Zero Stars:"**

> Zero Stars:
Worse Than Bad

I asked that service be started and billed after I received my first legitimate call from a customer.
This request was denied.

The only calls I received were prank calls on a daily basis and a test call from myself.

When the person answered, I couldn't understand what they said.

When I attempted to cancel the service, I waited 7 min. on hold for Customer Service before hanging up and trying again. 

I called again and waited 4 min. before hanging up and trying again.

When I did reach someone, it took over 10 min. to cancel the service, and, they wanted to charge me another 33$...on top of the set-up charge and monthly charges I had already paid.

Please make certain I am not charged 33$.

Thank You.

Respectfully- 

-Richard

**"Overall they will answer the phones and…"**

> Overall they will answer the phones and try to follow the script.  There appears to be limited live face training on each client, so your script needs to be so easy a caveman could execute on it.  In my case, I need a series of information gathering questions to be asked skillfully and in the right context in order to successfully execute and gather basic intel like name, email, and telephone.  Only the top reps can pick up on this and execite via the offline training, and the newest reps stumble and execute poorly.  Escalating for help is tough because ecveryne is "pat" and everyone is at supervisor level, who can help and change your script.

**"Be careful about them, scam and fraud possible."**

> Be careful about them, scam and fraud possible.

We registered for their free trial service, they wrote on their website you can try 14 days for free. After the setup, I can't find the things they promoted on the website about the features and capabilities. All things they promoted handled manually, they have not any web panel for managing your service.
Also, they charge you for any call they receive, it's mean they receive many calls not related to your business, they will charge you for nothing.

Finally after a few hours, decided to go for another service.
Their stupid email started from the next day, about setup the account, after some day, 
about some calls we received at the number, we didn't use at all (they have a robot or some fake caller) 
finally, after 2 weeks they sent the invoice and said you should pay for trial service you didn't use it at all.
They really changed the free trial service meaning on the internet.

After received many calls and email from them, I sent an email to them and asked, please stop sending and calling and terminate that stupid thing.
Someone from their company replied you should pay to cancel

Wish it was cheap like around $130 but they've been gradually raising their prices if you cancel and opt back in you get the higher prices.

Good experienced at taking calls. You have to test to make sure your scripts and flow are being used correctly. 

Also bots tend to call, so you got to have someone monitor it and tell them to block it...they need to have an automatic bot message blocking function for free. It's using our precious minutes
