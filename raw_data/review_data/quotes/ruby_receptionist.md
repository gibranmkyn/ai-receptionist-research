**"Extremely dodgy"**

> Extremely dodgy. Linked to multiple health/informative apps, including myiq.com.  I tood an IQ test for £1, and it subscribed me to a £29.99 subscription without my consent (and no this was not remotely made clear).  Luckily they provide a money back guarantee according to their T&C's.... The catch? It's a scam.  Their customer service is a bot that will eternally tell you that they can't find your details. I googled it and others had the same.  So he warned! Luckily my credit cart are stepping in.

**"very responsive, good communication"**

**"Exceptional Strategic Support – A Rare Find in 25 Years of IT/Marketing"**

> I’ve spent over two decades in IT and Marketing, and I rarely encounter customer success service as phenomenal as what Anase N'gadi provides at Ruby. Anase is more than just a support contact; he’s a true partner who took the time to understand our strategic goals and even the "workarounds" we’ve implemented to maximize efficiency. From helping us activate advanced AI features like Sentiment Analysis and Transcription to discussing complex future integrations for our billing processes, Anase’s expertise is evident. If you’re looking for a service that truly scales with your business, Ruby is the gold standard.

**"Ruby is a huge asset to our company"**

> Ruby is a huge asset to our company, especially during our busy months! Being able to talk to a real person after hours was a huge deal to our customers. The Ruby staff is professional, consistent, and polite. I would highly recommend their services if you are a small or large business.

**"Ruby Receptionist has been great!"**

> Ruby Receptionist has been great!
They have helped improve my workflow by mitigating calls on my behalf. We have also had a better rate of return on gaining more consultations and potential clients since hiring Ruby. Previously, many calls were missed or people would not leave voicemails, and we were missing out on a lot of potential leads. They also update your company's information quickly to be able to better assist clients and leads.

### 9. 2025-10-14 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Terrible and Costly Billing Practices"**

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.

UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").  Ruby -- If you really want to make things right, just apply a credit to my account for this billing period, and I'll update this review, so people will know it actually gets done.  Thanks.

**"We are using Ruby to handle after-hours…"**

> We are using Ruby to handle after-hours and weekend calls only. Prior to trying Ruby, we relied on the customer to leave a voicemail. These then went to a voice-to-text email. The system was less than impressive and customers hated using a menu-based system. Since switching to Ruby, our customers appreciate talking to a live person on the first ring. The operators know when to forward a priority call. We've already had to increase our minutes per month and we're maxing that out already. Our communication and outreach to the customer has been great. And the messages we receive are much more detailed than before. We're happy we made this switch.

**"I’ve had such a great experience…"**

> I’ve had such a great experience working with Christina at Ruby. From the start, she’s been incredibly helpful, responsive, and knowledgeable; making the entire process smooth and easy to navigate. She took the time to understand our needs and made sure we had all the tools and support needed to get started with Ruby and explore new features like live chat. Her professionalism, patience, and friendly approach truly stand out, and it’s been a pleasure working with her. Thanks again, Christina, for all your support

### 17. 2025-08-31 | ★★★☆☆

**"Sales team great, answering execution terrible"**

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.

If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.

Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

**"Ruby is literally the most fantastic…"**

> Ruby is literally the most fantastic answering service I have ever used, and I've been using answering services for over 30 years!
My clients think that they are talking to my office assistant, not a service.
Whenever I have a slight change to make in their script, it is handled effectively and immediately.
I wish all of my providers were as friendly, capable, and caring as Ruby is!

**"A Game-Changer for Solo Law Practice"**

> Ruby’s virtual receptionist service has been a game-changer for my solo law firm. Their friendly, professional receptionists ensure that every client call is answered promptly and warmly, no more missed opportunities or voicemails piling up. As a solo practitioner, having Ruby handle client intake, appointment scheduling, and basic FAQs has freed up valuable time for me to focus on casework. The service is reliable, easy to integrate with my practice management tools, and gives my firm the polished, responsive feel of a much larger operation. Highly recommended for solo attorneys looking to elevate client experience and streamline operations.

The team was responsive, understood our needs right away, and implemented the changes without any delays. I especially appreciated the clear communication and their willingness to go the extra mile—text alerts, backup call routing, and follow-up were all handled flawlessly. Their service has been reliable and supportive for our clinic operations, and I highly recommend them to any organization looking for dependable answering services.

All the people I have spoken to at Ruby are regular people with a sense of humor--not stuffed shirts. I have worked at law firms my whole life; I have enough stuffed shirts to last a lifetime.

Bri helped me out with going over our minutes being used and definitely help me understand what plan we should use. Not only was that great, she said she’d follow up with me in a week…and she did! It’s hard sometimes to get people to actually follow up, so excellent work Bri!

**"Dedication "**

> I was blown away by the lengthy, articulate and expansively descriptive email response Ruby sent me regarding assessment of the intake calls process.  Not only was it thoughtful and thorough, but they are more than willing to troubleshoot how to gauge certain types of service calls to be handled differently than other types. Mind you, their 3 months in review of service have already been absolutely AMAZING!  We work in a very unique industry and the refinement I am asking for is high maintenance to a degree.  Though it is necessary for resource optimization as well as prioritizing some clients ahead of others.  Notwithstanding, there is not an easy fix.  They couldn’t be more game for the brainstorming.  It is that type of high level customer service separating them from their competitors. Thank you again Ruby for the winner mentality, look forward to taking your good service to great and even better!

**"Best decision we have made this year!"**

> Ruby is the best vendor decision our law firm has made this year! 

When our previous call center was costing us valuable potential cases compared to the "value" pricing of their service, we took a leap of faith and signed on with Ruby. 

And Ruby has already proved the ol' adage "you get what you pay for!" Ruby agents handle calls with such professionalism and care that there are times their process even exceeds my expectations! I am beyond grateful that we made the switch! 

They are easy to work with, quick to respond, and great with communication and data gathering. They match our values of treating every call with kindness and patience. 

We are so happy to have found Ruby!

### 51. 2024-11-23 | ★★☆☆☆

**"Constant Mistakes and Extremely Poor Support"**

> This is one of the worst services I've used as a business owner.

There are CONSTANT mistakes including:

- Collecting and submitting emails incorrectly
- Submitting names incorrectly
- Not collecting required details
- Not submitting forms

In addition to the mistakes, the customer's service is extremely poor. The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.

When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service. When I tried to reach out to her to air my grievances, she basically told me it's not her problem and to deal with support.

I believe that it's a management/operations issue rather than a specific receptionist issue, which is why I've given an extra star.

I am looking for a replacement and canceling the service.

### 52. 2024-11-12 | ★★★☆☆

**"Good for Forwarding ALL Calls or Taking a Msg for ALL Calls, Not Good for Detailed Instructions Regarding Call Handling"**

> They have a couple of really good receptionists. They can be great if you work with one or two consistently regarding your account. But having so many receptionists, with our firm having a list of specific call handling instructions, we get a lot of errors. We gets calls forwarded to the office when a message should have been taken, and we receive messages when the call should have been forwarded. The business is a great concept, but I don't recommend it unless you just need a receptionist to answer your calls and either forward ALL of them or take a message for ALL of them. They should assign a specific number of receptionists per client or have fewer employees.

> We have been using Ruby Receptionist for a few months and we are happy with the service so far! We appreciate the peace of mind we get with Ruby Receptionists answering our calls, getting them to the right person, taking informative messages for us, and filtering out robo calls too! There is a learning curve in the beginning but well worth it!

**"Stop-gap between admin employees"**

> Our small law firm is currently looking for a new admin employee/ receptionist, and in the meantime, our attorneys were taking all of the cold calls on our main line.  Signing up for Ruby allowed us to weed out spam, marketing, and robo calls without taking up any of our professional's time, and helped us to narrow down good potential leads from those that weren't right for our firm.  This has freed up more valuable time than we could have expected. We are thrilled with Ruby's results.

Absolutely deceptive billing practices - do NOT use this company.

**"SO DISAPPOINTED"**

> I am extremely disappointed with Ruby Live Receptionist's service. I recently had a live chat experience with their unqualified representative, and it was a complete disaster. Despite asking a very simple question, I received no helpful answers. Instead, the ruby's live chat agent repeatedly asked the same questions, clearly not paying attention to my responses. This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.

The agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs? Given the high price they charge, I expected much better. Sadly, their service falls far below even the most basic standards. I would not recommend Ruby Live Receptionist to anyone looking for reliable and respectful service.

**"Run, don't walk, far from this company"**

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.

Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.

First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.  

I would also like to note that Ruby is the absolute most expensive option. I originally chose them since I am willing to pay for top service. For the first few years, this was the case. Now I feel like I am paying for the Ritz Carlton and getting Motel 8. The customer service is a 1 out of 5 stars. It’s horrific. You can't get anyone from their “happiness team” on the line - EVER. You wait on hold for 30+ minutes, calls are not returned in a timely manner, and you can never speak to the same person twice. The list goes on and on. Don't be fooled, when they mishandled my calls there was absolutely zero urgency to call me back or try to correct their errors. Zero urgency and zero customer respect.  

Their reply says it all. It shows their aggression and their "blame the customer" mentality that comes from the top down. Like I said, run don't walk, far from this company.

**"Ruby is terrible!!"**

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month.
2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days.
3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back!
4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

Unfortunately in the past few months there have been some changes to the company and staffing and there customer service has become horrible. I have sent several request over the past 30 days to get an item resolved which they used to handle in minutes, now you get passed around and once they are frustrated and can't get an answer for you, they just hang up on you. I spent 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get resolved and still nothing. Its very sad to watch such a great company take a nose dive, but I will no longer be using Ruby.com

**"I must say that my experience with Ruby is terrible."**

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.

Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.

Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen. 

The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's needs were within our expertise. Subsequent calls were also mishandled, and vital information such as phone numbers and email addresses was not taken down, making follow-ups impossible. To make matters worse, calls were not even transferred to our Intake Specialist, resulting in lost opportunities.

Frustrated with the recurring issues, I sent another "Urgent" email on July 17, requesting a prompt resolution. While I received an automated acknowledgement of my email, no one bothered to respond or reach out to discuss the problems. This level of neglect and disregard for customer concerns is unacceptable.

To add insult to injury, today, July 21, another lead was misguided by the receptionist, falsely stating that we do not handle SBA loan fraud defense cases when, in fact, it is our primary focus. This blunder was particularly damaging, as it was a lead generated through our paid advertising efforts on Google.

I tried to contact Ruby's team again, only to encounter the same lack of availability and unresponsiveness. At this point, I have no choice but to terminate  Ruby.com and warn others in the professional service industry to avoid their services at all costs.

If you value your clients and want to provide exceptional customer service that contributes to increased revenue, Ruby.com is not the solution. Their inability to follow instructions, mishandling of calls, and neglect of customer concerns make them an unreliable partner for any professional service provider. Save yourself the trouble and explore other options that prioritize professionalism and accuracy in call handling.

Despite flagging our support request as extremely urgent, we have had zero contact. This is extremely poor - I would give them zero stars if I could. We have started the process of looking for a new solution. I recommend that you do not engage with either PureChat or Ruby - look elsewhere.

**"Screening my calls EPIC FAILURE"**

> My recent engagements with Ruby Customer Service weren't what I expected. I was pretty much challenged by the representative regarding instructions I gave to the receptionist regarding someone calling inbound for the 'wrong company.' The Customer Service rep tried to be an advocate for the receptionist because 'she too used to be one' My point that I shared with the CS agent - is when I told the receptionist that the caller had the wrong number - that should have been the end of it. Just because the caller insisted to speak with someone (and we were very busy setting up a large event for 1000 people) the receptionist should have unequivocally taken my word at face value, after all, I am the President of the company. If I said 'they have the wrong number/wrong company' then that should have been the end of it. I hired Ruby to save me time and energy, and SCREEN calls for me. In this case not only did the receptionist basically ignore my instructions and insist on forwarding the call to me (who was EXTREMELY BUSY) but the Customer Service rep who I followed up with basically told me she AGREED with the receptionist's response. Totally unacceptable. My word should be all the validation anyone needs that the caller has the wrong number, and wrong business  - after all, I am the owner. As I told the receptionist - HE HAS THE WRONG NUMBER. No one listened, and they made their own assumptions on my dime and TIME. I was very happy with Ruby up until this call. Rule number #1 the customer is always right...especially when they tell you that they do not have any such person (the caller) on staff and they have the wrong number. Learn to listen to them. So sad that this situation could have ended differently if only the receptionist valued my words more than the callers.

**"Don't port your GV number!!"**

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about. I found myself going through logs and seeing 3 minutes and up to 5 minutes charges where the only information provided was name, phone, email and one line explanation of what the call was about. I don't need to supervise the reps. It's a compete waste of my time. I'm going with Smith.AI as they only charge per call not by minute. And certainly not for any spam, solicitation or dropped calls that they can't determine its due to spam or solicitation. Don't waste your time, go with another company.

Other times, they don't set an appointment for a new client, don't take detailed enough messages, get names or e-mail addresses for clients wrong, etc. If they could be more consistent I think they could do a much better job, because the employees who do good work do really good work.

It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.

I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.

I went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.

**"It's only been one week"**

> It's only been one week, but the receptionist does not seem to be able to differentiate between a sales call and a vendor that I'm doing business with. I guess maybe there's a portal that I should enter the names of my vendors etc and I'm not that far along yet in the onboarding.

**"No answer when customers call?"**

> A lot of time my customers are indicating that when they call no one answers and it goes to the answering robot through our service provider ring central. This is a big problem.
 However when they do answer they are very professional and polite.

**"It is a great service with numerous…"**

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.  

I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.  

Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.

The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.  

Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

**"Meh..."**

> I find that the receptionists are having a difficult time following my instructions about calls to put through.  I have also had occasions where I have called the happiness dept to confirm the instructions and the settings on the app (because they didnt seem aligned) and I was told twice that it was all correct, yet the receptionists were not doing things right.  I also called the happiness dept with instructions on how to handle calls while I was on vacation, and that got messed up too, and I had to call Ruby to talk about it from my vacation in St. Thomas.  Overall I am not very impressed and for the price I pay I am going to look into other options.

**"We are a small law firm with only five…"**

> We are a small law firm with only five employees and have been using Ruby for about six months.  Our call instructions are not always followed correctly, and the mix-up of two people who have the same first name continues.  It's kind of frustrating to have to keep emailing reminders to the staff about these two issues.

**"While the service is good, the price is not."**

> While the service is good, the price is not. Every year you can count on another big increase. If you are considering a US-based receptionist service, look around because there are better alternatives. 

(2018) My price went all the way up to $1279 which is a 42% increase in just a couple of years.

(2017) Prices range from $259-$989/month

(2016) Prices ranged from $259-$899/month

(2015) Prices ranged from $249-$819/month

(2014) Prices ranged from $239-$799 month

(2013) Prices ranged from $229-$769/month

(2012) Prices ranged from $219-$739/month

(2011) Prices ranged from $209-$699/month
