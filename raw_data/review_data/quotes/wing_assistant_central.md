**"Partnering with Wing Assistant "**

> We partnered with Wing Assistant to provide customer service coverage for our non-business hours.  We needed coverage from 4:30 pm to 8:00 am M-F and 24-hour coverage on the weekends.  Our Wing teammates provided this coverage without any interruption to support our basic business functions.  They easily integrated into our tech stack making communication with our Wing teammates seamless.  They did a tremendous job of supporting our customers and prospects throughout the entire partnership.

**"Wing Assistant has been an absolute lifesaver."**

> Wing Assistant has been an absolute lifesaver. They matched me with a virtual assistant who is professional, reliable, incredibly dedicated, and genuinely competent. She doesn’t just complete tasks—she owns them. My workweek is smoother, more focused, and far more productive because of her. I honestly can’t imagine operating without her at this point. If you’re on the fence about a VA, Wing makes the decision easy.

**"A great overall experience"**

> Working with Wing Assistant has been an amazing experience.  I use them for VAs for our Real Estate companies and they have become valued parts of our team.  They do a great job matching you with the right team members and I was surprised how quickly they learned our systems.  I will be using them more and more as our company grows!

**"Have recommended to multiple people"**

> Overall, my experience with Wing has been wonderful.  I have recommended Wing to multiple contacts of mine looking for virtual assistant services, and my company has since onboarded additional Virtual Assistants since we initially began working with Wing.  The assistant that I specifically work with, Anne, is absolutely incredible.  She is a joy to work with, communicates effectively and proactively, and has helped make our tasks more efficient and productive.

**"Quality, Passion, and Execution—All in One"**

> I've been impressed with quality of work we've received from Clyde.  His attention to detail, passion, and continued learning is refreshing to see with a new hire and we're seeing the return on our investment already. Clyde is balancing research, data collection, and outbound lead gen for me in a new geographic territory, and delivering results.  He's a much needed resource whom we highly value.

**"After 2 weeks, have an awesome experience!"**

> I would say that the only reason I only put 4 out of 5 stars it that up front, the turnover is a little high, meaning we have to interview several candidates before someone takes the job, and stays for more than a few days.  However, once they are here for over a week or so, the turnover is extremely low or zero.

**"We needed part-time help ... Wing made it happen"**

> We needed part-time help but as a 2.5 person remote team, we simply didn't have time to interview and go through the frustrating process of hiring, especially for remote support. Last time we had to hire we went through 3 hires who didn't work out before we found a good fit. We didn't have time to go through months of false starts again for this position... then we learned about Wing Assistant. Wing made the process so easy - they had an administrative assistant on within a few days and she has been terrific. She's very skilled in administrative functions, software and support best practices. Working with Wing gave us peace of mind because they did the recruiting, hiring and should we ever need a replacement, they would take care of that within days as well. We will definitely use Wing again when we need help. They can provide any level or skillset needed, plus they take care of the employee benefits, payroll, etc. I highly recommend their services.

> I have had a great experience with Wing Assistant.  The VAs I work with are consistent, reliable, and trustworthy.  They deliver great work every single day, they communicate with me regularly, and they are always willing adjust to changing needs or step up to help with special projects.  

Their support has made my workload much more manageable, and I genuinely appreciate everything they do.  I would definitely recommend Wing Assistant to anybody looking for dependable, high-quality virtual support.

**"DO NOT HIRE A WING ASSISTANT"**

> DO NOT HIRE A WING ASSISTANT - they fake their timesheets and lie about doing work.
I used a Wing Assistant for a year, being billed for 4 hours a day for their time.  I assigned approx 1-2 hrs per day of tasks, so I did expect that EVERYTHING would get completed daily within the 4 hours.

My assistant was pretty good for awhile, then after several months I noticed that she was just copy-pasting her daily notes, and daily explanations of what was being completed.  I brought this to the attention of her supervisor, V****, who said he would look into it.  Nothing was resolved.

Several months later, I not only noticed she was still just copy-pasting her daily note, but she had not done one of her REQUIRED DAILY tasks for over a month.  I brought this to her attention as well as to the supervisor's, and then she started calling in sick.  After a few weeks of promises of making up the sick time, promising to fully complete a daily timesheet, I finally asked for a new assistant.

I asked for a refund for the prior 2 months that my assistant had done only 2 hrs of tasks, yet I'd been billed for 80 hours of work.  V***** said that he would not give a refund but he would offer the first 2 months of a new assistant to be free.

When I finally got a replacement assistant, I started off things on the right foot by asking her to give me a full timesheet EVERY SINGLE DAY.  That was my main requirement - just send me one email at the end of each day saying what you accomplished.  She did it a couple times, that's it. She called in sick one day, and said that the power was out several days so that she couldn't work.  After 2 weeks I contacted V**** again and said that this assistant also could not follow directions, was taking time off and then not making up for it, and I wanted the 2 months refunded.

V**** has written me back once, saying no refunds.  I have followed up multiple times complaining that they billed me for 2 months where my assistant was not doing anything - they did not care.  They did nothing to remedy it.  I have not heard back from anyone else, so I'm now resorting to telling everyone that I can -

DO NOT HIRE AN ASSISTANT FROM WING.

(This was originally posted on May 9, 2024, then Wing got my review removed by stating that I'm not allowed to name a person's name.  So now I've edited my original complaint, only removing the manager's name, and reposted on Dec 5, 2025)

**"Wing has given me my life back!"**

> Wing has given me my life back! As a small business owner, I was working 16+ hours a day, at the risk of my well being and social life. Over the years, I have worked with Wing to find assistants to cover me 24/7. Not only do I get to work LESS, but my services are available MORE. They are communicative, fast learning and I’ve had no worry about turnover rate. If I need a replacement, they find them. But no one’s ever just quit on me, which speaks volumes about their management capabilities. Thanks, Wing!

**"Used them twice, will always recommend"**

> I've used them twice. What they do great is listen to your needs and requirements and then find the right person to match you with. They also make sure to have just enough oversight to not be overbearing and intrusive but also make sure the quality of work is great. Now, whether you will be compatible with the person they found is entirely out of their hands. However, they do offer replacements if it doesnt work out.

Her ability to anticipate my needs and support me before I even ask keeps me focused on what truly deserves my attention. I’m genuinely impressed and couldn’t be more satisfied with the caliber of service.

**"Adding Wing has been a great cost effective solution"**

> Working with Wing has been an outstanding experience. Their communication is clear, proactive, and always professional, and they’ve truly become an extension of our team. Everyone is easy to work with, highly reliable, and consistently delivers quality work.

Although the team is based in the Philippines, we’ve had zero issues with time differences—scheduling calls has been seamless, and the overnight workflow has been a huge benefit. We can hand off tasks at the end of our U.S. workday and wake up to completed work the next morning.

If you’re looking for strong operational support with excellent communication, dependable turnaround, and a team that integrates smoothly into your workflow, I highly recommend Wing.

**"I wanted to take a moment to highlight…"**

> I wanted to take a moment to highlight the incredible work Marie has been doing as our VA. She has quickly become an essential part of our operations, and her impact is noticeable every single day.

Marie is consistent, reliable, and always ahead of schedule. She takes initiative without being asked, communicates clearly, and handles every task with professionalism and a great attitude. Whether it’s managing emails, organizing schedules, handling parent communication, or supporting our internal workflows, she does it all with accuracy and efficiency.

She has also shown excellent judgment and problem-solving skills, which has made our day-to-day operations smoother and more organized. I truly appreciate how quickly she learns new processes and how committed she is to helping our team succeed.

Simply put — Marie has been a huge asset to us, and I couldn’t be happier with her performance.

Just wanted to make sure her hard work is recognized!

**"Executive Admin experience for a CIO"**

> My executive admin is doing well overall in her work for me. I have had a positive experience, at a big-picture level, with Wing. I appreciate that they care for their employees and treat them with respect, as well as provide fair compensation, which in turn creates a better experience for the customer.

Some of the inherent challenges of this model—common in offshore working relationships—include establishing the right context for the work. Cultural differences and learning curves can make it harder at first to achieve full situational awareness of your needs. However, we have made good progress in this area and continue to build greater effectiveness together.

### 42. 2025-09-23 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Paid $1,500/month for an unqualified VA—zero support or accountability"**

> I run three companies and signed up for Wing because I needed a highly capable virtual assistant to manage day-to-day client and staff communications in Washington and take admin work off my plate. Wing upsold me to their $1,500/month “premium” VA plan and promised not only a qualified assistant but also a “customer success manager” supervising them.

The reality: I spent three weeks rewriting almost every email and text my Wing VA sent. I even had to step in personally to phone contractors and customers because the VA could not handle basic customer service or staff management. The VA was clearly underqualified and unskilled—nothing like what Wing advertised. Their so-called “customer success manager” was non-existent in practice; no proactive support, no supervision, and certainly no accountability.

When I finally cancelled and asked for my money back, I learned Wing offers no guarantee. You’re simply out the money, no matter how bad the service.

Since leaving Wing, I’ve hired a new VA on my own. I gave her the exact same SOPs I’d given Wing—and within days she was flawlessly running my company with hardly any input from me. That is what I thought Wing would deliver.

If you’re a busy business owner looking for a vetted, high-level assistant and hands-on support, my experience shows Wing does not stand behind its promises.

### 43. 2025-07-28 | ★☆☆☆☆

**"Terrible experience"**

> My experience with Wing Assistant was very frustrating. After paying a deposit, I was completely ghosted for over three weeks, even though they had promised a clear onboarding timeline. When I finally got a response, they admitted to “an unexpected setback that affected [their] ability to meet the initial SLA timeline.”

Despite that, they refused to refund the deposit, claiming that “as outlined in the contract you signed, the deposit is non-refundable, particularly in cases where we’ve already provided candidates for your role.” However, no qualified candidate was actually provided, and communication was virtually nonexistent during that time.

They did offer to apply the deposit “as a credit toward your next hire,” but after this experience, I have no interest in working with them again. The lack of accountability, poor communication, and refusal to make things right makes this a service I cannot recommend.

**"AVOID AT ALL COSTS"**

> AVOID AT ALL COSTS
First, they do not pay their assistants well, see testimony on reddit. 
I've just tried working with them for 5 months and I have mixed feedback: when I started they upsold me to a MID level VA, my digital VA was super nice and hard working but didn't have all the skills to deliver on their promises. I gave them some time to improve and started to feedback to the customer success manager, they promised more trainings, after waiting I realised no more trainings were coming and eventually the customer success manager started pitching me another company they knew and worked for on the side. I cancelled the contract. When I contacted the leadership on Linkedin and email to share my feedback, they were unresponsive, try to spin it my patience against me and finally hide behind their T&Cs. All while sending automated emails about how they have made changes and are better now. I wish I had had a better experience as the begining was great but it ended up terribly. Unfortunately it seems to be the experience of a lot of recent reviews.

**"Horrible service"**

> I had a terrible experience with their service. They take 24 to 48 hours to respond, which is absurd. I do not recommend Wing. I want to cancel the virtual assistant service, but instead, they want meeting to discuss my reasons for wanting to cancel. The virtual assistant is not suitable for my office, and I feel that the work is not getting done effectively.
