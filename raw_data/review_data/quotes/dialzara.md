**"Kudos to Dialzara"**

> We have met with several AI receptionist providers and even entered into a couple of contracts, but ultimately found that their products just couldn’t quite adapt to what we needed and were much more expensive on top of it. Dialzara is by far the best and most user-friendly option we’ve come across. The owner of the company did a zoom call with me and took the time to send a 20-minute follow up video specific to our account to make sure we were comfortable with making our own changes in the future.

**"We started using Dialzara to help…"**

> We started using Dialzara to help manage incoming calls, and it’s been surprisingly easy to set up and adjust. Teaching it, correcting it, and refining how it responds didn’t take much time at all.

What really stood out to me is how realistic it sounds compared to other AI call systems I’ve tested — including some that cost significantly more. It handles real client conversations well, filters out marketing and solicitation calls, and helps keep my day organized instead of constantly interrupting it.

Overall, it’s been a solid tool for managing calls and improving how we handle client communication.

**"Highly Recommend Dial Zara!"**

> Dial Zara was so easy to set up and it is amazing the interaction created between the attendant and the caller.  From a price point perspective, it has tremendous value and has taken on a very labor-intensive part of our businesses.  The call transcript via text and email insures we don't miss calls.

**"DialZara is the best A.I. receptionist I have found!"**

> I have been investing real estate over 35 years. I have bought around 1,000 properties in 12 different states. 
I have tried multiple A.I. agent receptionist for my real estate business and all have failed except Dialzara. Not only is the technology superior to anything else I have found but the support and CS is better than anything else I have experienced. I love it! Not to mention I am now saving over $1,000 a month by cancelling my answering service! Go ahead and sign up for Business Plus. It's the done for you white glove service that will get you up and running in no time. In fact I was live in about an hour.

**"Dialzara has been an FANTASTIC"**

> Dialzara has been an absolute game-changer for me! The platform is incredibly user-friendly, making it easy to navigate and get things done quickly without any hassle. But what really sets Dialzara apart is their exceptional customer service. I've had a few questions along the way, and the support team was always prompt and super helpful in addressing them.
