> I've hired and managed well over 100 folks out of the Philippines over the years, but mostly I.T.  I hired on JD as a contract reviewer, but I didn't directly manage them.  I know they did well, so far as I was involved in their oversight.  I have a lot of thoughts about how to make working with somebody in the Philippines work out, and a lot of stories about it.  I just can't go into them here, but I'm open to connect for a call to talk shop one day.  I'll give you notes on the holidays, 13th month pay, and employers of record, ect.

For VR and phones, I also have a lot of experience and I have a couple of tips.  Just about all of them will expect you to forward your phone to them for the first ring, but it is probably possible for you to configure your system to ring to them only if you don't answer.  I can help you if they won't and you have trouble.

I'll say this though, that does increase the chance that your callers will hang up before they answer and they probably won't hesitate to point that out.  There will be a delay as the call switches between your phone and their line, then their standard stuff between that first ring and their answer.  Personally, I think this is fine.  I suppose some practice areas it might be a big deal, but for most imho, if somebody wants to talk to an attorney, they aren't going to hang up 4 rings in.

A service is either going to bill you by the minute or by the call.  If that is important to you, then it will narrow which services you can use.  Both models have their advantage.

All of the services will ask you to pay for so much per month in advance, then bill you overages after.  If you just don't have the volume to meet their bottom teir at signup, just about every one of them are open to reducing your account to a pay as you go, but they won't sign up new accounts that way.  It is sort of a trick and no guarantees, but you can pay like as low as $10 a month for 0 calls a month, then $10 a call every call over 1, then they will deflect sales calls for free.  It is a solid deal, so long as the quality or config isn't chasing away clients.

For some folks, though, that also doesn't matter too much.  Deflecting sales and inquires outside of the practice areas is more important than catching every single qualified lead because the operation is losing too much doing that on their own.

> Here’s what I did:
1) get the business knowledge by reading these books emyth or emyth attorney, dot com secrets, and the personal mba

2) choose your top service and systematize it from phone call to termination letter. Your goal is to create a rough initial standard operating procedure. It will be improved on over time but you need to start doing this asap

3) then do the same for the next top few service offerings

4) invest in systems that make you more efficient. I use (a) back office berries to answer & calls, schedule initial phone consultations and paid consults

5) have a very selective filtering mechanism early. I only do free 15 minute phone consultations.  ANYTHING in person is mandatory paid consult. I offer a deal of $350 for up to 90 mins but you choose. ANYTHING that requires me to review documents is a paid consultation. I get about 2-5 of these a month. 

5)  in your consult determine the top questions you need to determine whether this is a potential ideal client. If not, end the consult as soon as you can (respectfully of course). If so, make your offer in that initial consult. Don’t negotiate. Don’t talk any more about it. Simply, “it be my honor to help you with this, I charge a $10k retainer and bill $450/hour. If you’d like to move forward today I can email you my service agreement, Intake form, and invoice”

6) you need to have the minimum tech to make this as painless as possible for clients and you. I use Clio grow and Clio manage to schedule appointments, email retainer, email intake form, take payments, etc. you can use whatever you want but I guarantee you adding just these lead intake/sales SOPs and tech will make you like 20% more efficient almost immediately and increase revenue and efficiently over time 

7) you should be very anal about your cases. Say no to the cases that are not going to be profitable. If you want to help people or do pro bono keep that separate from your business. A business is only a business if it is profitable. Or else it’s a prison. 

8) focus on your business before paying any marketing, hiring people, etc.. you need to build the systems first, then invest in growth if you want. Having these systems will solve so many of the problems you mentions. 

Finally, remember the old bull/young bull story. Focus only on the case at a time. Slow if smooth and smooth is fast. So don’t be afraid to not answer phones. (Even better get an answering service).

> There are different understandings of solo "success". For one category of practitioners, "huge success" means maximizing profit for minimal effort. For another category of practitioners, financial success is as meaningful as the quality of service provided; money is important, but not everything. People seeking the latter success should consider the following:

\#1 - Pick up the phone. Take your clients' calls. Take unknown calls (prospective clients). Do it.

\#2 - Have a client pipeline. If you don't have the connections yet to get referral work...try a combination of sources: (a) look for contract work in your discipline (small governments such as cities and counties, as well as non-profits, often outsource their legal needs); and (b) supplement your practice with a handful of private cases. The private cases are likely to make more money than the contract, so you'll be excited at how it supplements the contract income. The contract work might generate leads who want to hire you privately. Very symbiotic. 

\#3 - Bill monthly. If you don't bill, you don't have money. If you aren't disciplined about accounting, outsource this. 

\#4 - Be motivated to solve problems. When a question arises for which you don't know the answer -- try find and answer, make some phone calls. If you don't like working, learning, and researching, then you  shouldn't be a solo. 

\#5 - Invest in your own productivity and comfort. Keeping overhead super low is pointless if you your work is inhibited and/or you're frustrated all the time because you have to do things the tedious way. When deficiency of equipment / software / space is costing you, resolve it. Buy the reliable printer. Rent the office that you feel good sitting in day after day. 

\#6 - Make your own appearances. This is related to #1. Do your own initial consultations. Make your own court appearances. Clients don't want to hire your staff, they want to hire you. You might be thinking that if you do this, you won't have time to take on as many clients...and that might end up being true, but you can charge way more for time, because clients will see the quality difference. 

\#7 - Be organized. Your efficiency (time is money) depends on this. Accurate billing depends on this. Your sanity depends on this. 

\#8 - Demonstrate your \[high\] quality in small ways. When you're a hot mess, clients know you're the wrong lawyer. So be mindful about your clothes, office appearance, even the bumperstickers on your car. At your office, have water/tea/coffee available for visiting clients. Use nice business cards. Air sophistication. 

\#9 - Consider how other lawyers see you. Other lawyers will (or won't) be referring clients to you, based on what they know about you. What they see from you can mean a lot for your business. 

\#10 - Rest. Make sure you have the fuel to be successful in the first place. Make boundaries to preserve your down time. When a terrible hearing gets avoided by a great resolution...treat yourse

> Yeah, VXT is a VoIP phone service designed for law firms that creates an ai summary and transcript. 

At the end of the call, it prompts you to tag the call to your practice management system with the matter number. 

It creates a call note in your practice management system with the transcript and summary and it creates a linked time entry that identifies the other party on the call.

I'm using both LEAP and Clio and am sending the notes and time entries to each platform.  I plan to ditch clio someday and am duping to leap and clio so that i don't have to migrate the data later. 

VXT works with many law practice management systems running the gamut from action step to Smokeball, Clio to Leap, and many others. 

If you go with an annual plan, it's $37.50 /user /month. On a month-by  -month plan it's $50/user/month. There’s an additional charge of $5 per phone number per month. But they tell me that one phone number can work for large firms with multiple users on separate calls simultaneously, so … I ported only one number and am dropping the other three I used for direct lines and a fax line. 

Over the past six years I've searched for and demoed several VoIP services and this is the best one I've found so far for a law firm. 

The other VoIP services I've looked at are really geared towards sales and call centers, rather than a law firm environment. 

To get them to create a communications log entry and a time entry most of them require either a third party connector or a zapier build. 

Homie ain’t got time nor patience for that. 

I've used DialPad for 2.5 years and i hate it. The interface is hard to navigate, i struggle to find calls in the call history, the call flow builder bites, it drops calls, the phone often doesn't ring and my staff just get a voicemail notification. 

Plus, dialpad within the past 6 months did something annoying that requires you to use a third party connector to send a communications log entry to clio. It doesn’t sync the ai summary. It just creates a blank communications log entry. 

 I never could get zapier to import the AI summary and Dialpad creates a separate time entry for each call participant and you then have to scrutinize the bill to ensure you’re not double or quadruple billing a call that involved multiple parties. 

Dialpad claims a low per user price of $25/month, but I get hit regularly with additional charges and fees that make the price comparable to or higher than VXT. 

Another VoIP I’ve found that designed for law firms is CORVUM. Lower cost, no frills interface that works with Clio. Its best feature is a text message billing module that creates a time entry based on the character count in a given day’s text exchanges with a particular number. 

But when i used it, CORVUM did not offer transcription and an ai summary. 

Before i switched to VXT I looked at over a dozen VoIP providers and created a “wet dream” list of features that a law firm VoIP needs and shouldn’t bother with.

> At many firms, paralegals do a lot of work that gets billed at lawyer rates.  When a new file comes in and a paralegal reads the complaint, realizes that it looks like the last 3 lawsuits filed by the same plaintiff's firm, pull the last answer filed in another case, then adapts the prior answer to the instant facts and hands the attorney a rough draft answer, and the attorney spends an additional 30 minutes to edit the document, add additional affirmative defenses the entire thing might get billed out as if the attorney did the whole thing.  If that service allows that lawyer to more hours per day there is value in that.  

In our Low Cost of Living Market most court awarded judgments for attorney's fees have paralegals at $175 to $225 and hour and most parelgals earn $50k to 75k.  

You should either charge more for every paralegal hour or pay your paralegal less.  A $117k salary for a $132/hr billiable rate is awful  Once you are over 100k of compensation why not hire a lawyer who you could bill out at much more than $132/hr.

That said, to answer your inquiry, hourly billing will always be a part of the provision of legal services.

> Can I give you an outside opinion?  I'm an independent remote law clerk.  I service attorneys across the USA and a few solicitors in the UK.  (I'm a dual citizen and I went to law school in both countries) I've clerked in a few state courts and I've also worked for office of the Public Defender.  I'm barred with a couple tribal courts in CA and WI and do family court work there.  With respect to the attorney I work with, I am clerking remotely whilst I study the for the bar.  I'm also a mom and I enjoy working from home and traveling extensively over the summer and still being able to work.  I love this work.  And I love the prospect of working in the same capacity (with higher rates) once I pass a state bar.

The attorneys I work with are all solo or small firms.  I have been a remote clerk for the past 16 months and I work on an ad hoc basis.  Sometimes this means working with one attorney for 2 weeks at a time, then nothing for months.

The work I do is drafting motions, appeals, complaints and lots of discovery.  I'm Lexis-certified so I also do lots of legal research.  I have my own robust Lexis and Westlaw access.   I'm not sure if there's a big difference between what I do and what a paralegal does - but I do have 2 law degrees (USA & UK).  I don't do filing or anything in PACER and I don't really do admin tasks.  I mean, if asked, I probably would, but my rate varies between $75-$95 per hour, and I think it's more economical to get an admin assistant to do the admin work. Also, I am now so busy with work I've had to hire my own assistant to help project manage my services.

When I first work with an attorney, I focus on providing a quality work product.  From doing that consistently, trust is built.  Some attorneys hand over parts of cases to me; some attorneys will hand over an entire case.  It really depends what's needed.  I don't have a personal preference here.

I'm NEVER the attorney on record (as I'm not an attorney). I'm simply a ghostwriter.  I've set up my own LLC and my own website, specifically working as a law clerk.  Once I pass the bar I will probably need a new marketing strategy.  

So my advice to any attorney who is outsourcing:

1. Find someone that you think you may be able to trust.

2. Give them a small project first, build the trust.  Scrutinize their work product.  Is the quality as good or better than you would submit?

  
3. Ask them if they use AI.  Ask how they use it, how they ensure privacy.  Ask how they ensure their citations aren't hallucinations from the AI.  They should have solid answers for this.

4. Ask about the terms of payment.  I bill my attorneys weekly.  I charge hourly but for big projects I will give a flat fee rate.

5. Speak to them on the phone before you engage them to do work.  This is helpful.  Some of the attorneys I work with I've never spoken to them on the phone but the relationship still works.

6. Ask them about insurance -- especially if they are sign as the attorney on record.

> Totally hear you on that, and appreciate the advice. I’m trying to keep overhead manageable while getting started. Currently paying for Adobe, Microsoft, a fax service, Dropbox, and a few other essentials. I'm even considering adding a virtual answering service soon. That said, I do think it’s important to invest in something that can help me track cases, manage deadlines, issue invoices, and monitor payments, especially since I’m handling some civil litigation and criminal defense matters that are billed hourly. The tricky part is that choosing the right software isn’t exactly straightforward, it takes time to test out each one, and then you inevitably get hit with a wave of follow-up emails and sales calls.

> I’m a bit of an outlier, bad lsat, bottom 50 school, could not get into a top 250 firm.  But I’m doing well financially, nearly 20 years in, definitely worth it.   Ask me ten years ago, I was in a dead end in house job and would have definitely eventually gotten laid off and would have given you a different answer.  It sounds bad, but the beginning of your career you learn how to be a competent attorney, but the ones who make money are better at client and work generation.  And honestly, some of the best and sharpest legal minds I have ever worked with just suck at this and they end up working for someone else and their salary is capped on how much they can work. 

I have a family member in medicine and it’s a different life. If you are in a major city, MBA’s have taken over the medical profession and it’s kind of similar. You get paid a high salary and work your butt off.  Unlike law, you can go to more rural areas and get paid a lot more, but you will have to also work harder and with less resources.  Whereas law needs to typically stay close to where the action is to generate clients. 

One difference is that it is harder to be an entrepreneur in clinical medicine. In the old days you can set up a GP office and do well.  Less so today, MBA run clinics and insurance providers have all the power, the money route is to become a specialist and work for a hospital that can pay you.  The profession really got screwed by business people. Doctors are incredibly smart and hard working, but they got played.  

With law, you can at least create your own office still and learn how to find and build a practice and get clients.  With the rates that big firms have (and the quality of work received), the opportunity to undercut them is there for small and medium sized firms.  The same AI is being used by the associates in both firms, it’s just the billing rate that is different if you pay for brand name.  

So with what I know now, there is more opportunity in law for disruptive services and a better work life balance compared to other areas like medicine.  Not to mention that the entry level cost and time for medicine is much higher, so also cost out the lost income there.   If you are great at studying and just grinding and taking abuse, you can do well in both, but if you think you are more business minded and see law as a service to be sold, it can have more upside than medicine.

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

> I'm an attorney and do IT consulting for lawyers.  We specialize in small practices.  Here are some of the things I have learned over the years.  I have toying with the idea of doing a weekly tech live chat just to answer questions.

* Be prepared to do a lot of business stuff.  I have had a couple small and solos go back in house because they were just "tired of running a business" Others, really love the business part.  It isn't overly complex but it does take up time.  
* Set your tech up right and automate as much as you can.  There are a lot of good posters on this subreddit who give amazing advice.  Gusto for payroll and taxes, FreshBooks for time tracking and payment, QuickBooks online, Office 365 and so on.  Partner up with a good tech support company in your area.  *Make sure they use a program to backup Office365 for you*
* Cashflow is king, so work out how you will bill the client.  Local rules may determine your options.  I take our fee prior to the month of service.  I have seen some firms that will send an invoice and then auto bill a credit card at determined period of time, unless there is a complaint with the invoice.
* Costs and taxes will always be more than you anticipate.  You will have to pay more in taxes than you think.
* Try to get your contacts and mail exported from your old firm.  Partners usually get this.  Your professional contacts will be critical
* Make sure you have thought through your sales pipeline so that you always have new cases coming in.  Most partners leaving firms know their practice and know how to make it rain, so you will probably be fine.

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck, owning a business is amazing but it takes a lot effort.

> I really liked that Daylite was offline with a sync.  I know when I fire it up on my phone or tablet it will be there.  Clio requires a constant internet connection.  I also liked Daylite mail attachment as Clio’s is so slow as to be virtually unusable.  There’s also little things like being able to link a person or a project (matter) with a calendar date.  Clio only links matters to  calendar dates.  I dunno, I sometimes think about going back, but the billing aspects of Clio make me overlook the CRM’s flaws compared to Daylite.  And as previously stated Billings Pro sucks and one is just waiting for Marketcircle to announce that they won’t support it anymore. 

Clio customer service is also better.  They have live people to answer calls where everything with Daylite is done via email.  Sometimes that was frustrating even though I cannot fault Marketcircle’s response time overall.

> The most honest answer if being practical on it is a combination of working on many different matters each day and the rounding up of time based on the usual .1 hour increments. All the more basis of there being a general notion of not billing for just .1 to a matter in one day. It's all BS and dumb when you get down to it. I used to do work on antenna license matters and could be juggling 15 or more at a time. If I shot out an email for each checking to status each weekday, despite it only taking 20 min or less to blast those out it would end up, according to protocol 3 hours. Naturally, can't do that all the time but merely as an example of filling in the time. 

Personally, I'm at the stage of my career and at a place where ultimate collections rather than billable hours is the measuring stick so it has its own host of considerations when prioritizing and tracking down work (if not servicing my own clients).

> If you have work coming in then it's never too early to hire.

Start by hiring an assistant to answer phones, set up consultations, handle intake and opening a new case file. This person, if they have a nice personality, can also handle client inquiries, answer (non-legal) questions, and take messages.

As time progresses you will train the assistant to prepare documents from templates, and how to file with the court. Of course you review pleadings before approving a filing, but having someone to prepare documents and organize files is a big deal.

As you grow, the assistant may also help with billing tasks. I would recommend a separate bookkeeper or accountant to actually handle the money, but an assistant can make sure that billing statements and requests for payment go out on time to keep your money coming in.

I consider a paralegal to be a separate position. There is a lot of blurring between roles and tasks, but a good paralegal should be able to talk to clients, do legal research, and draft substantive legal arguments for your review. An untrained assistant who doesn't know legal  can not be expected to do those things. 

Some attorneys will hire a person to do intake interviews, which is kind of like a consultation but without giving legal advice. The purpose is to vet the client, assure them that your firm can take care of their matter, give them an idea of what to expect next, and get them to sign up and make a deposit of funds (for hourly work). This is like a sales role and is kind of advanced in terms of training required. 

Admin work? 

Use a service like Gusto to handle employee pay. 

Set up a separate account at your bank that's just for payroll.

Make a checklist of tasks that new employee will have to do. One of new employee's jobs will be to expand the checklist with "how-to" descriptions for everything they do. This document will be come the manual for your law office, so that new hires can refer to it, and so that you can edit and correct any mistakes in employee assumptions or conduct. 

Helpful to offer a lower hourly rate for training pay, then rate bumps up after new hire can complete tasks A, B, and C. Don't make the tasks too hard or the employee will think you're playing games. A bump in pay will come for demonstrating they can reliably do tasks G, H, and I. 

New employee has to understand confidentiality, conflicts, and the difference between legal information and legal advice. Tell them "when in doubt refer questions to the attorney!" "Don't make predictions or give legal advice!"

Have them sign a confidentiality agreement. Prepare a welcome letter in advance, that spells out terms of employment and probably emphasizes that the position is "at-will" employment. 

All of the topics I've mentioned here are the subjects of numerous books, webinars, training programs, business coaches, etc. This post is intended just to get you thinking.

Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

> I’ve used Clio for 3+ years and now hate it. 

Calendaring sucks. Color coding is lame, you can’t set a template for reminders, and several other shortcomings. 

Tasks in Clio are an afterthought. 

Clio Grow blows and integrates poorly with Clio manage. Grow’s tedious form builder you can’t build a form such that a client can enter useful information, e.g. witness names / addresses / age / expected testimony, because to gather such information in the form you have to program the form to obtain info about a pre-existing contact. 

In Grow you should be able to create custom fields as you build an automated document. 

No. 

First you must create custom fields. Surely you can create custom fields while building an intake form ! Right?

No. 

You can, but should not, creat custom fields in Grow at all. 

Stupidly, a custom field created with Grow will not import into Manage. 

So…
You create custom fields in Manage, import those custom fields into Grow, link form fields to the custom fields, and then build the automated document. 

I paid Clio to build intake forms at $50 each for 5 areas of law.

Pretty forms. Good data. But…

The forms asked for times, dates, integers, contact cards, picklist responses, multiple choice answers, yes/no responses, radio buttons, etc. 

All incompatible with both the Grow document automation tool and with Manage altogether. 

So, pretty, useless forms contained data that I had to cut-and-paste or re-type, which was the very evil I sought to avoid by biting into Clio so that I could automate. 

I’ve spent DAYS with Clio tech support calls and Clio remand Bo better than Microsoft outlook or Google Workspace. It does billing, but WiseTime, Bill4Time, and others do billing at a lower point. 

Often, One tech support person has told me to do steps 1,2, and 3 to unlock a Clio capability. Several hours later I run into a hiccup, call tech support, and another tech support person tells me I should have done it differently from the start.

Wasted time, money, and effort. 

After several sessions with Clio development teams to resolve basic issues and explain what a lawyer needs to leverage CLIO and the data lawyers need to store in such a tool I am going to fire Clio and opt for a better solution. 

Clio has neither provided the service promised nor made my work easier. 

When I’ve emailed the CEO about my issues i get pawned off to another time-wasting tech support “expert” or development team. 

Clio lacks pre-built, automated court forms, intake forms, and data collection templates. 

I’ve created thousands of custom fields, several dozen automated documents, and it’s been a waste. 

During your Clio free trial find a product that has pre-built data collection and automated documents. 

Smokeball and LEAP look superior to Clio. If they don’t already have the document or form you need,  LEAP and Smokeball will take your existing form, letter, document, or pleading and automate it. 

LEAP has a large, expanding body of cour

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

> This is a terrible idea. Don’t even consider it. Run. 


Source: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer 

Okay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn’t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:


The only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. 

You will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. 


*Why hours on just this?*


Because a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you’ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you’ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). 

This will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. 


*How do you bill 2100?!?!*


Oh boy… you will hear the phrase “capture your time” and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don’t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you’ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn’t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn’t billable and will add up as you’re learning). 


If the mind numbing work and hours don’t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS

You can’t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It’s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. 


ID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate

> Let me clarify. The high anxiety comes from a number of factors, that when all combined, tends to increase the anxiety levels. 1. New cases in the pipeline, 2. Budgets, 3. Client demands (whether ppl here admit it or not, u r ur clients, attorney/therapist/medical liaison/ financial planner/ person they will vent to about whatever and some require hand holding.) 4. Managing the endless problems other parties throw your way all in the name of maximizing the value you get on your case (I.e billing departments, managing experts etc). And 5) ordinary litigation stressors (which isn’t too bad). 

Those PI attorneys that you are referring to as having less stress have probably built their practices up where they have a robust staff that can address all of the things I listed above. But anyone worth their a damn will tell you, building a PI practice and generating business requires more than sitting in an office answering discovery, motions and doing deps. 

PI is incredibly profitable. But its a business first. And most ppl mess up bc they don’t appreciate the demands servicing clients places on someone. While also joggling all the other stuff.

> Better be checking and double checking that you are indeed getting all of the procedural credit- most times things are missed and you get paid less because of it if you get a %of production or collection and the other doc be profiting off of your work. 
Three months should have been plenty of time for Credentialing to have been completed if they submitted your paperwork when you started or prior to. Most insurances state 90d  although it usually takes 30. Going out of network is a whole different ballgame- best believe they will take their 90d to uncredential. 

Technically it could be considered insurance fraud under the False Claims Act and prompt an audit and fines if reported under certain circumstances. It depends. Are they billing under an individual NPI or a group NPI? What do the individual insurance contracts allow for? Is it an insurance that specifically states the services can only be performed by contracted providers? May want to look into the answer to at least these questions. Or contact an attorney in your state now that you know it’s happening and ask them.

> For me, it's about a few things:

1. I get better support from customer service, tech support, etc from straumann or nobel than I might with Implant direct.

2. Straumann and Nobel have been around for 30 years, and they are going to be around for 30 more.  Can you say the same for the other companies? Short answer is no. If you have to restore a now defunct brand, that's no fun.

  
3. A patient with a Straumann or Nobel can get it restored with relatively little fuss in any state and pretty much any country.  Before Neodent was bought by Straumann, this was harder for Neodent being a Brazilian company.

  
4. Cost is the point. If I'm charging 3k for a crown but I pay $99 for the lab fee, that doesn't feel great. It's like getting your Car repaired - If I go to a mechanic to get my car fixed and its a $1000 bill and I see the breakdown of cost and the parts were $950 and labor was $50, I'm going to think I got a great deal.  If the Parts were $50 and labor was $950, I'll think I got ripped off.  Human nature works like this. I can charge $2600 to place a $600 implant much easier than I can charge $2050 to place a $50 implant even though I get paid the same.

  
5. It's what I would get in my own mouth.

> Are you even a dental professional? 

Dental offices do charge both the patient and their insurance if the insurance doesn't pay for 100% of the treatment. You'll be quite surprised how people miraculously forget, on the spot, that dental offices provide something called an, "estimate" of coverage for procedures. Billing and dealing with insurance benefits is an incredible administrative burden. 

Do you think it's fun when we can't access an insurance company's website to check your insurance benefits on your behalf because of a website outage? Do you think it's fun when you have to wait for long periods of time for customer service to pick up the phone and answer your question? Imagine having to do that in a high volume office where you lose a lot of money writing things off because some patient is haggling over five dollars that wasn't covered by their insurance.

Yes, not all dental offices charge equally. Whether it be due to their speciality/services provided, or they are an HMO, PPO, fee for service (cash) office, there will be disparity in the fees. You have less invasive treatments like dental fillings costing hundreds of dollars more than the average because a patient wants to be IV sedated. All that additional equipment and staff costs money. Not all insurance companies pay and provide coverage equally.

> HEADS UP: This is long....but from the heart. 

Many Doctors ARE arrogant, and act highly offended if a patient asks questions about their treatment. That's the reaction patients are put off by. 

Unfortunately,  many patients mistakenly believe Doctors know EVERYTHING about the science behind ALL of the products they use. So their questions,  I believe, are from a place of innocence, not challenge or suspicion.

Think of a way to answer questions you have no answer for in a way that will assure them & quiet them down, but not lose faith/trust in you. It's a slippery slope. You, the doctor, have to assess the situation.  

And yes, patients may ask questions about things beyond their pay grade; while being mindful of your time, ask if they want the long or short answer and go from there.

If they question EVERYTHING, perhaps you need to offer to schedule a consultation appointment (cash) with a knowledgeable staff member to go over the complete treatment plan and provide a handout with answers to basic innocuous questions.  That way you're not taking up chairtime or taking too much of the Doctors' time away from patients. 

I've done that many times. It's actually quite fun. 

Perhaps the patient could be required to submit a list of questions so the Doctor can answer the questions beforehand.  

Having demonstration typodonts, visual diagrams/drawings and other teaching aids is helpful too. 

In one office I worked in we had a special consultation room just for this purpose.  Every patient got one.

Just remember too much information leads to information overload. 

Simply explain you'd love to address their concerns, and need to set up an appointment (probably not covered by ins) to do that. Here are the fees.....are you interested? PIF is expected at time of appointment. Otherwise you can answer simple, basic questions as they arise. 

Personally,  I'd  recommend no less than 45 mins to an hour so they don't feel rushed. Plus, if it's not the Doctor giving the presentation,  you won't have to charge as much to where it might be cost prohibitive.  

If they start asking too many "deep" questions,  simply explain the person doesn't have a dental license and can't give medical/ dental advice.....only what the Dr. has authorized her to share. 

There's a saying that goes something like......
Most people won't remember what you did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel. 

Make your patients feel valued, appreciated, special and worthy of your time. I'll bet their beaming feelings will be included in their referrals.  

You never know who might be walking through you dental office doors next.  

Yes, it requires lots of time & pampering, but look at how super successful dental practices are known to go way above & beyond for those who want it and are willing to pay for it.  However, a good billing coder might find ways to get insurance to pay for some of these services.

> Our default policy is you get one free pass per ~5 year period as long as your reason seems legitimate and apologetic in tone. We modify that by the patient. If they have been coming for 8 years reliably, pay their bills, friendly, etc. I’m more forgiving. If we believe excuses like my spouse died, I have Covid, etc. we don’t even count that as their one freebie. 

We reiterate our 24 hour business day policy (Sunday for Monday doesn’t count as notice for us) nearly all cancellation calls and before booking anything over 1.5 hours.

Invariably, someone winds up with multiple under 24 hour cancels/no shows. We charge a $75 cancellation when it happens and require deposits of 1/2 the planned tx for the appointment. When they complain, and they always do, the front is told to tell them only the dentist can remove the charge and would they like to speak with me. If I’m not currently available, they get a call back number for that day. I always take the call or call them back…if they are too emotional/irrational to listen, I have the staff get their number whether I am available or not so they cool down some.

Most people just don’t understand the business structure. We’re not like Walmart with a cashier standing there for whatever comes in. I explain that I or the hygienist reserve special time for just them. When they call at the last minute, I still have to pay that hygienist and assistant to just sit there and do nothing as I have no opportunity to get someone else in that we can help. I tell them everyone wants dentistry to be less costly and that this is the number one thing that makes it cost more and we are trying to keep their costs down. They invariably say something about $75 being too much. I then tell them the precise number of times they did it and to think of it instead as $/each time and how we graciously gave them multiple passes before. Then it’s the, “yeah but this time my house flooded!” (Which is usually a bs made up answer if they didn’t start with it in which case we likely would have accepted the excuse and moved on before I’m involved) in which case I answer I’m very sorry to hear that, but your house didn’t flood the other 14 times and I have to draw the line somewhere. Sometimes I will pull out the this has to be a mutual respect relationship. You love that I never leave you sitting in my waiting room more than 6 minutes because I respect your time, you must respect my time as well….and you aren’t. I rarely reverse the charge because I give my well-trained front the latitude to assess the situation and decide whether to go down the charge or deposit path.

I’ve never had a bad review over it, which frankly surprises me as this has been my approach for nearly 10 years. Probably lost some patients over it though, but I don’t want those patients. Let them mess up someone else’s schedule. I tell them that too when they threaten to leave (I’d love to continue being your dentist, but honestly I would rather you find another provid

> NAD, this isn’t the answer you’re looking for but offering a pov from someone with dental defects. I’d suggest looking into medical billing and coding for oral healthcare. 

There’s such a lack of knowledge in this area at practices and most dentists are afraid to tackle medical insurance/suggest the patient to do it. 

There are lots of CPT that are mirror to CDT codes beyond implants or bone grafting etc. Even restorations are truly considered prosthetics. 

Dental care is not an essential benefit, but congenital defects are and habilitation services for functional impairment. Someone with a peg lateral has a birth defect so a crown is considered prosthetic intervention and can be argued to medical insurance that the primary purpose is to correct congenital defects. 

At this point you wouldn’t even need to have a contract with the insurance yet because you can have patients petition you in network under network gap exception. There’s no other dentist, perio, or pros doing this so the network doesn’t have a provider. You then can work with a rep or have the patient ask about the max allowable amounts to figure out your rates. 

Beyond that, there’s also just preventative services, X-rays, cbct scans, services related to dental caries that all have icd-10 codes and cpt codes. 

The reason why I’m suggesting this as a business opportunity. Because being the only practice that does this could be a big deal.

On top of that, the ELSA Act is hopefully going to pass Congress this year. So a lot of dental practices won’t even know about this legislation let alone the insurance they could be using to help patients from it 

Final and last point, dental insurance has gotten ridiculous at this point. Between them covering nothing, the push for corporate dental chains, the ridiculously low out of pocket maximums, and the low contracted amounts it’s an archaic institution where medical insurance could be the future of oral care.

> We were about 60% Delta. Since Delta doesn’t accept assignment (at least in our state) from out of network providers we now collect payment in full at time of service and the reimbursement check goes directly to the patient. That has eliminated any follow up on unpaid claims. We do bill for the patient electronically, but after that we have no further involvement in if they get paid. (Unless more info is requested or something clinical we need to submit)The pt has to call Delta to follow up on payment for themselves. So that is a massive time saver. And we found most of our patients didn’t mind paying at time of service(in full) they just really didn’t want to have to bill Delta. Once they realized we were still billing for them they were fine with it. 

We we have much better customer service and quality of care  because we have less patients we see in a day. We have increased the amount of quality time we can spend with each patient and not feel rushed. Our employees aren’t as stressed running around and it shows in their more personal interactions with the patients. 

Happy to answer any questions, anytime. Good luck!

> For posterity, here is their full comms to customers:




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Customer,

As announced, VoIPo will be ceasing operations effective August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Our top priority is to make sure that you have minimal disruption and that your phone number is easily transferred to a new provider. We highly recommend VoIP.ms, an established telecommunications provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers. The VoIP.ms team is ready to help and has taken several steps to make sure things are seamless for you. We believe VoIP.ms will provide you with excellent service, customer support, and competitive rates.

With that said, we understand you might have pressing questions concerning your account, the reason we are shutting down operations and billing issues. We have prepared some questions and answers we believe are more urgent concerning this matter.

 

General Questions

Q: Why is VoIPo ceasing operations? 

A: Due to challenging market conditions, significant financial losses, and a key vendor disrupting our ability to process credit cards or issue refunds, we can no longer operate. This was a hard and difficult decision made after exploring all available options.

Q: When exactly does my VoIPo service end?

A: All VoIPo telecommunications services will permanently cease on August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Q: What if I have billing or other questions about my old VoIPo account?

A: VoIPo will provide limited support through closing via e-mail at support@voipo.com.

Q: When should I start migrating to another provider?

A: Immediately. The sooner you begin, the smoother your transition will be, otherwise you might suffer longer service interruptions.

Q: What do I do with my VoIPo adapter?

A: VoIPo is not requiring the return of any equipment. You may use the equipment with VoIP.ms (or any other provider) if they support it or dispose of/recycle it.

 

Migration to VoIP.ms Questions

Q: Can VoIP.ms access my VoIPo account to help?

A: No. VoIP.ms cannot access your VoIPo account information or resolve VoIPo-related issues.

Q: Why is VoIPo recommending VoIP.ms?

A: VoIP.ms is a well-established provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers, excellent service quality, competitive pricing, and the technical capability to handle VoIPo customer migrations smoothly. Learn more about VoIP.ms right here: https://migration.voip.ms/voipo.

Q: Will VoIP.ms honor VoIPo's rates/contracts?

A: No. VoIP.ms operates independently with their own pricing and terms. However, their rates are competitive and often lower than industry standards. See https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost and https://voip.ms/pricing. 

Q: Will my current equipment work with VoIP.ms?

A: Most equipment will work with VoIP.ms, but will need reconfiguration (ie. factory reset). VoIP.ms built this extensive knowledgebase article to h

> Currently stuck with a local VoIP provider that’s decent at best and “meh” at worst. It worked fine for a while, but now we’re running into issues they don’t care to fix or upgrade. So, I’m looking for suggestions for a VoIP service that can actually handle the following:

1.	Call Queue Feature: Apparently, handling overflow calls during busy times is too futuristic for our current provider. We need a queue system that works without relying on smoke signals.

2.	Mobile App: An iPhone app that lets us answer and transfer calls on the go without needing a degree in rocket science to set up.

3.	IVR Maintenance: Something where I can update greetings for holidays or change call routing without summoning the IT gods.

4.	Support That Doesn’t Ghost: Fast responses via chat or email—because waiting 24+ hours for a reply is not customer service, it’s torture.

We’re in the USA if that matters for anything other than billing. Does anyone use a VoIP service that doesn’t make you want to pull your hair out? Let me know—bonus points if the setup doesn’t require an IT team!

Edit: we have 6 employees

### r/VOIP — 2024-09-17 | 1pts | Mentions: **Vonage**

> # Looking for best home VOIP service with an ethernet phone that I won't lose control of my phone number.

I am hoping for some help and guidance. I still have a landline number that I, from a career in the wireless industry, know is my property via number portability and I want to keep this number. For years I have had my number at Vonage and am getting sick of the $35/month bill for a number that is basically parked and forwarded to my cellphone number.

That said, there are some changes in my home setup now as I have been working from home for the last 4 years and my work desk phone is here on my desk for conference calls and other calls I make via ethernet to my internet connection (Verizon Fios). My company has used Nextiva, but is sick of paying the bill and is ditching the desk phones and going all computer MS Teams for communications/calls.

What I am looking for is to have a business-feature/style phone on my desk with my landline number. I would like to use the VoIP ethernet connection I have set up. I researched this a couple of years ago and liked the SNOM phones (like the D735). I would like to get to a cheaper VoIP service where they can't steal my phone number from me (I have heard that Nextiva and Google Voice have done this to people). I don't need fancy features for VoIP service, just unlimited (or a high minute number) minutes, ability to forward to my cellphone when I don't answer my desk phone, and VM I guess. Open to VoIP provider and phone maker suggestions. Thanks!

This may answer a lot of interconnect questions. If you’re trying to get low level. If you want to be a CLEC, you need to connect your phone switch (could be soft phone switch(sip))to a tandem phone switching network. On top of that you will also require a connection for e911 services in the area your providing service and routing to them. 

Then also all the billing and legal items everyone talks about.

> VoIP can easily accomplish this. We do it all the time using SIP Trunking (Telnyx, Twilio, VoIP Innovations, etc) and a server running FreePBX. SIP Trunking is where a provider sells a service to connect a computer/server PBX to telephone lines. There are many providers for SIP Trunking and many different hosted PBX platforms, but we find FreePBX to be simple and many features. A PBX is a computer/server/appliance that operates a physical phone system and contains all your programming, to make your extensions/apps/phones connect and pass that on to the SIP Trunking provider. Then we add a mobile app called SangomaTalk (aka Sangoma Connect). There are many softphone/mobile apps that you can use also (Linphone comes to mind if you want a free one or your provider doesn’t have a branded app), but we have found the ease of setup, security, and call quality on SangomaTalk to be superior to others in our testing on our equipment. 

The USA companies I mentioned above also operate internationally and with international numbers, but someone can maybe point you to a German provider than can do the same for a better rate and better matching your needs/taxes/etc. 

However, what you are asking for is extremely simple and should be available in any Cloud PBX offering. A cloud PBX is often sold with the SIP Trunking and PBX together as a single purchase. Everything is in the cloud, so you don’t buy any equipment. And it is priced per extension. 

You need:

1 phone number (often called a DID)
1 inbound route (programs what happens on PBX when DID called - points to ring group)
1 ring group (can ring all extensions simultaneously, sequentially, etc)
3 extensions (this is usually what you pay for when you setup this kind of service $/mo/ext)

Then decide what happens to unanswered calls. This is setup in the ring group. I assume they go to a single voicemail if all 3 extensions miss the call. But the unanswered call could also go to an automated attendant (press 1, 2, 3 system) and then go to multiple voicemails or different places based on the digit pressed by the caller. 

Outbound calls for each extension will just be setup to show your main number. This is called CNAM (caller name and number). Some providers refer to this as caller id masking but that is really an improper use of that term with VoIP and more refers to when people have multiple copper telephone lines. 
3 extensions (and, 3 mobile apps free or licensed)

If the app is proprietary then they will just send you a link to click on and setup is usually automatic. If you use a free app, then you’ll have a server address, username, and password to enter in the app. 

When you receive a call it will ring in the mobile app (this is a SIP client that works just like a desk phone). You would have options like answering calls, transferring between extensions, hold, conference, transfer to outside number, recording, etc. When you place an outbound call you just use the app and people will see your busines

> April 2024:  
I agree with most of your assessment. Even during the business hours the person answering the chat works for some BPO. Even calling their advertised support number and trying to get a certain department you will most likely be answered by tier 1 support who doesn't actually work in that department (E.g. selecting LNP option and still getting the same person who couldn't help during a chat session).

Their first line of support will chat will with their internal team and then just read back what the internal team wrote, clearly not understanding what they're actually saying. I guess it's better than nothing, but still not great. Any time I need to actually get something done I just automatically call my account rep to get it escalated. Urgency doesn't seem to register with support chat. They will just say some canned response like "the team is working on it."

I used to have thousands of numbers with them, but switched to another carrier a couple of years ago. Mostly used Telnyx for a few services and a backup for outbound. Too many call quality issues that would constantly need route updates. When you're managing thousands of end users, you really don't have time to constantly supply call samples  only for them to wait past 72 hours and then have them ask for another one. I moved to another carrier and have had almost zero issues with call quality since (at least as far as carrier related issues!). Makes life a lot easier not getting inundated with tickets from customers to then have to troubleshoot at the local network level with another IT company and then to go to Telnyx for support and ask them to fix. 

I want to be fair to Telnyx and say they do have some useful features. Debugging/Call reports work well mostly. Access to invoices is easy. Setting up different SIP trunks and outbound profiles is simple. 

The biggest issues I had with Telnyx:  
-Numbers were given to another Telnyx without any notification. Months went by until the customer brought to my attention that one of their spare numbers didn't work. It was active in my account and was being charged the whole time. Support couldn't explain why it was in 2 different customer accounts and wouldn't give it back. This was part of a customers block of 100 DID's that they ported in a couple years before that. Customer didn't put p much of a fight so I gave up trying to get a resolution.   
-Numbers were ported away without notification for months while still being charged and marked as "active" in my account.  
-Needed to work out billing issues in which Telnyx had to refund thousands of dollars for. We had to bring this to their attention and their response time isn't very good.   
-Too many call quality issues. Switching our traffic to another carrier was the only real resolution for us. It wasn't the ISP, it wasn't the LAN. Too many of the same symptoms across too many customers. All resolved by switching carriers.

I suppose it's normal for a company to have tickets get

> As others have noted, short duration call penalties are for *outgoing* calls, as a way to either deter or better monetize cold callers, scammers, etc. who tend to get hung up on a lot.

It should not be coming up in the context of incoming calls unless you're immediately forwarding those calls out somewhere else making them count as both.

If that's what's happening, like you're immediately forwarding to an answering service where the caller then hangs up, stop doing that and land it first on an IVR or something that can provide the basic details and then only forwards out if the caller selects to speak to a human.

If you really aren't doing anything like that then I'd suggest checking your call records to ensure you aren't dealing with a compromised system where someone else is using it to scam people.

If neither of those are the case and it really is just inbound calling then I'd take it to a billing rep and consider changing carriers if they can't help.

> **Moving from RingCentral and looking for an alternative.**  


The issue with RingCentral isn't really the cost but the reliability. A lot of calls are missed where the app never rings on desktop or mobile. Mobile app is always logging us out etc.

Have a small team of 5 and currently have a business Phone solution with RC. We have 3 numbers. We're going to start utilizing a reception service that we pay for as part of our virtual office.

Ideally we would forward our main number calls to the receptionist service so when someone calls main number, the receptionist will answer. Example - caller would say they want to get on to billing and the receptionist would forward that call to one of the other numbers where, whoever on the team is assigned to that number on the system will receive the phone call on the VOIP system.

Would like to be able to configure it in such a way that in the event that person does not answer, we can set a voicemail or even forward the call to another number.

We don't make a lot of outgoing calls but in the event that the person in billing makes a call from the number they are assigned to, can the voip solution mask that number so it looks like the call is coming from the main number?

Last requirement would need to be mobile apps.

Located in Canada if that makes a difference.

> >Does this mean we're never, ever able to recommend businesses or alternatives when posters ask questions? 

You are 100% allowed to recommend businesses when replying to requests in the monthly requests thread.

Otherwise if someone asks "How do I do X with provider Y?" and you respond with "You should use provider Z instead", you are breaking the rules.

If someone is looking for help solving a specific problem, it is never acceptable to recommend alternatives. It **is** however perfectly fine to say "this is a problem inherent to Service XYZ. The only solution is to change providers." This answers the question without promoting any particular competitor.

&#x200B;

>the way you are thinking of doing this is way overkill, I would recommend going with \[insert name of commonly used Voip service\] for this 

Is the "overkill" solution *the only way to do it* within the OP's ecosystem? If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say "Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider. If you want a different solution you will have to find a new business to work with."

&#x200B;

> So we're never allowed to mention names of Voip services, SIP apps, number parking services, etc. etc. outside of the quarantined threads? Is that what I'm reading? 

No. Discussions of business, services and products is not only allowed, but encouraged. The only stipulation is that it must be *on topic* and not promotional.

For example:

Someone asks "Which of these three PBXs can be integrated with Provider XYZ?"

Here is a good reply:

"XYZ Telecom, VoIP Provider W, and ABC123 all work. I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\_to\_website or you will have a bad time."

Here is a bad reply:

"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support"

One of them answers the question ("Which can be integrated?") while also giving helpful insight ("some settings misbehave"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.

If on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment" is fine, because the API requiring PHP

> wow this got hot! To be clear i’m not complaining about their actual product or pricing! I’m very satisfied there and with their API! It works for what I do, it is reliable, and the pricing fits what I need well. Doesn’t have to be the cheapest but to be clear CEO it’s a good set of products! I’m very satisfied there! 

I just wish it felt more like a partnership then calling Comcast! 

I’m not sure I want to divulge the details of my individual tickets, either here or in DM…. I don’t want to be wake up and see my account cut and be left high and dry overnight! This got a lot hotter then intended. I’m not prepared with any backup! I am totally reliant on Telnyx for my entire business core offerings. 

But I’m really glad it got your attention! I like to hear that there have been a round of investments in support, that’s a positive response! But seriously it’s lacking so so much, it hurts my heart because I like the product so much for what I do! It’s great! But man are the simplest questions so hard to get direct answers to! Like a recent inquiry just for something like “Hey what’s the billing rate for this service?” Over a week, first ticket just died with zero response… and i feel like it took near harassment by me to get the answer! But like wow, imho it’s the most simple of questions! I do have most tickets unresolved and they have just died. That seems to be extremely common with my tickets. I really like the companies that harass me about open tickets! lol I think everyone in tech knows those companies… 

CEO - Why not offer a premium support option? Like in tiers? Kinda like AWS does? What I experience is fine for some free level perhaps, but when shit hits the fan I wanna get a hold of someone asap to work with me to resolve the issue on one call! And I want quick escalations, (like after 20 minutes with tier 1). If you already do offer this, please make it dead simple to sign up online and subscribe to one a monthly billing basis! I don’t wanna talk to sales! lol… I’d pay $50-$100 a month for support one step up where someone personally gets assigned my ticket and works it and follows up daily until resolved. And not those automated updates that are like “Hey we’re working on your issue”… IMHO that response is trash and just pisses me off! They don’t count as a response to me at all, they just irritate me and remind me I have an open ticket that will probably never ever get human eyes on it again. 

My opinion and recommendation would be to focus and track one call close metrics, and work on that metric a lot! Then there would be no follow up issues, but why not do LIVE escalations on the tickets? Try hard for that one call close please! i realize that’s isn’t always possible but damn I’ve asked some dead simple questions, that result in let me get back to you, and then it dies. Your beat chance for “great” service is one call close imo! 

I think i’ll just enter all my future tickets as P1’s and see if that helps! Although support will

> This is your answer.   I work for a VoIP company and several clients want to go as cheap as possible.  They buy the phone outright and only pay for monthly service and do not pay for support or the phone lease cost.  The least expensive I have seen this cost (including all VoIP companies I know) is about $18 a month.  The company I work for charges $25 (you cannot remove support but then we offer to manage your phonebook as well).  So you'll have to ask around.

Just remember that they provide instructions usually only once to get you online.  If you have any issues after install, they bill per (half) hour for support.  With my company, we usually recommend at least a Yealink T46S (as the T26P or T28P are now too EOL).  You can find these on Amazon for $95-$105 and power supply for $10-$18 (you need the 5V 2A one).

A more helpful question could be: "should my contract have clear billing terms, including a clause for billing when my service is not heavily utilized."


The answer to that question is definitely yes 😅 I do not recommend working off-contract, even for people you trust.

> For what it’s worth, if you ever wanted to sell the agency, a question you’ll encounter is revenue per service, per client. So having these broken out by line item can make this answer much, much easier. 

Each service probably has a different profitability. So, for internal purposes and aligning headcount, this can also be useful.

Personally, we invoice per line item but it’s a fixed cost in most cases so we don’t bill hourly.

> I've been using HighLevel for a few years now and I love it. 

It is primarily for agencies to use as the back end automation for their clients. It has everything from scheduling, a homegrown website/funnel builder (better than Clickfunnels IMO), text and email automation, they are even developing a service that can replace Zapier in some instances. Oh yeah, and wordpress hosting too. Oh, and social media posts and scheduling. ...and google my business comment replies...

Honestly, I can't even remember all of the features because there are so many, haha!

And to answer your question, yes, you can whitelabel it with your own brand and domain. They even have a SaaS mode where you can whitelabel billing, etc. Happy to answer any questions about it - but I highly recommend it. It replaces so many different tools it practically pays for itself.

> First of all thanks for commenting and to the other person on this comment chain what you already discussed with eachother has been helpful.

I think you answered most of my question even though I didn't express myself clearly. Let me clarify:

There's 2 things I want to know:

- How in general consultants tackle multiple clients and is my situation unqiue or are there other approaches (i.e you secure contract work that is billed per devliberable/project instead of daily rates comes to my mind.. as then you can just focus on the deliverable instead of billable hours and you don't need to worry how you juggle things as long as the work is done or what you suggested.. tracking 20 hours or however much your worked and saying you're unavailable the rest of the day etc. if you have work with another client or some 3rd approach which i dont know about etc.)

I'm asking this quesiton because either I'm doing something wrong or I have unrealistic expecations for what actually is consultant work, so I needed more clarity on that. If my situation is pretty standard and most clients need you to be dedicated the typical 40hours per week and you're billed per hours worked on their project then consultancy is probably not for me as I'd rather get the benefits of being a fulltime employee. For me the idea of consultancy is to be able to offer a service and have multiple clients (as long as you can deliver to all of them) and not be billed on hours worked but rather on results and deliverables, in fact you should be rewarded if you can deliver something faster with the same quality.

- The second question is regarding my specific scenario which to be honest is also not fully clear to me... I haven't actually started work on the project. On the one side we're talking about a project that is say 9months long fixed-term with a target deliverable, on the other side they want me to track billable hours and pay me on that. 

I'm sorry but if I'm ready with all deliverables at the 3 month mark, why would i deliver it then if im being payed by the hour? Wether I stretch my work hours to be longer to collect a full pay check, or just be a perfectionist so everything takes me twice as long, there is no incentive to actually complete the work as fast as possible.This is why I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. 

What you said if I do have a second client is what I'll do - be upfront about it with the first hour and tell them I won't be available for meetings with them if I'm already busy and in meetings with the second client OR if they're really expecting me to be 8hours dedicated all day to them I'll simply decline any adittional clients as I wouldn't have the capacity for both and I'll probably look for another altenrative path in the future.. either billing per project or something else.

My intention is not to short any client, that's the whole point of the post, if I wanted to do that I wouldn't be asking for permission or discussing it online, it's more so to unde

> If you have to ask these rather fundamental questions that any of the current (even free) chat bots could answer then I don’t think you are ready to start that firm. 

But just to be a little bit of a dick. I went ahead and asked ChatGPT for you. Consider yourself consulted:


To launch a successful AI consulting firm, here’s a structured approach addressing your questions:

1. Choose High-Ticket AI Consulting Services

	•	AI Strategy Development: Guide clients in understanding and adopting AI to transform their operations. This service often commands premium rates as it targets C-level executives.
	•	Custom AI Solutions: Build end-to-end AI systems tailored to specific client needs, like predictive modeling, automation, and optimization. Tailored solutions have higher value as they address unique client pain points.
	•	Data Science and Analytics: Offer advanced analytics, including predictive analysis, anomaly detection, and customer insights.
	•	ML and AI Training: Upskill client teams to leverage in-house AI capabilities. This can lead to long-term, high-ticket retainers.
	•	AI Implementation and Maintenance: Ongoing support and monitoring ensure client systems stay optimized, allowing for recurring revenue.

2. How to Get Clients

	•	Networking: Attend industry events, conferences, and online meetups to connect with potential clients. Partner with firms that offer complementary services.
	•	Thought Leadership: Publish insights, whitepapers, and case studies to build credibility. Contribute to AI publications, LinkedIn, and industry blogs.
	•	Referrals and Partnerships: Build relationships with other firms, especially in tech and consulting. Often, larger firms outsource specialized AI work.
	•	Cold Outreach: Identify target clients (mid-to-large firms in sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail) and reach out through email or LinkedIn with personalized value propositions.

3. Billing Structure

	•	Hourly Billing: Common for open-ended projects. Rates for specialized AI consulting can range from $150 to $400+ per hour, depending on the complexity.
	•	Project-Based Billing: Define a project scope and set a fixed price. This model works well for defined deliverables, offering predictability for both you and the client.
	•	Retainer Model: Charge a recurring monthly fee for ongoing support and maintenance. Retainers build long-term client relationships and ensure stable cash flow.
	•	Value-Based Pricing: For high-impact projects, bill based on the estimated value you’re delivering. This can significantly increase profitability but requires experience in scoping client ROI.

4. Compensation for Employees

	•	Base Salary: For skilled AI talent, average annual salaries range from $120k to $200k+ for experienced engineers.
	•	Equity Options: Especially in early stages, offering 0.5–2% equity can attract top talent and foster long-term commitment. It’s also a cost-effective way to compete with larger firms on compensation.
	•	Bonuses: Offer perform

> CGI Federal’s winning bid stretches back to 2007, when it was one of 16 companies to get certified on a $4 billion “indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity” contract for upgrading Medicare and Medicaid’s systems. Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts — GWACs, as they’re affectionately known — allow agencies to issue task orders to pre-vetted companies without going through the full procurement process, but also tend to lock out companies that didn’t get on the bandwagon originally. According to USASpending.gov, CGI Federal got a total of $678 million for various services under the contract — including the $93.7 million Healthcare.gov job, which CGI Federal won over three other companies in late 2011.
It’s also true that CGI Federal began lobbying as it started winning government work. According to OpenSecrets.org, it has spent $800,000 since 2006 lobbying on several different tax and appropriations bills. That’s nothing, though, compared to the many millions of dollars deployed by heavy hitters like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.*

Can’t be an IT contractor without doing a little bit of lobbying. (OpenSecrets)
What exactly were they responsible for?
Story continues below advertisement

According to a June report from the Government Accountability Office, a total of 55 contractors were retained to work on the rollout of the federal health-care marketplace. CGI Federal was the primary one, and had received $88 million out of the $394 million that had been spent at that point (the next biggest recipient got $55 million). Along with building sites for the states that elected to participate in the federal marketplace, it’s in charge of knitting all the pieces together, making Quality Software Services’ data hub work seamlessly with Development Seed’s sleek user interface and Oracle’s identity management software — or “designing an IT solution that is adaptable and modular to accommodate the implementation of additional functional requirements and services,” as CGI Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell put it in a September hearing on the progress of the site.

What exactly went wrong?
That is a matter of some disagreement. And the answer isn’t necessarily that CGI is wholly responsible.
Story continues below advertisement

Some people think that the system was underfunded: Donald Berwick, who administered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011, says the site failed because they didn’t have enough money to build it from the start. Others point fingers at the Department of Health and Human Services, which took years to issue final specifications, preventing CGI from really getting started until this spring.
Either way, it’s clear that the site itself isn’t well constructed: IT professionals told the Wall Street Journal that in addition to specific pieces not working, the whole thing was “built on a sloppy software foundation,” potentially due to the haste with whi

But to answer your question, you should have already agreed upon a model with this client if you term used is ‘billing’ instead of ‘quoting’.
When it’s an hourly rate, I charge my clients the same if it’s prepping for a workshop, leading the workshop, doing technical work or reading through a thread of 10 emails I was forwarded for context.
Other projects it’s for an agree total cost for x services. The ‘risk’ is mine if it takes me longer due to complexity, but so is the upside if I’m really efficient.

If you are leading 10 people across many projects (just like me) you know that you need to understand workload capacity and plan and have things like estimated vs actual time, prioritization, statuses, assigned users, etc and you need it all to flow to billing.  Monday is a little too lightweight. You need more of a PSA (professional services automation) tool vs a lightweight “project management” tool. 

Check g2crowd for PSA tools, and look at leaders in PM tools.  We use Teamwork which is not perfect but works well.

### r/consulting — 2023-04-02 | 19pts

> I can answer this from the perspective of "why I don't run my own consultancy anymore:"

1) The acquisition - delivery paradox: You have to have clients to earn money, and that means dedicating your time and effort to deliver the best service to each client. At the same time, you have to invest time and effort in acquisition, because client contracts eventually end. But maybe the client want to keep you around and has another project for you ... now you have to somehow clone yourself, because you have two clients demanding your time. Or, you bet that the client will extend your contract, and he doesn't, so you're suddenly left with no client, no project and no income until you can acquire the next one. 

2) The middlemen - It's almost impossible for a small consultancy to get a direct contract with a corporation. Most medium-sized and almost all large companies have a "preferred provider" list of suppliers, and are very unwilling to onboard additional suppliers, especially small consultancies. So you end up having to sub-contract under one of the existing suppliers (usually one of the big consultancies or a recruiting agency). That costs you between 15% and 25% off the top. I did this for 5 years (I was a partner in a boutique), and the other company was earning €300 per day for the work I was delivering - €1,500 per week, 46 weeks per year = €69,000 per year for writing an occasional SoW to the client and issuing an invoice every month. (And they managed to fuck those up massively, even though I had recorded my working hours every day in their own SAP CATS time tracking system). 

3) The payment delay - Most clients will try to push out the invoice payments as long as possible. You can ask for net 30, but they'll try to get you to accept net 90. Even if you do manage to get agreement for net 45, it's usually between 60 and 90 days before the money hits your bank account. So, if you do work in April, you issue the invoice on May 2nd, and if you're lucky, you'll have the money in July, but in reality, it'll probably be early August. I used to work for a client who paid its bills after 120 days - their attitude was, "if you don't like it, too bad. If you don't want to wait for your money, then go find another client, because we've got a dozen other consultancies waiting to go to work for us."

&#x200B;

Today, I am in an industry management position - and I understand the situation a bit better. We also have "qualified suppliers" and it's a major pain-in-the-ass to get a new supplier on-boarded. It takes about 4 to 8 weeks for a supplier to be qualified by the sourcing department, then they have to issue a change ticket to get the new supplier added to the ERP system (master data changes are executed by the IT department). The qualification process includes a long questionnaire, credit checks, and (for some critical parts) an on-site vendor audit before the supplier can be qualified. If you aren't certified (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001, etc.), t

> As replied above, the solution should be similar to calling a receptionist and being forwarded to the various departments only that billing is involved. Both the inmates and penpals are registered on the website. Penpals are given a 5-digit code connected to accounts (and therefore their mobile phones).  Inmates call our central number, input the 5-digit code and are forwarded to the person on the other end and are billed per minute (they can load their accounts using various means like stripe).

> This is a trivial setup. One that is easy done with [voip.ms](https://voip.ms)

The cost of voip.ms is incredibly low, and configurability is awesome. There's a reason they are dominant in this field. They charge per use/per minute, but at a rate of like 0.005$ - 0.009$ per minute (half a penny to a penny per minute). There is no "per-extension" cost. It's all shared minutes. So very cost effective. There is no monthly fee, it's just whatever you pre-pay.

The only downside to [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) that it's a self-service system, and customer service is only available through chat -- but they are very knowledgeable and helpful and once you get going, it's not hard at all to understand how things work.

&#x200B;

Below is from what I recall and there are likely subtleties, but overall each of these steps is pretty straightforward to do on the web portal.

If you have problems, you can simply ask the online customer service rep to help you out. If you really need additional technical help, I can probably help (DM me). I can probably get you up and running within 2 hours or so (max 3).

&#x200B;

**Step 1 - Register** a voip.ms account. Note your 6-digit account #, ex: "345678".

&#x200B;

**Step 2 - Finances -> Add funds** to the account (eg: 15$ to start).

&#x200B;

**Step 3 - Transfer your existing office phone number to** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms)**.** (if this will be a new number aka new office, skip this step).  You will have to take a picture of your current carrier's invoice showing your name, address, account number, and phone number, to identify you;  on the same page write, by hand, "please port this number to voip.ms" and then sign. It will take about 10 days for the request to complete.  **Go to DID Numbers -> DID Portability** and follow instructions.

&#x200B;

**Step 4: DID Numbers -> Order DID(s) :** Register 1 new DID (aka: phone number). This will be a temporary number you will use to set up your office while your previous number is being ported over (or this new DID will become your actual number if you didn't have one before).

&#x200B;

**Step 5:  Sub-Accounts -> Create Sub Account.**  Create 5 sub-accounts (1 sub account per co-worker).  These will look like: "345678\_JIM", "345678\_BOB", etc.  When you create these subaccounts.  Assign voice mail number 101 through 105. By default (which is what you want) each sub-account will be assigned the DID you got in step 4, so all outgoing calls made by all co-workers via VOIP will look like they are coming from your office number.

&#x200B;

**Step 6 (optional, but nice): DID Numbers -> Ring Groups -> Create new ring group.** Name this ring group "everyone" -- and in the ring group, select the 5 sub-accounts you just created. This feature will allow everyone to receive a ring if a caller selects an option to speak to  "the first available lawyer". Everybody's phone will ring, the first one to pick up wins the call.

&#x200B;

**Step 7: Record an auto-answer message**. On

> As you can tell by all the responses, there are lots of ways to do this. Smaller firms tend to keep this in house because it allows them to keep control. In bigger firms, this gets much harder because the staffing gets pretty tough.

The first question you need to answer is whether your current set up works. A paralegal doing the calls is expensive. He/she has other skills so they may be able to do other things that make more money.  You could then hire a dedicated intake person to handle the calls. The cost differential would be small because your paralegal (theoretically) could be making you more money. But here’s the rub: you have to hire a great intake person. If the intake person sucks air, it will kill your firm. That’s why lots of firms outsource this. The intake person is a mix of legal knowledge, compassion and sales.  Good ones are invaluable. Bad ones are fatal to the firm. 

In my mind, the best next step would be to document your process with your current paralegal. Figure out what they do. How many calls a day?  How much time does it take per call?  What is the sign up rate (of the cases you want)?  No one is 100%. What are the cases you want? Don’t want?  You need a very very very detailed process so you can then go to market and find someone to do it.  That person could be an in house hire or from a service. Either way, you need to know the process in exquisite detail and be able to track the results. You can’t measure success any other way. 

Once you implement the new hire, you need milestones and metrics to measure success. This is a royal pain in the a$$ because it feels like babysitting. But you have to do it to be sure you’re not getting screwed by the new hire. If you don’t, you will be in 6 months and realize you have no cases coming in because your new person didn’t know he/she was doing it wrong (or was just bad at the job). 

As you can probably tell, I’ve done this. I own a firm and have lived this. Intake is a dark art but very important. Treat it that way and you will do well. Good luck and let us know what you did.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-10-11 | 14pts

> As a new (~1 year) paralegal, who is 55 years old and has three other careers behind me, this is great advice. 

There are ABSOLUTELY some things about being a lawyer (or in the legal profession) that are different from "other" jobs, but the basics of honesty, career development, work-life balance, "good boss/bad boss", etc. are universal. 

1) "Work from home/hybrid/chained to a desk at the office" are UNIVERSAL questions in the workplace. Don't let anyone lie to you about their expectations. 

2) My SAs are amazing in their "support" of me, so I "support" them back with equal passion and zeal. So *together* we've managed to hit some impossible deadlines and sometimes triumph on behalf of our clients. They are as respectful of my abilities and limits as I am of theirs. I wouldn't work for someone (attorney or not) who didn't respect their need to support me. That is the "price" of loyalty. 

3) I have been handed a task and told "go." BUT, along with that, the guidance to figure the shit out, and the acknowledgment that my first draft wouldn't be perfect. The best part of my training is when my SAs answer my questions with "here is where you can look this up" instead of annoyance. It makes me smarter and more capable, and also reflects that THAT is what they want.

4) To quote:

> "I've only been litigating a year and have no idea what I'm doing. It's a whole new area of law for me."

As a newb to the legal field, the biggest shock for me was learning that my SAs (both of whom I consider to be among the smartest, most ethical, and kindest humans I have had the privilege to know)... don't think they know shit. 

They are ALWAYS looking things up, NEVER assuming they "know what they are doing." Both are litigators. Litigation is, by definition, NEVER the same thing twice in a row. My opinion on this matter is worth fuck-all, but you asked the question, so my answer is: if you don't love it being new where you don't know what you're doing, *but can do it with the right support and time and love*, don't litigate. But that is YOUR choice. I f'ing love the fact that my last career will be filled with learning new skills until I'm too mentally weak to learn more. Then I'll die happily. But, that's me. Your mileage may vary.

5) To quote, again:

> (cue panic attack today crying in my office)

I "retired" from being a professional chef to focus on being a paralegal. There's a well-known phrase in the restaurant industry about "crying in the walk-in" which means going into a big-ass refrigerator and closing the door before you let loose on those excess emotions. The reason it's a trope is that... well... e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e has done it, and instead of thinking overwhelming emotions are "toxic", the food service community accepts it is part of life.

It's 10X that in the legal community, but somehow some/most of y'all don't simply accept that. What you do as lawyers is passionate, HARD, taxing, challenging work. And YOU have to accept the responsibility for s

> I saw several other post something similar, and you usually ask the same question.  I use smith.ai to answer my main line, and I only pay $10 a month for them.  They screen sales calls out for free.  Legitimate calls I pay them $10 a call for, with a minimum of $10 a month.  My volume fluctuates significantly, so this deal works out so well for me.

I was once very skeptical of a virtual reception service when I thought they were killing expensive leads for a client.  I put together a quality control where the line forwarded to a cloud service that recorded every call and used ai to both transcribe the call to an email notification and ran sentiment analysis on it, notifying if it detected a call going sideways.  The service forwarded right through to the virtual reception line, so it was like in the middle.  Of course, the act of recording and ai analysis was announced on the line for privacy and eavesdropping concerns, and it was disabled for callers from Illinois because of BIPA.  

I only ran this for like 3 or 4 months before I was satisfied with the service, then I cut it out to reduce cost.  Always an option if you think your VR might suck.  There are a lot of them out there that sell themselves as legal only, or even run by and mostly staffed by recovering attorneys.  Others, like smith.ai, that offer options to use your scheduler, collect payments or run conflicts checks for you.  I think if you are going that route, it is well worth shadowing their work for a bit to make sure you are getting what was promised.

If you want to know how I got smith.ai price down so low, you'll have to DM me.

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> We are a much newer business than those mentioned. We started in April of 2023 and have been growing our capabilities as we grow our customer base. 

Our dedicated agent service is an agent hired directly for you who only answers your calls and can also do other specific tasks that you need. It’s a completely different service. It’s more like a virtual assistant who answers your phones also and you can train on your crm..etc. 

We use the team model now for all of our customers and keep our team sizes small. 

As for our pricing, the more minutes you use the cheaper it is. It’s difficult to setup a new client and train agents on their specifics so if you just need us for backup it is more expensive, but $169 a month is nothing to have a team covering your phones for ~240 hours a month. That’s consistent with all virtual receptionist services.  We don’t just take a message for that entry level pricing. We can give quotes and schedule appointments. 

We are HIPAA compliant and PCI compliant but right now we don’t take credit cards for any existing customers because of the liability. (Maybe in the future)

We don’t have an app like Ruby, but I don’t think that’s worth double the pricing. We are small but we provide excellent service. So would you get a great customer experience with my team? Yes. Would you get an app? No.

> -This comment should be the top one on this question and every other one ever asked about LegalShield. 

The service itself is what i would refer to as a good 'value' if you use it correctly and with the right perspective. Almost all of their plans provide a will/power of attorney document for each member on a plan at no additional cost. so for your $30-$50 bucks you get an attorney discussing and preparing your basic estate plan for you. That alone makes it a good value.

Attorneys generally charge by the hour. So if you have legal concerns that really need an answer, paying $50 for a month's worth of attorneys time is (again) a good value.

It won't fix everything, and won't do everything for you, though.

I think the biggest issue Legalshield/Pre-Paid legal has always dealt with but never really bothered to address is the disconnect in their business model. Being a tiered sales company using outside sales people, they've always had people over-promising the product. There's no incentive or no real check on it since the law firms cannot be directly involved in marketing (ethics) and LS doesn't control the associates directly and harshly enough to control the expectation issue. LegalShield prioritizes catering to their sales associates over their product/the firms, so any concerns about salesmanship are largely ignored. 

If LegalShield ever bothered to actually put the product and the firms first (which would require the sales structure be de-prioritized and forcing it into second position), i think the reputation and value would skyrocket. 

Right now, all of Legalshield's marketing, training, and corporate develop prioritizes getting more sales people into the tiers and securing more associate managers to increase profit potential. That comes at the expense of expectations and market share when the sales model hasn't changed for decades and they refuse to develop an updated strategy to clear the current plateau. They're not going to grow using the same old model, and they're not going to improve their rep by supporting the salesforce over the firms as much as they do.

> Used smith.ai for about two years. They were great, but became more expensive. Plus they charge you per call, which I'm not a fan of. So I switched to answerconnect. Much cheaper since they charge per minute. YMMV since I only use the answering service to get extremely basic information from the client and the calls just don't take very long.

But seriously, learn the basics yourself. There's four hundred or so ranking factors and you can learn them and save that money if you're just starting out. It's not that complicated.  When the money is rolling in you can hire someone to optimize.  Often, people hire agencies and lose a lot of money. 


Start with local service ads, possible AdWords (now google ads) with a heavily optimized landing page (you can learn how to do this yourself) or just copy what's working with other malpractice injury firms focusing on birth law (check the results in major cities in AdWords and don't click on their actual AdWords ads but copy the ad destination address to see their landing page for inspiration).  If you click on their ad they have to pay, so be courteous and just go see the destination address manually inputted into Google. 


I'm a lawyer like you, but I know marketing extremely well. Working on CLEs currently. 


Use negative keywords and focus well on your speciality to get a high quality score. This you could work with specialists on. It's not expensive for them to set up and you can earn a good profit which you can reinvest in SEO with specialists downstream. 


I've also seen YouTube videos that don't take more than a few hours to make rack up thousands of views pertaining to personal injury around birth /medmal so there's that too to augment your efforts. 


Finally, if you need a more sophisticated approach become a topical authority on birth law on your website.  


For example, go to Google, type in your relevant phrases ...and peep the "People also ask" phrases around Birth injury. 


Eg how long do I have to sue etc 


Write answers to these on your website. 
It's free and you'll eventually rank for these queries yourself. 


Then go to Google autocomplete and do this same thing again around the permutations. 


Eg type birth injury lawyers into Google and have a look at what google suggests re autocomplete (eg rates, locations, near me) and use this to build related phrases into your blog. 


While there's over four hundred factors, this approach will give you a user friendly approach that google loves to get started.  Write it for a friend, your mother, a sister or an aunt to make it more personalized. 


Get feedback from your target audience. 


You can then look at things like AnswerThePublic or sites that give you all the queries and more advanced tools like SEMRush. 


This will give you more advanced analysis of how to rank for the words including competitor analysis and more complicated topics like backlink analysis.There are videos which describes this.  


Then there's technical site optimizations. There are a variety of free tools that will show you exactly how to optimize your site and what's missing. You can run the reports yourself and then pay someone for minor fixed, it's not too expensive in most cases when you know what you're doing/looking for and the marketers know you're not an easy target to get ripp

> Hey there,

Well, you've got so many questions here. So, to answer this, I have to charge you... for FREE. :)

I was a former web designer and developer of one of the largest lawyer directories and now going solopreneur.

I prefer to use the term "SEO-friendly" for the SEO "built-in" term.

Let me grab all your concerns here:

1. Does a website need to be "SEO-friendly"?
2. Does an "SEO-friendly" website lead to an SEO contract proposal?
3. How much to spend monthly for SEO to be worked?
4. How much is the monthly cost of a website to run (not including SEO service)?

I will give you simple answers to your questions.

**(1) Yes, you are correct.**

Your website should be user-friendly. But it has nothing to do with an SEO contract. Mostly, modern-design website template has included 'SEO-friendly' as the minimum feature.

So, what makes a website "SEO-friendly"?

1. It has a good structure on the page, such as a page should have a minimum of one (1) HTML tag of H1 and has another H2 and H3 for subtitles.
2. The website should have breadcrumbs.
3. The website should have an XML sitemap to register on GSC.
4. Website load speed should be under 3 seconds.
5. That's all for now.. :)

**(2) No, it isn't.**

SEO service is a separate task from building a website. But, if you hire an SEO service, one of their jobs is to make your website "SEO-friendly" (if it isn't already).

**(3) Normally, you will see the result within 3 - 6 months.**

But here is the caveat. When you see your website rank is good on SERP, doesn't mean all the work is done. You still need to maintain the page. That's why some SEO agencies or freelancers offer monthly contracts. If you don't maintain the page, it could sink into the search engine results.

**(4) There are many parameters to put into consideration to answer this one.**

Where is the website hosted? Do you have a paid third-party plugin (if using WordPress)? Do you have another service integrated into the website? But for normal use, building a website could cost you around $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the complexity. This is just for development, not including the cost of hosting and domain. Some big agencies could charge you way more expensive.

**Simplest solution..?**

Using WaaS (Website as a Service). This is a rare term used in the internet. WaaS is a website builder platform where you can use the built-in template and all that you need is already provided on the template. With WaaS, you will save a lot more money and time.

I recommend you to check this [WaaS for legal website](https://www.tobapro.com/). This is a WaaS specific for legal websites.

They have a free trial for 7 days and you can try it for free. Worth trying.

> Was marketing Google Local Service Ads, 500 per week at first. Getting a $6 return on every dollar spent. I’ve since transitioned my practice to immigration and crim to crim with some civil. Also getting court appointed work so have not been advertising last few months. 

With local service ads for immigration I found it really only worked if I narrowed my categories. If you have ads going into business immigration or asylum, or immigration court. You’re still going to get blasted with all kinds of irrelevant calls. People wanting to answer “quick questions” that are not so quick and rather complex and those questions are deep into immigration world I did not practice in. Business imm not the removal defense I know.

So you’ll need to spend a significant amount of time and money playing with their system to dial it in. Eventually I closed all Ads for anything except for affirmative asylum which was a bit more expensive per lead my ad spend increased $800. That pushed me to finally stop marketing. 

Also pay attention to bad leads and dispute, they’re pretty decent about crediting bad leads. Be careful with confidentiality, the incoming calls are on recorded lines so make sure to answer accordingly or advise PC.

> I graduated from a Tie r 1 and followed the yellow brick road to BigLaw.
Just over a year later got laid off subsequent to the great Lehman massacre.
Spent several years trying to find a way to keep a roof over my head and keep my dogs. I vowed to myself that when I got back on my feet I would never be dependent on an employer again.

Moved to a low COLA city, travelled to some highly compensated foreign language doc reviews to start saving up for rental properties. Also worked for a CPA who worked for HNW families and celebrities so I learned how to do bookkeeping. Gradually got a few properties going which now mean I wake up on the first of the month with the mortgages paid and about $3k to put toward my day by day operating expenses. I.e. they net about $36k/year after debt service and property taxes (yes, I made substantial improvements in each to get them from how I bought them to justifying those rents.)

While scouting for properties I got cold called by a realtor and switched to him. I figured out how to close my own houses and he asked me if I wanted him to refer me clients. I said sure and promptly approached a local lawyer who did real estate and asked him if I brought the clients and gave him 50% of my fees would he cover my malpractice insurance and teach me how to do it. He said sure.

After about 6 months to a year I could do 99% of a deal front to back with my eyes closed and adjusted my split to 90/10. Within two years that realtor, who had cold called me as his very first cold call, became the #1 producing agent in a top 3 brokerage in our region. One of his clients left sales to become a realtor and is now #10. Other realtors saw that I was a lone wolf, completely independent from the political BS and the kickbacks that abound here, and started throwing me deals.

After three years I approached the title company I work with (who I picked because they are the best and the fastest and not because one of the local real estate brokerages is telling me I need to pay them $800 a month  and use their preferred title company to get referrals) and asked them to teach me how to be examining counsel. They did and now I get EC fees on my purchaser deals, and am additionally able to deliver my deals that much faster than other attorneys who use the bigger and slower title companies and don't write their title commitments themselves.

The bookkeeping was my main gig before the real estate took off and I still keep a small group of pet bookkeeping clients (one of them pays 100% of my health insurance so that's taken care of, and the rest nets about $1k a month on top). Being a business management consultant yourself and having a professional level understanding of bookkeeping comes in REAL HANDY when your solo side gig starts taking off and you need to start doing your own escrow accounting for a real estate heavy practice.

If you are organized, do not procrastinate, and can keep track of several moving parts, real estate has an excellent do

> In the very early days, I did the whole "buy a bucket of hours" thing, like 10 hours for $1000, or whatever the pricing was. It's a total pain in the ass.

 - It's not MRR because they only want to buy when they need to refill their bucket of hours
 - You're still working by the hour
 - What about when they don't use all of their hours in one month? Now you're in a roll over situation, could roll over month to month and accumulate. 
- it’s an accounting nightmare to track
- the client never really trust you when you say you use X number of hours for a task

It's just a pain in the ass. I stopped doing that pretty quickly.

The way that I price recurring services is frankly unstructured.

I look at it as a whole, and I usually chunk into things like teams. So as an example, when it comes to the web team, if I add up all of their MRR and then I add up all of their expenses in a month, am I making the profit margin that I want? That's kind of like take number one on pricing.

Next, I confirm that the price that I'm paying is not too low for the marketplace and not too high that it’s going to drive people away, even if I am hitting my profit margins. I really don't want to be making too much money frankly because then I'm just opening myself up for clients to leave for cheaper options in the future.

The final evaluation is the company as a whole, certainly in startup mode, you're not going to have the volume that you will in a couple of years, making it tough at first. I just need to make money every single month, which means I change my pricing as my volume and expenses change. 

I price in totality of the company to be quite honest with you - how is the whole company doing vs. individual services.

I know it's not scientific. I've tried going down to, like, how much do we make per hour and profit per service and person. I've done all that analysis, and frankly, it just doesn't work. I keep it very simple. The natural tendency is to make it complex with tons of data analysis, and let the data decide. Or price way higher than you should and hope for the best in the end. But in the end, it just doesn't matter as long as I'm pricing it properly for the client, pricing it properly for the market, pricing it properly for me, and I make money every month in totality, not at the line item level.

All that said, I don't want to take a hit on any given line item. For example, if you are losing money on something like say a website because you then make money on something else as an add-on like SEO. It's very easy and natural for you to say to yourself, "Well, websites are a loss leader … it’s ok.” That’s a fool's folly. You should never knowingly lose money at any level.

I know I didn’t give you a direct answer. I don’t think there is one. I also think that when people try to make it overly scientific, that’s when they get into trouble. I’m not saying, don’t analyze… You should. But it really comes down to a gut call that someone, you, needs to make.

> yes so firstly ai to lower op/costs but also adding more value to your clients by additional services. as someone mentioned earlier all good making seo/ads/whatever work but if the sales process etc is lacking its an expensive problem to have. 

Maybe the answer is - 'we help you get the RIGHT traffic and interest, then we give you the systems you need to actually close revenue' 

value add for existing customers (growth and retention) + can service different types/new customers. start to position yourselves as more than just seo which is increasingly seen to be commoditized 'why am i paying this when i can get a guy in \_\_\_\_ to do it for $3.50 p/h' 

might be a learning curve for you but you sound pretty capable based on your posts + you could outsource or partner with someone.

> Let me tell you something most agency owners won't admit: 90% of agency acquisitions are garbage. You're buying someone else's problems.

600% growth sounds impressive until you realize what you're actually buying: a bunch of founder-dependent client relationships that will bolt the second the original owner checks out. Those $300-400k EBITDA shops usually have one rainmaker and a revolving door of talent.

At my agency in Armenia, we passed on acquiring three US agencies because they all had the same hidden problem: their profits came from overworking underpaid juniors who were already halfway out the door.

Don't buy an agency because of their service list. Everyone claims to do everything. Buy them for their client RETENTION rate. If clients stay 3+ years, that's gold. If they churn after 18 months, you're buying a treadmill, not an asset.

The smartest acquisition isn't the "complementary service" - it's the agency with a reliable client acquisition system that doesn't depend on the founder's LinkedIn posts.

Ask these questions before buying:

* What's your client churn rate?
* How many clients came from referrals vs. outbound?
* How many employees have been there 3+ years?

The answers tell you if you're buying an actual business or just an expensive hiring problem.

> Thank you. I started my agency in parallel with 2 other guys who also started theirs in the same niche. And we met 2 more guys doing the same thing. Lead gen + appointment setting for Medspas.

Yes I would agree, I went a completely different route than they did right off the bat. They were much more confident in their service delivery (which back then, was based on nothing) and went almost straight away towards growing their client base. 

I do not say what I do not know. Which made it really difficult for me to sell my marketing services, even though I was the only one with professional sales experience. I was only comfortable asking to work for free with an extremely small commission on the backend. 

I knew nothing about the space: not what their services did, the effectiveness of the services compared to others, downtime, COGs, length of treatment, what tier of skilled labor was required, etc. 

I thought Botox was for lips.

My first client was cheap, that’s why she took me on. But I got very lucky. She offered like every service the space has. Over 150 different services.

I mapped every service on an excel sheet and had multiple, multi hour meetings with the owner every Sunday going over every treatment to answer all of the above questions.

In the meantime, I already sold a few moderately high-ticket, very profitable packages for her and she started to trust my judgement. Which allowed me to create an excel calculator with the treatments I found, from talking with her client base over the phone, people would want.

With essentially being allowed to do whatever I wanted, I would call her client list and based on my deduction from the discovery, I’d make a custom package for them in real time and say, “Well Sarah, you’re not going to believe it, the promo we’re running today is EXACTLY what you’ve been looking for”.

This really accelerated my knowledge of, not only the space, but also another business skill I wasn’t aware I was building: creating offers people want to buy. And being able to gauge if this was a good or a bad package based on their reaction over the phone.

Mined you, I was losing money this whole time. Was a week away from homelessness. That triggered me to finally push for “monetization”. It’s really been up ever since. The rock bottom situation was last June.

But the reason why I’m sharing this, is because you’re right. I remember just a few weeks before I hit financial and emotional rock bottom, I was talking with one of the previously mentioned guys.

He was already collecting around $10k/m (rev), which at the time seemed like an insurmountable task. And it was all from service delivery! 

He was telling me about his packages, and me obviously being familiar with the business numbers behind the treatments in those packages, told him that his clients aren’t making any gross profit from his services. Yeah, the revenue numbers look great, but after you take into account COGs AND acquisition costs, the value is literally

> What’s up! I run a very profitable SFC agency. I won’t disclose how much here, but I will say my high ticket offer is $15,000. Now I’ll answer your questions as truthful as can be!! 

1. The pros is THE DEMAND which is freaking massive, and also the PROFIT MARGINS, and the fact this is where the market is shifting. People are now buying products directly from social media apps like TikTok. I’ll put things in perspective for you. When I was making $30K a month running my agency, my costs were only about $2,500 a month so I was brining in about $27,000K in profit BUT I’ll tell you also more truth behind that later on

2. Niches: I believing in Niching down but when you’re first started out, you should work with several different niches because you need to find out #1 Who you can drive results best for and #2 Which niche you actually enjoy working best with and #3 Which niches do have the money to work with you. Example, you may be super good at working with online fitness coaches, but completely suck with finance companies. Even though finance companies may have more budget, if you can t provide results for them, you won’t ever grow your business!! However DO keep industries who make money versus don’t in mind. I love working with clients who have very healthy profit margins

3. Edit videos yourself until you can’t anymore. I used to edit myself up until I was making about $6K consistently. Then I learned how to outsource (which this in itself you’ll have to learn how to do properly) 

So this is the truth about SFC Agency. It’s in high demand, which means a lot of people are starting agencies. Because of that, you’ll need to actually drive results and be good at sales to get clients. But if you can do these 2 things, this space is so lucrative. 

I charge $15,000K for my high end service. With just 2 clients, that’s $30,000K a month.

I also offer a $5,000 offer. 

With 4 clients that’s $20,000K a month 

The math shows with just like 7-8 clients you could be making $1,000,000 a year with about 20% expenses 

I won’t say everyone receives this kind of success, however, I will say if you’re determined, you can

> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Seven federal agencies paid $62 million between March 2021 and November 2022 for various contracts awarded to the consulting firm McKinsey;

Federal ministers and executives from the consulting firm McKinsey must explain themselves to elected officials of the standing committee on government operations and budget forecasts;

In 2021, the Legault government called on the consulting firm to obtain advisory services on post-pandemic economic recovery;
During the first months of the pandemic, McKinsey received $35,000 per day to advise the Quebec government.

--- 

"What justifies an open contract for the next 81 years?" asked Bloc Québécois MP Julie Vignola, expressing surprise that the government cannot hire its own specialists for such a long period.

She then questioned public administration professor Amanda Clarke of Carleton University, who has extensively studied the procurement process in the federal government.

"This idea of ​​having open contracts for 81 years seems outrageous," she replied. "I think that's where we have to ask ourselves what the point of having a civil service is."

The contract available online was awarded on August 31, 2019 and is scheduled to end on January 31, 2100. The form does not specify how much the government is to pay. Instead, it is written that it is a $0 contract for professional IT services.

The government has been in turmoil since the beginning of the year after its contracts with the McKinsey firm made headlines again. The total amount reached $104.6 million for 24 contracts awarded since 2015. The three main opposition parties want to force the government to reveal the entirety of the documents.

According to Professor Clarke, such contracts challenge a principle at the heart of the Statute of Westminster: that of a neutral, merit-based civil service that is able to serve the government regardless of the party in power.

She suggested that the government probably signed such a contract to move faster instead of having to put out a new tender each time. "It's a complicated process," she concluded.
The MP for Beauport–Limoilou tried to find out how much this 81-year contract would cost taxpayers. The senior policy advisor for the Treasury Board, Sean Boots, was cut off by the committee chair before he could answer and will have to send his response in writing.

Transparency issue

The president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union representing 72,000 members, has sounded the alarm. "The government has been relying on expensive outsourcing for years," said its president, Jennifer Carr. "McKinsey is just the most recent example."

She said such outsourcing jeopardizes the security of government computer systems, is less transparent and undermines accountability.

Conservatives have pointed to the consulting firm's ties to the opioid crisis. The firm has also been ordered to pay nearly $600 million to 47 U.S. states for helping pharmaceutical companies

> >Blunt questions about their product

Like what? "Your product is marketed as providing XYZ value and efficiencies to your customers, do you have any data to back that up?"


A lot of times newbies, when trying to be useful, are critical of things thinking that they're helping to uncover problems that have gone under the radar. They haven't learned that the business world is full of bullshit and if something even kind of works the way it was marketed, that's a pretty decent product. I also think newbies frequently get critiqued, so they might implicitly feel that that's how to be useful. Wrong, in the business world shit rolls down hill. Everyone else gets to shit on you (not everyone chooses to) and you'll have to wait your turn until you get some underlings. 

All companies are bullshitting about the flavor of the month buzzwords. Right now it's AI, one point in time it was "Smart <insert object>" . Nike made fucking smart shoes ffs. It doesn't matter if something is actually AI, it doesn't if a device is actually "smart." What matters is that consumers are willing to purchase your products and services and are more or less happy enough to stay a customer. And that's why Nike made a $350 pair of shoes that can tie its own laces from an app.


To answer the last point in your post, consulting firms only win work when they present a proposal that a customer likes. This essentially means that you're going to do whatever the customer wants you to do, not cover all the bases. That would be expensive and a waste of time.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-28 | 14pts | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

> Until you hire a body, get a virtual receptionist like Back Office Betty or Ruby Receptionist. Work with them to develop intake scripts. Manage your clients, matters, and money with Clio and Quickbooks. Hire a professional bookkeeper to get you on the right path and to balance your books once a month. Ours works by transaction ($x/250 transactions). Consider flat rate billing ($x for complaint, summons, svc of process, $y for interlocutory motions, $z for discovery, etc) in stages for your litigation. This saves tracking billing which is just one less thing to worry about.

> Not for me.  I worked harder and made less.  Even more work was not billable, and I couldn’t justifiably bill at my prior firm rate ($100/hr less).  Plus, I had significantly more expenses (office, malpractice insurance, internet, Lexis, billing system, CPA, taxes, Ruby virtual receptionist, LawPay, CLEs and memberships, bar dues, computer and printer/copier systems, website design and hosting, advertising, and a coverage attorney contractor for hearings that conflicted or for assistance when I was swamped).  Plus, I had a wider range of less reliable clients that resulted in a reduced collection rate and more time and effort to be paid fully.  Also, my personal health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance, 401k retirement savings, paid vacation, and other benefits were gone.  It wasn’t easy and resulted in a net about $20k less than I made at the firm and no vacation, which was fine for me until I got married and had a child.  Some years were better and I made more than at the firm, but never more than 10-15% more and always with way more hassle.  #freedom

> To me, a beautiful human receptionist is no doubt the best.  

For automation:   voicemail, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) etc are just an evolution of technologies. So, the next would be AI Receptionist. 

You can experience AI to make your own decision.  e.g you can try [Rosie](http://heyrosie.com/?ref=rddt) AI receptionist service. They offer 7 days free trial. It’s worth seeing what today’s technology is capable of.

The AI agent answers calls like a human using natural language. You can train the agent using your website, FAQ, or database so it understands your business. It is very interesting and affordable to start; the basic functions cost about $49 with no call time limits. Full recording and transcripts will be sent to you by email or sms. Never miss a call. 

For some people, it's hard to believe they are talking/working with AI robot. It's just too new to be accepted. It's similar to many people don't like IVR or those Press 1 for... Press 2 for... system..

> Great breakdown! Your data on the plumbing business saving $4,300/month really resonates with what we've seen in the field.

I've found a few additional patterns worth sharing:

1. Warm transfers are critical - the biggest complaint from users isn't that they're talking to AI, but that they have to repeat themselves when transferred to a human. We built a transcript handoff that solved this.

2. Voice quality matters less than latency. People forgive robotic voices but hate waiting 2-3 seconds for responses. We got ours down to <20ms and saw satisfaction jump 40%.

3. Double-booking is a silent killer in appointment flows. Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).

4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list. We implemented an AI receptionist for a home care provider that automated their 20-minute intake process, saving $200-300k annually. The elderly clients actually preferred it because it never rushed them.

Have you looked at legal intake at all? We're seeing law firms with massive ROI on qualification.

Increase rates as you can justify it and do so regularly.

### Sell More Times
Can you sell more things to people? Simple divorce, sure. Now what about name changes, new power of attorney documents, etc.

## Reducing Costs
There are two main ways to reduce costs:

1. Get clients for less (i.e., reduce CAC)
2. Get results for less (i.e., reduce COS)

### Reducing CAC
The best way to reduce CAC for most firms (especially solo lawyers) is to get better at sales (reducing Sales CAC). As I mentioned before, being more available, taking more calls, doing it faster, and following up more are the keys here.

You spend all this money on getting leads, don’t let them go to waste by not doing everything you can to close them.

Keep increasing this until you:

- Have 16h of coverage minimum. You can always scale it back if you need. But it's not hard when texting is an option.
- Follow up with leads within 5 minutes of them first contacting you. It doesn't have to be you. You can hire and train anyone to do this. Again, it's not hard when you have a single number people can text and anyone can respond to.

**Tip:** Develop a script for closing. You can't give legal advice until they hire you. Someone else can qualify them before you close them. If you need help with this, DM me.

**Reducing Marketing CAC**
There's a ton of ways to do this. It's more of a diagnosis process of figuring out where waste/opportunity exists.

Here's how I think about it in terms of ad spend:

- How much did I spend on paid media?
- How many people saw my ad (Impressions)?
- How many people contacted me (leads)?
- How many people contacted me that were qualified?

With those numbers you can calculate your Cost per Impression, Cost per Lead, and Cost per Qualified Lead.

If one of them is a bottleneck, then you can investigate deeper.

Bunch of people seeing your ad (impressions) but no one's contacting you? Then figure out why.

Are they seeing them but not clicking to your site?

That's probably a targeting problem. Make sure the right people seeing them? e.g., let's say you're doing Google Ads, are you bidding on the right keywords, in the right geographies, at the right times? If so, is the ad copy good or generic?

If people are clicking the ads but not contacting you, then make sure nothing's broken with the page or contact method. Then, make sure your page is convincing? Are you talking like a lawyer or a person? The copy matters more than the design.

Speak to them problem. Make them feel understood. Answer the questions in advance with the page. Don't be lazy, add video. You don’t need high production here. People just want to hire someone who's real and they can relate to.

Making it easy helps too.

> Agreed. I hate clio. In button vLex and FastCase methinks clio can only fuck it up given my terrible experience with clio. 

I’ve posted this on other threads and repost here because the same questions come up. So here’s my experience with Clio for five years and Leap since January 2025.

I’ve used clio for 5 years and become more frustrated with it everyday. I’d had high hopes early on and did deep dives on automation training and everything possible to leverage technology.

But.... Clio document automation is cumbersome and tedious. Tech support gives me contradictory advice from one call to the next. I had to create hundreds of custom fields to track basic data for automation and clio doesn’t let you sort them. Everytime i want to accomplish something easy I'm prompted to buy a subscription app.

Clio is a barely glorified Outlook / Microsoft Business abortion of a piece of Crap software platform.

And clio grow is even worse.

I even paid a consultant $3,000 to help me automate my probate practice. Money wasted.

I signed on with Leap because Wealth Counsel is packaged with Leap for a total price of $200/month per seat. 

I was very wary given my experience with clio.

But...

... I’m continually impressed with Leap. Document automation is so much easier with Leap than it was with Clio.

For various practice areas Leap has pre-programmed tables to ID and connect everybody associated with the matter. For estate planning, for instance, Leap features prompts for you to fill in all family members, all heirs, all devisees, all assets of various types, all executors, all agents,...

Then you click a button and it imports all that data into wealth counsel, where you complete the interview and create the estate plan as you normally would with wealth counsel.

So far, i have not had to create many custom fields in Leap. In clio i would have to have created dozens or hundreds of custom fields by now.

I created a deed template recently for up to four grantors and two properties. Took me about one hour.

You can even create a replicating table that enables you to program one row in a table and it will automatically create unlimited rows. So if you've got 10 heirs you program one row with the data you need to track for each heir. Then you can get the merge field data for each heir imported directly into the document you need to create.

In clio you have no such option to create replicating rows, so I’d have to build a form with a custom field for each separate item. Grantor 1, Grantor 2, Grantor 3... . And then custom fields to describe each person and their ownership interest.

So for a probate Estate in clio i’d have to build out a form with up to 20 heirs, 20 devisees, 20 creditors, with additional custom field sets for each of those 60 items. Overbuild early just in case you someday have an estate with dead heirs and lots of per stirpes fractionated shares.

In Leap i just right click on the prompt for Heir, add as many heirs as i have with contact a

The answering service isn't doing its job, but it seems that if we want the best option, we would have to hire an actual receptionist to take calls, which is too expensive. 

It's whether people would rather talk to a human enough that the benefits of the robot are worth missing out on and the human error from the virtual receptionists are a pill we have to swallow.

  
Thanks very much for your advice on the testing, it's helpful.

> RE: OpenAI o3

The current stage is a proof of concept, but it's a real threat because OpenAI has a pedigree of improving performance at lighting speeds. For instance, the distance between GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini was about 14 months, and in that time they reduced resource utilization by like 14X (going by API costs) while maintaining benchmarks and adding features.

In general terms, think of our current stage of AI as 3 components. The pre-processing, the LLM stage, and the controller or post-processing. In the pre-processing, the system understands the prompt and can doctor it and direct it to various modules to service it. For instance, if you ask a math question, the pre-processor can pull out a calculator so the LLM doesn't have to do math. If you ask a particularly difficult question, the system can pull out Python and write itself an algorithm to solve it beyond what a normal calculator could handle. You usually don't see this stuff, it happens in the background.

The LLM stage (the actual language brain) is what we are saying is fairly close to max ability for now. We already fed the architecture all of the world's knowledge and spent years maximizing optimizations. So the current version of GPT-4o, by my guess, is perhaps \~80% as smart at doing language responses as we are going to get without a significant tech breakthrough... for now as of 2024-early 2025.

The controller or post-processing stage has tons of promise. In addition to using the pre-processor to help digest the prompt and introduce fancy modules to crunch data, the controller can run parallel processes to hack at a problem from multiple angles. We know from various tests that an LLM responds better if it has multiple chances at the same question. I've seen research that shows that a low-smarts LLM can answer as well as a smart one if it is allowed to refine its own answer 100 times in the background.

What the o1 and o3 models are doing is taking advantage of this controller / post-processing approach. They are using their smartest model, and then it tries to improve on its own answers by pursuing various iterations. The underlying LLM is still near some form of GPT-4o, but the result you get comes from multiple versions of itself trying to digest the question from multiple angles and then forming a roundtable of copies of the same robot to analyze everything the robot can do to try to come up with a perfect answer.

OpenAI proved with o3 that if you let the machine eat as many resources as it wants, it gets within range of passing the current AGI tests we have available. This doesn't mean that o3 is AGI, it means that our tests were not expecting the robots to get this smart so fast; and we need new tests that are harder and more precise in what they check for. 

o3 is still missing proper self-learning and memory systems. OpenAI is for sure working on this stuff but it's not ready yet. But systems like o3 (the proof of concept), or o1 (the current smartest robot available

I don’t want my colleagues knowing what I’m billing and I don’t mind doing it. I used to have an office share, sharing a receptionist and conference rooms and having a Mail Drop. I went there twice in one year, so I got rid of that and solely WFH unless I’m in court, which I am every day. I think at this point I’m too cheap to pay someone and if they call my cell phone, I just let it go to VM until I’m ready to answer about ten calls at once. I always did my own calendaring and wouldn’t let anyone touch that. Honestly I love the freedom.

> I didn’t have malpractice insurance for the first couple years and it was fine. (Not required by my state bar although I did have to disclose to clients that I didn’t have it.) Now I have it but haven’t had to use it, knock on wood. 

I don’t use practice management software. I tried MyCase but it was way too expensive and I hated having all my files depend on a third party. So I just use Google Drive and Google Sheets to keep track of everything. 

I have a part time assistant who is in the Philippines and super cheap. She keeps track of my cases on Sheets. Whenever anything is emailed she saves it to the file and updates the status of that client’s case on the Sheet and updates my calendar with what to do next and when. I’m also training her on drafting things for me like EEOC charges and Complaints for my lawsuits etc. I try to rely on her for as much as possible so I don’t have to do as much admin work. 

I need someone to answer the phone (my assistant is asleep during office hours due to the time difference and her spoken English isn’t great compared to her written English) but it hasn’t been an expense I’ve felt like investing in yet because I don’t get THAT many phone calls. Most of my clients text or email so my assistant handles communicating with them about administrative stuff or status that way and then I call them to discuss whatever comes up in their case. She sets up the calls for me and I try to only work part time so she knows my windows of availability. 

Sometimes my husband, who is also my tech/website guy because he’s a software developer by profession, acts as my assistant in terms of calling back clients, meeting them when they want to drop off documents or payments (otherwise I work almost completely remotely which is good because we like to travel and I sometimes have our four kids at home with me when I work etc.) or helping them navigate scanning and sending things to me if they’re older or computer illiterate. 

At some point it would be nice to have an in-person receptionist but I want to hold off on big payroll expenses like that until/unless they’re absolutely necessary.

> Look, I get it, I fought hard to be almost fully remote, but you are way off base in some practice areas.

>Calls can be forwarded to their home office

Yeah, but they can't forward calls to other extensions at the firm, and calls from other extensions can't be forwarded to them. This is a primary function for some support staff.

>mail can be picked up

I said deliveries. There are deliveries from clients and counsel all the time, some of which need to be signed for. Clients also drop things off periodically, and they will take a firm more seriously if they have someone at the desk full time. Fair or not.

>USPS offers informed delivery, so you know when a package arrives

So what, is the remote admin going to drive to the office to safeguard the hard drive of client files sitting outside the door? Things being delivered sometimes need to be processed in a timely manner. An extra day to handle something doesn't sound like much until your calendar is jammed.

>printers cost $300 for home office

Depending on your practice area, you might need a real office printer. Scan to email is much faster when you don't have to reload 50 pages at a time into a $300 POS printer, because the way more expensive/capable office printer is collecting dust in the filing room.

>Maybe you need a part time receptionist, but probably not more.

One of the things you didn't mention is that clients and prospective clients will take you more seriously if you have a full time office presence. These people are usually going through something stressful, and little things like that make them have morre confidence in you as a professional. That is just the reality.

> **Where would you look for businesses that can afford $1,500-$2,500+ per month?** 

Research to find niches where these rates are the norm - especially in a recurring revenue model. With a little digging about avg. marketing budgets by industry, you could likely identify a handful worth researching further. From there, find a grouping of top agencies providing your same services in those industries to find a general idea of what they charge for your same set of services. Also, try and identify those agencies sales proposition. What can you do to differentiate yourself from the crowd? 

**Where would you approach them?**

I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of clients in person. Drop off info at their office and try and get a business card or set up a meeting. Meet them at conferences and do some networking. 

I am sure cold calling and cold emailing can work in some circumstances, but higher paying clients are going to want premium services and will be leery of what might appear to be fly by night companies. Position and brand yourself as a premium service and option. 

Lastly, offer to provide some value add upfront. Business owners and operators tend to be highly competitive people. Offer to do a comparison between their website and marketing vs. their top 3 competitors and bring the results, in person, to discuss in a presentation. Bring contracts and proposals and budget suggestions. Bring a grid of a comparison of your services and pricing vs. competitors in their industry. Bring case studies of your success. Bring referral information. 

  
**What strategies would you use to break through our current plateau?**

Networking. Again, I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of someone in person. Go to conferences, go to local business meetups and groups, go to events where business owners and marketing people are likely to be. Drop off your materials and card at someone's office or building, be nice to the gatekeeper (receptionist, front desk, etc.) and get the name of the best person to contact about marketing.  

Talk to people at conferences and local meetups. Find local business groups that might let you do a presentation on marketing strategies. 

It's significantly easier to introduce yourself to someone, get a meeting with someone, setup a pitch call, etc. in person vs. over email, the phone, or a Zoom call.

> Viable pricing and a lack of feedback loops. 

First, pricing: I spoke about it over in eDiscovery subreddit, but my goodness do these legal tech companies have no clue how to package and price these services yet. 

I've had half a dozen prospective AI clients kill their requests after hearing how billing will work, and all the rules/caveats. 

Per document at $0.90?? What is this, OCR in 1998? 

Install a package for $1,500/month on a 1GB matter???

Locked in for X-number of months minimum?

No trial periods for them to dip their toes in?

Come on... people are anxious, unsure of the viability, and unsure of the $ justification to their client and these AI providers are telling them to kick sand. They WANT to give it a try, but aren't being given the chance. 

Then the other aspect is lack of feedback loops. This is making it harder to use certain software, because there isn't a place to input AND STORE facts about the case that the AI model can continue to leverage in all assessments. There's of course prompt-based workflows where you're supposed to self-contain all of the information in the prompt, but even that has it's limits. Rel aiR for Privilege is doing better in this area, but not perfect.

Give us a separate place where we can simply say "this guy is the CEO" or "That person quit on \_\_\_\_" or "This phone call regarding \_\_\_ happened offline so there's no record of it in the data". Aka: Assumed/known facts that might not be clear from the data itself.

> Since it’s obvious from my username and background, I’ll just be upfront—I’m with ClearlyIP, and we do have a device in this space. Not trying to pitch it, but since there’s a lot of noise around “POTS replacement” and some questionable solutions floating around, I’ll explain what we built and why.

A lot of what’s being pushed on the market right now is either:

* A glorified ATA with 4G fallback (dial tone only, no real SIP intelligence), or
* Devices that rely entirely on cloud registration and fail when the Internet goes out or the provider is unreachable.

What we built is a **VoIP Failover Gateway** that acts as:

* A local SIP registrar: Phones (IP or analog) can dual-register to both your primary PBX and this gateway.
* A SIP trunk endpoint: If the PBX goes down, it can route calls out over its own SIP trunks via built-in 4G (using our private APN).
* A local call manager: During a failover, it can still handle intercom, IVRs, ring groups, etc. So, phones on-site still work with each other and can call out.
* POTS line replacement: Has 6 FXS ports for elevator panels, fire alarms, security lines, etc. with proper support for inbound testing.
* Has 2 FXO ports with a relay that switches those to the first two FXS ports, so you can use them as a last chance all else fails routing of the two FXS lines to external FXO lines in the event you have a power outage.
* Power options: Has battery backup options and pass-through for fire panel power.

It’s not trying to fail over the whole WAN or spoof POTS—it’s focused on **voice continuity** in scenarios where either the PBX or the Internet dies, and it actually handles real SIP call flows instead of just providing tone.

We priced it to be usable too—$40/month including LTE service if you don’t want to buy it outright.

If anyone wants to see a more technical overview (no fluff, mostly demo), this webinar breaks it down pretty well:

Google Voice is tough because their support is very limited. You can try contacting Sinch directly and explaining the situation at one of the numbers listed on their site.

https://sinch.com/help-center/

I would echo the previous comments about a SnapBack. Most carriers don’t like to do it because it’s expensive ($350 per number for our cost as a carrier, $400-500 is what we charge the customer). Your other option would be an expedited port which typically takes 24-72 hours and costs the provider around $125-150.

You should also know that ports don’t happen on the weekend or any major holiday. I would suspect they could get this sorted by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

To be clear there is absolutely no technical reason for the number to be out of service for six weeks for porting. Ever. It usually takes 10-60 minutes for the routing to update when the porting is activated.  It sounds like that’s been done and your carrier just needs to program it in their switch. You can ask them what the FOC (firm order commitment) date is/was and they should be able to provide it. That’s the date agreed upon by the winning and losing carrier that the number will be ported. Most carriers will preprogram the number in their switch prior to the FOC date to allow the service to be provisioned and outbound calling for testing. When the port is activated the only really change is to inbound routing.

Faxing ATA run about $30+ (Grandstream HT801 or HT802)

I would suggest a POE (power over ethernet) switch, you can get them fairly cheap on amazon, if not each phone will need a power supply they run about $15+ each. Some vendors on Amazon sell them with power included. We buy directly from voipsupply and pass on any discounts we get from them to customers. You can also buy the phone from voipsupply they are a good supplier and will help with any defected phones. The POE switch can be placed after modem/router provided by your ISP they are plug and play so no crazy setup or configuring.

You get all the normal features of a PBX, forwarding, transfer, caller ID etc. call recording, voicemail to email with transcribing, FREE CRM integrations if needed.

Optional features:  
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) this is so when people call in they can hear a prerecorded voice asking them to press a button to call an ext, group of exts or a dial by name. We hire professional voice actors avg cost is about $50-80 for the recordings.

Toll-Free numbers -$7  
Texting (SMS to app) - $5  
Texting (SMS to email) - $10  
Texting (SMS to UI) - $10  


All and all this shouldn't cost you more than $60 to $80 per month for an office of that size. even at our "full price", which we never charge, this setup would cost $85 per month. Id be MORE than happy to send you an official quote for our service, if anything you may be able to use it to get a cheaper price from someone else. 

We are VoiceLift a small family owned US VoIP company that's been around since 2005 based out of FL and have customers nation wide :) if you're interested let me know! I didn't know if it ok to put up a link to our site in this post lol

> If it was me I'd try it, good VoIP service is only $2.99/month so that's not a big investment to experiment.

One might guess it would be horrible (VoIP on Starlink) but oddly people seem to be doing it with little complaint.  But keep in mind you are switched to a new satellite approximately once every 4 minutes, so it's actually quite magical that it works at all for longer than a minute or two but oddly people have found it does.

I have 15 phones distributed all over my home and a separate two-story garage a couple of hundred feet away, many of them are programmed with buttons to instantly intercom key locations, it is so convenient and works great!

Whole setup costs $2.99/month recurring and $0.015/Minute for outgoing calls (takes a lot of talking to add up). Initially I used a small form factor PC that someone was throwing in the garbage and just installed FreePBX on it.

Interesting things I've done with it: I once loaned a Wifi connected phone to my next door neighbor for a couple of months (until he moved away), was easy to provision a separate number for his incoming/outgoing calls (extra $1.99/month, so little cost I didn't even bother requiring him to pay it). I still have an extension at an office 30 Kms away from my home via a nailed up VPN connection, super convenient to be able to "intercom" from the office. I also have an IVR so the SO's calls go to sets near her without disturbing me and people can call me without disturbing her. Also having your own 12 channel conference bridge at home is cool!

People think music on hold from home is freaky :) Got to love voice mail to email and of course answering your home phone from the vacation hotel in the Caribbean is also convenient (I just threw a VPN capable telephone set in the suitcase).

No end of providers offer SIP trunking at these sort of very low monthly fees.

Note: Most of my phones are of the good used very cheap variety, a mixture of Grandstream, Yealink, Snom, et. al.

With all the enhanced call handling features and conveniences, all of it costing next to nothing, I can't imagine ever going back to the expensive normal home phone line most people have in their home.

> We have a small 3 person team. We are constantly on the road so primarily need a service that allows all 3 of us to reliably answer phone calls and text messages.  We started using Google Voice and it worked ok when just 2 of us but had lots of problems with dropped call.  We switched to Ooma Business about a year ago and the calls are much more reliable however lots of issues with texting. Texts don't send, we don't always get notifications, can't see texts sent by another team member, etc.  Not to mention the limit on text storage means we're constantly having to do cleanup.  Too much hassle for the cost of $25/user/month.  In short we need the following to reliably occur:

* One number to ring through to 3 mobile phones
* One number to send and receive text messages on 3 mobile phones
* Voicemail 

All of the other features like schedules, ring groups, fax, etc are nice but not must haves.

> I went to law school so I could sue big companies and hold wrongdoers responsible for the injuries they cause. 

I love representing Plaintiffs who are really hurt. Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. 

If...

If only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. 

I had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. 

One quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. 

There are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  

In the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.

But oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. 

Then there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. 

When they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. 

Oddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. 

Your client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every

> You’re asking the wrong questions.

You don't have a collections problem. You have a systems problem. You're treating symptoms instead of fixing the disease.

**Retainers.** Yes, they work. Anyone who says otherwise isn't using them correctly. Get money upfront. Require replenishment before work continues. This isn't complicated.

**Automation.** Your software should be sending reminders, not you. If you're personally chasing invoices, you've already failed. Set it up once. Never think about it again.

**Late fees.** Put them in the engagement letter. Enforce them. Stop apologizing for running a business.

The real answer? Stop doing work for people who haven't paid you. It's that simple. You're a lawyer, not a bank. You don't extend credit.

Every hour you spend “managing collections" is an hour you could spend on work that actually pays. Fix the intake process. The rest solves itself.

> The biggest thing I wish I’d done a year earlier was stop thinking in ''tools'' and start thinking in \*systems\*. Software, websites, and marketing are easy to buy later. What’s hard to retrofit is how work actually flows through your firm.

For family law especially, get very clear on your \*default process\* now: intake - consult - retainer - pleadings - discovery - settlement vs trial - enforcement. If you don’t standardize that early, you’ll end up reinventing the wheel under stress and leaking time on non-billable admin. Build templates, checklists, and timelines for your most common scenarios (custody, support mods, contempt, emergency motions). That’s what gives you leverage as volume grows.

On the business side, start quietly stress-testing your book of business: which referral sources actually convert, who pays on time, and which case types drain energy or cash. Family law will happily consume all your time if you let it, so deciding \*what you won’t take\* is just as important as marketing.

Tech-wise, pick boring, reliable core systems (practice management, billing, document storage) and resist over-customizing early. Where AI actually helps solos isn’t ''magic answers,'' it’s reducing the planning and drafting tax. Tools like AI Lawyer are useful for first-pass drafting, issue checklists, and organizing facts so your billable time goes to strategy and client management, not rewriting the same motions over and over.

Last thing: start acting like an owner before you are one. Track your time even when you don’t have to. Write down your ideal fee structures. Practice having hard money conversations. By the time you open in 2027, you want execution to feel familiar, not like a personality change

If you want to sanity-check one thing first: how many \*ideal\* family law matters per month do you actually want, and what does that require in terms of intake and workflow? That answer should drive almost every prep decision.

> I do free consults but it’s with my paralegal. In order to speak with the attorney, the lowest I charge is $200 and I offer that fee to be applied to the matter. I use to speak to clients for free but then that wouldn’t turn into conversion. Basically, my paralegal/case manger vets the client first and then if it’s a good fit we move on to the next phase to schedule with me. It also weeds out tirekickers because if you cannot afford $200, then you probably aren’t in financial position to hire my firm at this time. 

I’ve found this way to be beneficial because my paralegal cannot answer legal questions. I had one client who refused to talk to the paralegal for the initial and wanted to speak with me (PC was also an attorney). I accepted because it was from a referral partner but to this day, PC wasted my time as PC still has not retained the firm. That’s when I stopped doing the free consults unless PC has been fully vetted from a reliable source.

> At the most basic level, the answer is simple: other firms are already implementing AI, and clients will notice if you’re not.

But the heart of your post seems to be: Why would I use AI when I can have a paralegal bill for the same work and make more money?

The short answer: because when your competitors stop charging two hours for something AI does in minutes, you’ll either start losing clients — or, worse, face serious complaints about your billing practices. And it’s not just a business risk — it’s also a reputational and ethical one. As AI becomes more capable, continuing to bill for tasks that could be automated starts to look like you’re padding hours.

This change is inevitable. Even if your clients aren’t pushing now, they will. There’s a short window where AI is still optional. Soon, it’ll be expected and you’ll be scrambling to catch up when clients start asking why your competition delivers the same result in half the time for less money.

As for upcharging: clients pay for value, not process. If AI lets you deliver better outcomes, faster, with fewer errors — you might justify premium pricing. But you’re not going to get away with charging for what’s clearly been automated busywork for too long.

> If your entire business depends on SEO, then simply don't do it. 

I have worked as a white-label SEO consultant with agencies in USA, and have ranked websites in PI/Car accident niches including locations like Las Vegas, New Orleans where CPC is 100$+, I will answer this based on my actual experience.   
  
SEO would only work if you have other active client accusation channels. Be it referrals, paid ads. I am saying this because SEO is momentum. No body can actually tell whether it will work for you or not till you spend a certain amount of time testing it. 

If you don't have other active channels, this will work as a double ended sword, you might not only loose significant money, you will loose time, which I feel is more valuable. 

First thing is to figure out how much it would cost to run PPC ads, and what is the cost per click in your niche. If this is within your reach, test it out by targeting keywords that are used by people desperately in need for a lawyer. Many times, PPC firms would go after broad terms just to inflate the reports and very little money is spend on keywords that would actually bring in desperate leads. 

Second thing is to find out if your website/landing page is built to convert. I have seen this on several projects where the website looks like a blog, and the service page content is nothing but huge chunk of texts that no body would read. Treat your service area pages as if you are spending 10k per month driving PPC ads to that single page with 50$ a click. This will change your perspective and you will start treating the page from users perspective.

Sadly, there is so much dream selling done in Legal niche by agencies, pushing backlinks as magic bullets to Lawyers just to justify the hefty retainers. 

I have worked with agencies who would hire us for 2k and flip it for 8-10k by adding bunch of articles and backlinks which in reality, won't move the needle.

We have ranked for car accident lawyer terms, competing with big legal firms with massive budgets just based on these 3 things:  
1. You need to reverse engineer what's working for the top 5 results and try to build a better page than them.  
By better page, I simply don't mean more content or backlinks, here I mean engagement. That's possibly the no #1 thing that has helped us achieve results. If people spend more time on your page than the competitors, Google has no other choice but to give you visibility.

2. Focus on user experience and design of your page. The goal is not to drive more traffic, but convert the traffic as well. This is sold by some fancy CRO terms, but in reality its more about common sense. We build wireframes for each page that we optimize and pass that on to the design team. They then build on them. 

3. Build authority for your core service area that can get you maximum business. If you are a PI lawyer and you try to build authority for everything under the scope of PI, you become a generalist. It's impossible for Google to give real e

> What would you do for a $600 case?  File an answer, appear in court, negotiate a settlement by phone/email?  How many hours of work for $600 )e.g 1.0 for answer, 0.2 email negotiation, etc..  Going to court can easily cost 3.5 hrs depending on how close you are to the court.  How many hours dyou put into a $600 case, on average.  When do you jack up the price?  Also, employer plan referral?  What’s that?


In NYS, for example, you can’t use a P.O. Box only, you must have a location that can receive service, like a reception desk.  This drives up cost, but you can find something like that for $100 per month, without actually using the offices onsite- they charge extra for that.  This may not be the case in other states.  

One simple way to stop clients from leaving reviews about not having an office, is simply to include on your business card, or your website “satellite office” and also “by appointment only, various locations depending on client.”  You can always elaborate when you actually talk with them, but put them on notice that you’ll counsel them remotely, or whatever better language you can use.  You can also reply on google by stating the same.  And do it so it makes sense and sounds good to the potential clients who are reading.

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

> I am experiencing something very similar. I have been fruitlessly searching for a decent paying position in Office Administration, so when I was invited via text message to interview with Adam Marshall at K&L Gates I was super pumped. It did seem too good to be true, for instance they asked me what I would require for payment and I said around $23 an hour, with $19 being my lowest that I could accept. He responded that the job pays $30.19 an hour and it is remote! I was thrilled, but still wary. He did a full interview, all on Teams, with 13 questions including 3 references and their contact info, so I may have just screwed 2 people I used to work with along with my best friend by giving the scam artist their phone numbers!! Next he said I needed to wait for a check he was sending by snail mail, then stopped and sent another text message stating that the accounting department just informed him that it would need to be sent to me through my email instead. Very quickly after getting "hired by his superiors", who supposedly reviewed my resume and my answers to the questions asked in the fake interview, I received the email with a check for $2,390.00 to be given to the serviceman who came to hook up my new equipment, including a very fast HP computer. I was over at my mother's house by this time, and we just kept looking at one another like, "What the Hell? Can this be for real? Who sends a two thousand dollar check to someone they have literally never even spoken to on the phone?" Next, I was instructed to capture a screenshot of the mobile deposit and send it for the accounting department's records. I did what he asked, except instead of a screenshot (another red flag, no banking app will allow you to take screenshots of your accounts in any way, shape, or form. DUH.), I used my son's camera to capture JUST the deposit info, none of my account info, thankfully. By this time I was beyond suspicious, and when I sent him the message with the fake deposit, he asked me to check and see if the funds were available yet. Hmmmmm, he works for a multi-million dollar company and he is worried about whether the funds are available? Although my bank did make some of the funds available right  away (only $500 of it, oddly enough), I lied and said they were still pending, at which point he instructed me to report to Teams (and him) at 8am tomorrow morning. All of this was happening after work hours, in fact I just finished the process at about midnight, which made it much more difficult because I cannot call K&L Gates and ask for the Human Resources department, or anyone else for that matter since all businesses are closed! Smart thinking on the scammer's part! The really sick part is he told me to "STAY BLESSED" after I said 'have a good night' to him. We have no money, I am a 50-year-old single mom of 5 trying to finish my degree, and it is impossible to get a job that pays decently AND that I am qualified for.

> As everyone says, bill contemporaneously and bill all those emails as .1s and up.  

Billing is the work, not the outcome. I might need to pull a case file or look up a docket or find the judges opinion to answer an email like “Our motion is due by X date.” It’s a seven word email but it might have taken me 30 min to get there.  Bill 0.5, not 0.1. For this I use “attention to and email correspondence regarding XYZ.”

Billing is not a speed chess clock. I used to feel like I needed to stop my clock any time I put my pencil down. As long as your brain is focused on the task, keep billing. Mulling over how to deal with a bad case while you grab coffee? That’s fine to bill. If you stop to chat with someone, obviously don’t bill that. Also don’t bill if you’re randomly thinking about the case while driving or in the shower - I have seen weirdos on here who say they bill for that.  If you’re legit practicing your oral argument in the bathroom mirror, go ahead and bill for that. 

Finally - others might disagree - but when you’re junior don’t worry TOO much about arbitrary billing limits. Junior people often hear “spend an hour” when they get an assignment. Unless the partner is a total ass, they will be much happier with you if you give them good work product or research and bill 1.5 or 1.9, rather then delivering your half baked westlaw project after exactly one hour. This is also where people eat their own time.  I’ve been doing this for more than 10 years and unless the answer is literally my very first google result, it takes me more than an hour to look shit up. Even if it’s just confirming that the first google result was, in fact, correct.  

If you realize that you’ll need to completely blow your time deadline, just speak up. “Yes I can do that but I think it might require a little longer than X hours.” EVERYTHING takes longer than you think it will. Looking at you, boring as fuck objections and responses to discovery requests. 

Last last, even if you’re slammed, do 15 minutes of research immediately after you get a new assignment.  Partners get pissed off if you ask them extremely basic questions on an assignment they gave you days ago. “Uh what jurisdiction is this in?”

> Finally, THE question I'm qualified to answer! My life has been leading up to this moment. I'm going to drone on a little here...  
  
I left ATC to become a lawyer. I'm obviously a lot older than you; my first day at the academy was in 1982 on the one-year anniversary of the PATCO strike, and I too was a controller in LA, ending up at what used to be LA TRACON on Imperial Highway. I was an excellent controller but frustrated with the culture.  
  
I graduated from a great law school two months after my 40th birthday and found that being a 40-year-old lawyer with no legal experience was not something that anybody was interested in. When I left the FAA, I was married with two preschoolers, and after putting all of us through the ordeal of getting a law degree, to find myself unattractive to employers was crushing. I've now been practicing for 25 years or so and although there was a sweet spot in there where I had enough experience and was young enough to be an attractive hire, I'm now in a position where my LinkedIn profile picture says that I'm too old even though my experience blows away a job description. I'm competing against other people with 25 years of experience who aren't even 50. I want work but I'm having trouble finding it.  
  
Hindsight being 20/20 I would have been better off sticking with ATC until retirement. I would have retired 15 years ago, my FAA retirement would have been higher than my salary as a lawyer is right now (which is the most absurd part of the entire exercise), and honestly, it turns out that I really enjoyed working the ATC problems every day. There are intangibles that still make me glad I left--I'm well respected in the field in which I work, I stopped drinking, and I became 95% less of an asshole than I was back then. But man, it's tough. Although, at your age, getting hired as a prosecutor is more likely than being hired at a firm and you'll want to look at Assistant US Attorney positions to see if your FAA time will go toward your federal retirement from the DOJ. But don't think for a minute that you're going to stop waking up every morning and thinking, "This is unsustainable," just because you stopped being a controller.   
  
Don't sell yourself short in your current career. If you're good at your job and empathetic, you ARE helping people. You've forgotten that what you're doing so effortlessly is quite an amazing thing, and it's OK to bask in that a little. It's impossible to see it from where you sit, but you're making a huge difference in people's lives.  
  
I live in a city with a population of over a million. Although LA County pays much better, the pay range for a city/county prosecutor here is $88K to $118K and the average home price last month was $1.3 million. Be really honest with yourself as you go down this road.

> I'm also in FL and can answer some of these. You probably already know you absolutely must have a separate trust/IOTA account.

Here's how our intake/trust/invoicing goes:

Intake coordinator collects consultation fee and schedules consult call. You may initially do some free consultation calls in order to build the business, but after a while, you'll get better clients by requiring a fixed payment for consultation. No one gets a consult with an attorney in our office without having paid for it before it gets scheduled.

After consult call, prospective client decides to retain. Intake coordinator sends engagement agreement which includes our billing practices, and a payment link for the deposit we require before starting any work.

Client signs engagement letter and pays deposit to trust.

We do the work.

We bill the work, monthly. For hourly work, client must pay the bill, and their original deposit remains in our trust account until (a) an invoice payment is missed, or (b) we've completed the work, if it's a finite thing (prepare operating agreement, quit claim deed, etc), or (c) the client terminates representation. For ongoing general counsel matters, we're holding these deposits continuously unless a payment is missed or client terminates, or for litigation holding it until the litigation is over. If a payment is missed, we apply the trust deposit and transactional work stops until any remaining balance is paid AND the trust deposit is replenished. For litigation, work can't always stop, of course, so the deposit has to be sufficient. This procedure is in our engagement agreement that they sign at the time of paying the deposit.

For fixed fee work (e.g. estate planning), we collect the fees up front in trust, and we apply those trust dollars to the invoice once the work is complete. It's not held continuously like for hourly work.

Expenses like postage, filing fees, are put on firm credit card and paid out of operating, and listed as an expense on the client's invoice for reimbursement.

Paying self is direct deposit from operating, with appropriate tax treatment. We use Gusto for payroll.

> If you're looking at where the money is actually made (or lost), it usually comes down to two specific areas of friction: **Administrative Lag** and **Response Latency.**

# 1. Contract/SOW Generation (Eliminating the "Drafting" Tax)

Most agencies let deals go cold because it takes 48 hours to "get the paperwork together."

* **The ROI:** You can move from a "Discovery Call" to a "Signed SOW" in under 30 minutes.
* **The System:** Use a tool (like Fireflies) to record the call. That transcript is fed into an LLM with your SOW template. It extracts the deliverables, pricing, and timelines discussed and pushes them into a draft in your CRM. Client get one link to sign contract, pay invoice
* **Result:** You aren't "writing" anymore; you're just "approving/correcting." That saves roughly 2–4 hours of high-level management time per lead.
* Ditch the hyped "AI agent" build. Use workflows. You need automations that give you ROI, not burn money on maintenance. Use local hosted tools for 7 USD / month like n8n 

# 2. Omnichannel Speed-to-Lead (The 5-Minute Rule)

Data shows that if you don't respond within 5 minutes, your odds of qualifying a lead drop by **80%**. In 2026, leads are hitting you on IG DMs, WhatsApp, Email, and site bots simultaneously.

* **The ROI:** It’s impossible to staff a human on every channel 24/7. Automating the *initial* triage ensures no lead feels ignored.
* **The System:** Use an aggregator (like Manychat + n8n ) to pipe all channels into one "AI Dispatcher." The bot acknowledges the lead, answers basic FAQs based on your past data, and-most importantly-books the meeting.
* **Result:** You stop losing revenue to competitors who simply picked up the phone faster.
* Make the bot self learn, by providing it human feedback. each day, give it feedback for how it replied. Store these in a vector database. Next days, the bot will reply very close to what you just told it

# 3. High-Value "Intent" Scrapes

Forget bulk scraping. The real ROI is in **Event-Based Marketing.** \* **The System:** Set up a scraper to monitor local news or trade journals for specific triggers (e.g., a mall announcing a new renovation or a major tenant exit).

* **The Pitch:** Your outreach isn't "Hi, we do marketing." It’s "I saw you’re losing your anchor tenant in June; here is how we’ve helped other malls fill that footfall gap."
* **Result:** High-signal outreach that gets a 10x higher response rate than standard cold email.
* You ca read all the news, filter out your ideal ICP, with cheap scrapers from marketplaces like apify

> I’ve seen those offers a lot. “First page or money back” is usually a red flag, not a flex.

Here’s why:

* “First page” means nothing without the keyword. They can rank you for some random long-tail term with 5–10 searches/month and technically “win.”
* No one controls Google. Even good SEOs can’t guarantee positions. Algorithms change, competitors move, SERPs get crowded with ads / maps / AI answers.
* The guarantee creates bad incentives. Most of the time they either:
   * go after junk keywords
   * use sketchy link tactics to spike rankings short-term
   * or define “first page” in a way that protects them, not you

If you’re still considering one of these agencies, this is how I’d vet them.

# Questions they must answer clearly

1. Which exact keywords are included? (With search volume + intent.)
2. What if ads/maps/AI push organic down? (Do they care about clicks or just rank screenshots?)
3. What’s the link strategy? (“We have our own network” = run.)
4. What do I actually get each month? (Tech fixes, content shipped, links earned, etc.)
5. How do you define success? (Leads/revenue > rankings.)
6. Do you have case studies in a similar niche? (Real numbers, not pretty graphs.)
7. Who owns the assets if we stop? (Content, links, accounts should be yours.)

# What a legit SEO pitch usually sounds like

Not “page 1 guaranteed.”

More like:

* “We’ll grow qualified organic traffic and leads.”
* “We’ll target these clusters, publish X pages, fix these issues.”
* “You’ll see early signals in 30–60 days, real results in 3–6 months.”

# About the $900–$1200/mo for 12 months

Not impossible, but usually means:

* very templated work
* heavy outsourcing
* or chasing easy wins that look good on reports, not revenue

If you want, drop one of their proposals here (blur names if needed) + your niche/market, and I’ll tell you what’s legit and what’s BS in about 5 minutes.

> I see a lot of opinionated debate here, so I'm gonna jump in with some hard data, because the numbers actually support both of your stances to some extent.

For reference, we've run cold email for ourselves as well as dozens of clients over the past few years (some industry leading brands). At our peak, we were sending about 100k cold emails/month per client.

It is a canonical FACT that, over the last 5-10 years, cold email has experienced:

1. Increasing saturation
2. Decreasing ROI

We measured our **MSMB (Messages Sent to Meeting Booked)** rate over the past 5 years. The reason we use this as a north star metric is that, if you know your:

1. Sending Costs  
2. Close Rate  
3. LTV

you can easily calculate your overall ROI using your MSMB.

(Side note: Reply rate and open rate are vanity metrics. Anyone flexing a "high reply rate" usually doesn't know what they're talking about, in the same way that a media buyer flexing CPC over ROAS is likely inexperienced).

Over the past 5 years, MSMB has steadily worsened with the following trajectory:

* **2021 and before:** Avg \~50 emails to book 1 meeting.
* **2022:** Avg \~150 emails.
* **Early 2023:** Avg \~300.
* **Late 2023:** Avg \~1,000.
* **Early 2024:** Avg \~3,000.
* **Late 2024 and after:** Range 2,500 - Infinity. (We literally had clients send 25k emails with zero bookings).

So, if your cold outbound system has:

1. The ability to send massive volume for a low cost
2. A large TAM (total addressable market)
3. A completely untapped product-market fit

You can still make it work in 2025. The reality, however, is that fewer than 1/10 businesses have this right now.

We actually had clients profitably spending $50k+/month on Facebook ads who couldn't get a single booked meeting after 25,000+ cold emails.

Given the decreasing trust from sophisticated B2B prospects, we stopped fighting the inbox and started optimizing for Answer Engines/LLMs.

Internally, we call this building a "Semantic Trust Graph."

Basically, the goal is to structure data across high-authority nodes (Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, YouTube, etc) so that when a user asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a vendor, our clients are the cited answer.

And, given how the LLMs are now, you can actually start ranking within just a couple weeks (good for the new guys).

So yeah, cold email isn't 100% useless, but unless you have unicorn-like product-market fit in a totally unsaturated industry, it’s becoming like having a billboard in the desert.

> I had good luck with my 1-man software MVP factory last year - was able to spin up some super impressive MVPs for a ton of clients (from clean tech startups to international peace keeping orgs) using new tech stacks such as TailwindUI, Supabase, Next.js, and APIs in Node.js or Python/FastAPI. 

Having GPT/Phind.com searching documentation for me and helping me to answer (easy!) tasks, especially around backend tasks, kept things fast. Could churn out 1 MVP a month easy, 2 at a deadly push.

Got to $19k MRR pretty quickly, and knowing the budgets in the US for MVPs with this tech stack, was aware it could have got to $100k MRR if I was a little wiser. I had very strong contracts with the clients I built MVPs for - but got completely shafted by 1 partnership agreement in particular that I signed, when I began working as the Fractional CTO for other agencies. 6 months of friendly fire caused me to stop customer acquisition, wind down to just 1 client on retainer, and pause to think.

Fixed price and fixed scope are great - especially when you have a tool to sort it out for you (I built my own tool for this, which works wonders. Basically an automated contract negotiator!) However the other piece needs is to have an efficient, zero-time solution around QA/testing - to validate that your fixed scope work is completed. 

1 unreasonable (generally non-technical, without budget) client that one of your partner agencies lets in - especially if they’re buddies - can run amok with what seems like a reasonable partnership agreement. 

Having end-to-end testing scripts to hand that can confirm - for 99% of users - that the terms of the contract has been met, and the current wishlist is for backlog/maintenancd given the scope of an MVP (keep defining and reiterating this, repeatedly) - is critical. Best to write them yourself - but as a quick extension, would also consider using the service over at octomind.dev for quick AI E2E testing. They’re still very much WIP, but if I pile fuel on the fire in the future, they’ll like be ready at that time!

Or just dictate terms in any partnership agreement upfront. Or just own all of the client relationships yourself, and aggressively refund and terminate any clients that show a slew of red flags.

> It'll try answer both your questions with a model we now use.

Tracking time and trying to achieve a maximum billable rate per head count is where most agencies start. However, soon it becomes a trap for managers. Focusing only at these two metrics (billable hours &amp; utilisation rates) limits the agency to increase its annual revenue. Because if the agency wants to increase its revenue, it has to increase headcount (to have more billable hours to sell to clients) - which is not always sustainable as you may not be able to control the work (i.e., clients may slow down spend etc.).

In the first 7 years of my agency, billable time and utilisation was a focus - we initially targeted 90% and quickly realised that wouldn't work (for reasons you have mentioned). We then targeted 80% per production headcount (6 hours per day) with a view to have 60% utilised across all productions staff on average.  In this model, timesheets was still key and it is important to remember that you can't simply KPI/performance manage staff on achieving 6 billable hours a day if they have no control in selling work to clients. Our Account / Strategy team focused on revenue (sale of hours), and our production team focus on delivery (utilisation and quality). For projects, we created detailed scope documentation (pages and pages of functional spec - which the client rarely read in full), granular estimates for each task, and fixed plans to a deadline date - all of which caused tension each time client wanted to make a minor change.

Fast forward to last year, and we abandoned timesheets altogether. We also stopped tracking billable hours per staff (however, we still track utilisation rates). Now, the engagement is done using sprints (2 week cycle) where we look at the project objectives, features, stories, and do rough point estimation to say "We believe to achieve the project MVP requirement, it will take 6 sprints with 4 resources in each sprint". Clients have flexibility to adjust priorities of scope and we do frequent releases to showcase work (which client love seeing progress every 2 weeks). Our Project Management team use a resource/capacity booking system to track utilisation of staff against projects. This model increased utilisation, motivation and helped the team focus on a single large project. In between big projects, the production team may go to a BAU (business as usual) bench to help with small bits of work for other clients - all of which still uses a 2 week sprint cycles to manage.

From a revenue point of view, our Account / Strategy team focused on maximising utilisation  and we have a revenue target per month/quarter/year. But it also has its revenue limitations - as again, you're selling total headcount capacity in a sprint fashion. Last year we started moving our pricing model towards value based pricing. Rather than charging an hourly rate or per headcount per sprint rate, we analyse what value a project creates for our clients (in collaboration wit

> I get this. I think the doubt is less about your capability and more about how the last 12 months have been set up to eat your confidence alive. You were asked to run without a harness: no training, poor marketing, zero budget, and the expectation that you both deliver and invent a repeatable GTM overnight. That will hollow anyone out.

A few practical things I would do, nothing dramatic, just work you can start today that rebuilds momentum and gives you something concrete to show:

Start with stories. Pick 3 client wins that actually mattered (renewals, cross-sells, a programme you rescued, a C-suite relationship that led to new work). For each: name the situation, what you did (not the team fluff), the measurable result ($$ value, % increase, retention uplift, timeline saved), and one short line about how you made it repeatable or scalable. These become interview answers, LinkedIn posts, and CV bullets, and they force you to see real impact instead of the fog of “I did a lot.”

You say you have always hit target. That’s gold. Turn it into structure: average deal size, sales cycle length, conversion rate from intro to win, number of accounts you reactivated, pipeline you owned at any point. Even rough numbers are useful. Hiring managers for BD roles want patterns not magic.

Build a 30–60–90 for a Head-of-BD role before you get the job. In interviews, present a concrete plan: how you would fix pipeline, what one process you’d change in 30 days, which hires you’d prioritise, a hypothesis for where to find quick early market wins. This shows you are already operating like a leader and not someone desperate to escape fee work.

Use your network like a market test. Tell three trusted clients and peers you are exploring leadership roles and ask two tactical questions: “If you were hiring a Head of BD, what woul you value most?” and “Who in your network should I speak with?” Those answers will both sharpen your pitch and surface warm intros.

Start a short, public signal: a 1–2 page one-pager on a sales play you ran or a client case study you own. Post a thoughtful LinkedIn note on a lesson learned (real and specific). The point is to create evidence you can point to when you feel the imposter voice.

Finally, practice the language of leadership! Move from “I sold this” to “I built the motion that produced X.” Leaders close deals and design repeatable systems. You already have the raw material (delivery credibility + client relationships). Frame it as system design and you stop sounding like a good seller and start sounding like someone who can scale a sales organisation.

IMO, you are closer than you think. The last year chewed up your confidence, but not your skill. If it helps, I touch on this exact transition (from being the rainmaker to building the machine) in [Beyond Slides](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr). Mostly because I saw so many people who could sell but struggled to sell themselves into leadership roles...

> It’s such a mischaracterization. Scapegoats are honestly meaningless especially for public companies.  Do you think the Board gives out a “get out of jail free card” because McKinsey was behind a failed strategy?  They do not - the buck stops with management no matter who they might bring in to advise them. 

And a copy paste from a prior response…

 But to be honest, I strongly believe the majority of consulting work does generate value for clients. Consulting didn't become a $1T global industry by accident. Noting that you're at a boutique, and there is often a very high variability in that long tail, you might want to consider other opportunities that fit better for you.

Here's something I wrote the last time "value" in consulting (specifically MBB) was brought up:

============

Three areas come to mind where we have the most bang for our buck for our clients:

strategy

breaking new ground

organizational change

Strategy - In my opinion, the company's strategic choice - who we are - is the most important decision. When you're big enough, the risk of getting it wrong is astronomical - the cost of consultants pales in comparison. Where consultants bring value is through the an independent perspective of the holistic competitive space today, where it's going, and where the white space is. While the internal people may be talented and knowledgeable about their company, they lack the broader view that a Firm who works across an industry can bring. If I were a Chief Strategy Officer, I'd have the internal team working on a strategy and the consultants creating their own take free from insider influence. Then, bring the two together to blend the best of both worlds.

Breaking new ground - If I were running a business and looking to enter into an area I was not familiar with - whether that be industry or function - a consultancy's perspective would be valuable. They would be able to bring the latest thinking, best practices, and optimized processes that would take us much longer to develop, acquire, or hire on our own. I would not hire us if the new opportunity is a clear adjacency to the core business. To put it in real-world terms, if I were Amazon trying to improve customer engagement via mobile, hiring a consultant would not be on my short list of things to focus on. But if I were Aetna or Sysco, then it could make a lot more sense. Even more so if a company is looking to make moves into new markets or diversified acquisitions.

Organizational change - I'm not using "organizational change" in the way I usually would in this context, but what I'm trying to get at is things like transformation or operational effectiveness that represent a meaningful change for the company. Like strategy, these are typically areas where best practices are helpful and downside risk to the organization is large. The difference is that, as a client, I likely know what the high-level answer is - e.g., cut costs by x%, fix the marketing department, or merge two LOBs.

> >Ultimately, this is a relationship business.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Even if I were just doing implementations, I'd still want to stop in every now and then to show the flag, let them know we're here to help, and hear their concerns.

The rationale I've always been given is 'it's easier to justify billability'. Here's the thing too, I used to believe this exactly before COVID, then COVID demonstrated to me how completely invalid this all was. I've never had an issue billing a client for the same exact initiatives for the same amount of allotted hours whether on-site or not. Not sure if the billing structure is much different in strategy, but at least in most implementations I've done — much of it is already pre-planned, and if directors are somehow not aware of this — then that's just shockingly ignorant of them. 

My issue with this rhetoric is when you have older directors/executives who have rose-tinted glasses on and are out of touch with what actually drives value. I'm not against all travel (I think based on the projects I've done, maybe 1-2 weeks of travel per given implementation \[can take about 3-4 months\] is more than sufficient), but ultimately there are still consulting firms/arms that are still trying to push back to pre-COVID level travels, which is just moronic imho (particularly for something that isn't strategy based).

I genuinely do not see how this helps anyone. You end up burning out your consulting staff on non-value add related work (i.e. travel fatigue — a person is objectively worse cognitively traveling than not, just look up studies of sleeping in foreign environments), and many of them will oftentimes just find another role with less travel. OR, you end up just having your client blow more money on travel expenditures that didn't need to occur. Doesn't matter as much with enterprise accounts, but with lower-budget non-enterprise accounts? I think they'd definitely appreciate not spending 5-10k to fly me and X number of other consultants out just so I can point out to them a flag that needs to be flipped in the config — when the same exact outcome could have been achieved with far less effort or costs over a zoom meeting. 

Maybe this is a critique of my own product knowledge, but if a complex inquiry is asked of me (in which I don't immediately know the answer), it's a lot easier for me to find a solution faster when I can reference notes on a separate monitor instead of taking it away as an action item to be addressed later.

&#x200B;

IMHO, the people here who complain about WFH and reduced travel requirements should really take a step back and actually look at what drives the bottom line/revenue generation of their role and the associated fatigue with everything you do work-related. If something is fatiguing (very broad usage of this term mind you) but doesn't actually produce anything (especially something you can bill against), I think of it as a NVA generally.

> This was run on a digital tv streaming service and generated 9 million customer leads…. So when you say more people look at social media i am not sure what your point is. The point of advertising is lead capturing. Their cost per lead ended up being $.01 per 125 leads. 

Comparing apples to tacos doesn’t make either less of a meal. You won’t get a CPL that low on any social platform ever. The only social media ads i have seen that have generated 1/1000th of the amount of leads cost quite a bit. 

You don’t see good ads on social media because people realized home made = looks like content and gets higher watches and engagement. So running TV level commercials on Social Platforms isn’t always a strategy that performs. When was the last time you saw an advertisement on social and stopped knowing it was a commercial and watched it? If your answer is all the time you should really ask others this to see if you still believe your idea is strong enough to build a business around.

> Thank you, I actually appreciate blunt answers, especially when it comes to work & business!

All of this is super solid insight, makes things much clearer for me.

Here's where I am confused now, was also discussing something similar in another comment thread on here and that person helped quite a bit as well:

I have a very healthy chunk of experience related to filmmaking. Albeit it's a lot of pre-production & production experience but not shy from video editing. For SOME reason, I was thinking I should leave filmmaking aside just as a hobby (because it's mostly for passion purposes), and dive into Digital Marketing from scratch. But after listening to some advice, that wouldn't be smart. I should do something video related. I absolutely do not want to provide on-site/hybrid services because that would mean my physical presence (hence, locally). Relative to a layperson, I am 9/10 in video editing, but when compared to experienced short form editors, I'm probably a 4. But I can learn and speed up my workflow very quickly, as I'm already familiar with the softwares. Only thing that is holding me back is my confusion on what to do and a slow laptop (can always sell some shit).

So the two paths I see could be:  
1. I can either get a \~$110-220/m job as an associate or whatever entry position in an agency & get some marketing experience. Build a portfolio and start my own thing.

2. Or I can polish up my video editing skills and get an $800-1700/m video editing remote job, will miss out on marketing & PPC/CPC ads experience though, but maybe I can figure that out later?   
  
This is where I'm stuck, should I start by providing the video editing services, have a client or two, build their trust, increase my market reputation/referrals/testimonials - and then gradually shift to Paid Video Ad Campaigns? Having learned how to run such ads using online resources/material.

I eventually want to go down the path of Direct Response Ads and similar marketing services that have a clear measurable ROI (in the form of ROAS etc), I reckon it keeps things simple when it comes to revenue growth.

> It's both Industry and Client/Research-specific (the latter drives the profiles that are searched by Research Assistants/Recruiters to identify Candidates).

You receive an eMail/Online Notification regarding interest in your profile (which takes some time to create, includes a typical resume that you likely have, and some summary bullets on areas, solutions and processes you might be an "Expert" (Experienced) with.

Inquiries from the Recruiters are based on information from "Clients" (generally Management Consulting Companies engaged to "Survey Competitors" within certain specific parameters to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market and competitor intelligence that they will create from online research, White Papers, conversation with colleagues on similar Projects and/or Industry Experts identified through companies like GLG.

Overall, I have done two discussion in the 1.5 months I have been a member.  The process of creating and activating the Profile for Recruiters to search on their system was the most time consuming - at perhaps an hour+ with the good fortune of a current resume to upload and some pre-existing summaries I could leverage.

Both discussions were with Consulting Firms engaged in providing an "Overview/Summary/Assessment/Strategy" for specific options/approaches to setting-up types of businesses (one a Risk Holding Entity for Insurance and one a Customer Call Center operation).  Calls were 30-minutes and 1-hour, with the first a one-one-one (with additional off-camera people in the room) discussion that was poorly structures and understood by those doing the research.  The second was better researched and understood by th individual conducting the interview and included specific questions that reflected an understanding of the business and objectives of the approach she was discussing.

The option is an easy way to spend some time and earn extra cash (automatically verified immediately after the timed discussion by GLG with a request to go online, provide your preferred payment set-up by either VISA Gift Card or Direct Deposit to Banking and paid within 1-week of the time spent on th discussion).

Minuses include (as mentioned elsewhere) often times very comprehensive questionnaires that ask VERY detailed questions that include specifics which require an answer and detail.  These are sometimes quite a bit of work and look more like a Survey/Questionnaire in-and-of themselves - and are likely designed by either the Recruiter/Researcher to gather a large amount of detail (often Competitor Solutions, Approaches or known Industry Practices that would give insights as to propensity of use among other companies, types of applications and strategy).  While they do take some considerable time to complete - I find they often do NOT result in any additional questions and are intrusive as a Pre-Screening (likely aimed at getting Freebie Info/Strategy without paying the full amount).

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

> Road warrior here. I’ve been doing this now for a little over 12 years and I actually really love it. I’m lucky enough that I get to choose my own destiny and control most of how and where I travel (but not always). A few things that I do to help keep it interesting - YMMV.   
  
• Early flights only where possible. No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   
  
• Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. 

• Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. 

• Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   
  
• Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    
  
• Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   
  
• Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   
  
• Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   
  
• Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  
  
• Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   
  
• One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   
  
• Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   
  
• Know when to break the routine. If you’re going to a com

> I'm going to first put two pieces of advice I wrote in a different thread, slightly modifie; then address some of your specific questions:

I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. 

Here is what you need to make this work.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps

> Oh!  $10?  Maybe that makes a difference.  I was thinking of what I've read / had to do with the free level of service.

Not to quibble, but you said = google voice told me...    in a chat / call?  Or a web page?  In general I am disappointed in most EVERY business and it's a running joke with my wife - ask a question and get an answer.  Ask someone else at the company and get a different answer.  and rarely, if you ask a 3rd person there, that you get a same answer as a tie breaker.

and you mention google voice isn't offering a permanent number.... not sure of the interface, but you don't want a number they offer you.  You want to port in your number and THAT will be a permanent number.

Down a rabbit hole..... I googled $10 google voice and got told it's called starter:

**A Google Voice $10 price point refers to the Google Voice Starter plan for businesses, which costs $10 per user, per month, but requires a separate** [**Google Workspace**](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1111US1111&cs=0&sca_esv=8e23599b05dcda53&sxsrf=AE3TifP68a2Edmh1KvZGLTSShAIkIk7abw%3A1756135883196&q=Google+Workspace&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5mr_7o6aPAxVkGVkFHQyVCZsQxccNegQIAhAC&mstk=AUtExfDznIP8V4VA6cTlBrF_B8bIQ0MHsf-bfqCdsPnXZUz5jnGlmwSZyZJSFJGekL0ot-2Sh6XENXEP4N3KKYey74Tgzk0HGidG6KgEJAXZhh2shPJKznQRK3h8YBy8W_dSwmwvnnYEgTjAmJWh5iju4Xc8YuAfYzVUMKddkQ8qHBQsN38Di82460ixmaDKJRdKAk-olwTZtfEXjNpOb-FFz4NEBcDKDisSP7q26HrPxgTk46Yhj-mmBNYbDkjJ6nbrVBlBJ3K41SWSC-adF6wm3yQkkQTpWfN6HdVMppzIGuUlRw&csui=3) **subscription, starting at $6-$7 per month, to be used.** 

Googling google voice starter plan port in, I get:

**You cannot port a number into the Starter plan for Google Voice. Number porting is only available for Google Voice for Business plans, which require a Google Workspace account, not the individual, free, or paid plans of personal Google Voice. You will need to set up a business account to port a number into Google Voice.** 

So that's wrong at least on this:....  number porting IS available on the personal / individual plans.

And starter?  There's a personal version (you are on?) and business?

That's googling / AI answers about a GOOGLE service.  

I get soooo frustrated at the inability to get accurate answers from companies.   perfect example here - you will likely get more accurate info from someone (seems like it won't be from me... sorry!) here rather than google's own pages.

### r/agency — 2024-07-09 | 2pts

> First of all - good for you have decided you want to get involved into business / making your own money.  Being freelance myself for 6+ years, 2 of them running my own agency I can give you these tips from the bottom of my heart:

1 - don't chase status, which you are by asking a the question "what" agency you should start. I'm not accusing you, but it comes off as you wanting to get "the answer" of what service to start. Now image your car breaks down and you call a mechanic. But this mechanic is doing this only for two weeks and don't get your car running, just because someone told him being a mechanic is "the best way to be self-employed". 

Now, the point I'm trying to make here is that running an agency sounds cool, but is it? Rather than focusing on the status, focus on yourself and your skills. Nowadays you can make money with everything, literally. What skills do you have or have the interest to learn? What "problem" do you want to solve or what kinda people do you want to have an impact on? Don't wanna work with people? Maybe a service based model isn't for you, maybe it is, only you could know. 

Go step by step, it's like a game. Don't ask what Porsche you should buy if you haven't earned your first $1 yet. Don't ask about the agency, ask about your skills, your interests and what you could do all day without even getting paid. 

2 - plan maximum only 12 weeks, not 10 years. You have no clue what's waiting for you on the other side. It always never plays out the way your think / plan and that's okay, it's called live. Ride the wave, enjoy every minute of it and focus on your craft. 

3 - talk to a lot of people. Be interested in different business models, entrepreneurs, "agency owners" (not Iman Ghadzi videos) and ask about their service, experiences and upcoming. The phase you're in is the very very first step, act like it. You don't need to make 100k, you don't need automations or fancy systems / software / coaching. Stay away from shiny objects and try being okay with you having no clue what you're doing. Don't put a time on it, it's about the lifestyle with all the goods (status, money, accomplishments) and the bad (confusion, clueless, loneliness, disappointment etc.) 

You're gonna find your thing, wish you all the best :-)

> "If you're not making the firm money then why would they continue to employ you."

For the same reason that the firm employs folks like the receptionist, the Intake Specialist, the Office Services Clerks, the Records Manager, the IT Manager, and the Biller.

None of those folks can bill their time to clients for what they do.  But, what they do SAVES the firm more money than it costs to pay them.

Firing a paralegal - especially a paralegal who has expertise in an Admin function like Billing, or IT, or Records management, or Risk Management - is wasteful, and could expose the firm to wrongful termination claims in the future.

The much more cost-efficient strategy is to re-train or cross-train paralegals who are failing to meet billable requirements into doing some of the cost-saving functions that the firm needs just as much as time-billers as profit centers.

Using what you have - instead of wasting money to recruit, hire, train and retain new talent - is one of the principles of Strategic Management.  Since you didn't mention it, that indicates that you went straight to law school from undergrad.

> Could not agree more, don't mix messages. Focus more on the PI website and immediately start working with a company to help you optimize SEO.  It will take you a long time to see results but you'll quickly learn how much more profitable a direct in case is versus a referred in case.  

There are a lot of charlatans in the SEO space it's taking us years to find a reputable company, and even they aren't perfect.

Unless you have an unlimited trust fund, you'll never be able to compete with the big marketers in your area. There are probably multiple firms with eight figure marketing budgets.  You have to figure out where they've left gaps in their coverage and paint those corners.  Make sure your personal network knows what you do.   Your style is your style, but there are ways to remind your Facebook friends what you do (posting about a hearing or interesting details about a specific case, check in at your state bureau of investigation when you take a medical examiners's deposition) without coming across as an ambulance chaser.   

Figure out how AI can help you .  I'm no expert, but it's amazing how much time the upgraded ChatGPT account has saved me.   By no means is it perfect and be careful for legal research, but proofreading briefs and stylistic improvements can be amazing.  Upload your motion and the defendants responses, provide other helpful details like depositions, and let GPT brainstorm creative arguments or pour out inconsistencies in the defendants briefing, etc. Just make sure to check everything before you cite.  Spend time creating good prompts and you can easily summarize depositions or create timelines etc.

Try to share Office space with other personal injury firms if possible. It's amazing how many successful strategies we've developed were ideas of other attorneys shared during an encounter in the hallway 

If you don't already, get an assistant or paralegal ASAP. Both for optics (who wants a lawyer who answers their own phone) and because your time is much more valuable generating business or closing out your cases than licking stamps and sending letters .  

Finally, get a good bookkeeper ASAP. Don't waste your time doing quick book entries unless you have significant bookkeeping/accounting experience. Trust accounts are no joke and you can get in big Doodoo if you mess that up, even innocently.

Enjoy!   I started with no cases and an $800 HP computer attached to a dropbox account – now we have a 20 person Firm and handle 7 to 9 figure cases.   I say that not to brag but as context for this statement: the most enjoyable years in my career were the first 3 to 5 of the firm when we were building the Firm and trying to figure it out.   Of all the recoveries over the years, the most memorable was that first million dollar settlement, which felt like proof of concept for us.    It's a ton of fun!

> I think you didn't quite catch what I wrote. Time keeping is already integrated into the CLM. In Clio, I select my client and then push the "send email" button. It will automatically create a billable entry. I have document automation integrated into Clio... I select my client and then select the "Draft Petition" button and it will automatically draft a petition and create a billable entry.

I don't see how paying for an entirely separate system will help at all. What time will I save? The billable entry is already recorded on the client's invoice.

For billable entries that are manually recorded and take place outside of clio, I am very skeptical that you can do what you claim you can do in an efficient manner. If I'm researching case law on LexisAdvance, how will you know what client it's for? How will you account for interruptions and phone calls, and when my boss walks into my office?

There is a reason attorneys record their time throughout the day as they work on things. Trying to remember what you did for every 6 minute increment throughout the entire workday is literally impossible.

I wouldn't even trust myself to approve the AI generated summary. What if it misses something for one client, and bills it to the wrong client? I honestly probably won't even catch the mistake even with your AI generated summary. I will only know I made the mistake when some angry client calls my office to complain he is getting billed for work that was completed for other clients. How embarrassing that would be...

Honestly, is this even solving a problem that I have? I don't think so. The more I think about this... This doesn't even seem like a solution at all. This is not even a solution searching for a problem. This seems like a software that will create even more work for me and should be avoided at all costs.

> I used Ruby when they first launched years ago. Wasn’t a huge call center then and there were assigned receptionists (team) to our account. 90% of the time we got one of the team receptionists…during higher caller volume or overflow it was someone else but no issues. Sold that business and don’t know if they continued with them or not. But used them for a couple years. 

Switched to a local provider for current business. Prices for Ruby have gone up, sure. It wasn’t 24/7/365 coverage back then nor did we need that. We don’t have that now from the current local provider, either. But you expect people to pay $3.50 a minute for overage on a starter or entry level plan? Or $2.25 on a basic plan? Your pricing of your packages is completely inconsistent. Where did you go to business school? Also where is your HIPAA compliance policy? PCI compliance policy? I would absolutely pay Ruby MORE for peace of mind and not worrying about the inherent liability. Are you receptionists bilingual?

Your site also mentions a dedicated personal receptionist “coming soon” and suggests we sign up and pay now to get on the waiting list. So it’s like Ruby used to except they did a small team? I’d consider paying your prices if the person(s) were dedicated.

We pay less now than your rates and have dedicated person(s) and don’t have any compliance concerns. If you offer a demo or trial I’d give you a shot as I have no idea what your backend looks like. I hope the client portal isn’t designed like your Wordpress site. Also hope it’s not an off the shelf solution that will have integration issues. 

Not trying to crap on your company…just was pointing out your pricing is grandiose. But I guess it makes sense if you putting yourself in the same league as Ruby, Abby, Smith AI, Nexa etc.. Correct me if I’m wrong, but are you on that level? If so, congrats.

> PI cases take a while to settle. It's unfortunately not as simple as sending a bunch of demand letters and waiting for the money to come in. 

- You can get a settlement offer from an insurance company, but most of the time it'll be too low. It won't cover the medical bills, especially once your fee gets taken out. So the only way to get the offer to go up so it's reasonable (ie an offer the client will accept that'll cover the meds) is to file. Once you're filing, the litigation is a time-consuming waste of time. Most litigated cases get settled without going to trial, but you'll still end up doing discovery on a lot of PI cases. Tons of ATIs. PI litigation is very formulaic, the interrogatories are always the same (describe the accident, client's injuries etc) but managing litigation deadlines in a PI firm with a lot of cases is hard. The law isn't hard, but there's an art to doing PI well and it takes time. 

- Support staff is absolutely CRITICAL in PI. The best PI lawyers are the ones that have good support staff. Staff make or break a firm in any field, but esp in PI. A lot of lawyers don't really work on PI cases, it's the staff doing all the work. You don't just need staff that answer phones, you need staff that are super resilient and will stick around despite clients yelling at them 24/7 cuz they want their money immediately.

**Pros of PI:**

- No billables

- Easy to find car crash cases in a major city

- Can make decent money 

- Don't have to hound clients to get them to make a payment

- Unless the client was in PT for 6 months+, these cases don't have much paperwork. You're not dealing with 50 exhibits and 2000 pages that often. Most records & bills can be sent/uploaded electronically, which is easier to deal with.

- Don't have to go to trial that often

- Basically zero legal research or motions. If you hated Lexis/Westlaw & case briefing, PI doesn't do any of that

**Cons of PI:**

- **The clients are the WORST.** Aside from family law, PI clients are the most insufferable. They're insanely demanding and will call your office every day demanding updates every hour, and they're completely ungrateful. PI clients think *you* owe *them*, when in reality clients wouldn't get a penny from insurance without us. Clients always think PI cases will get resolved in 1 week, when they actually can take 1-2 years. They think their lawyer will just send a scary letter and insurance will give them $1m. Seriously, PI clients are awful. Pay your staff well, cuz having to deal with some of the worst clients imaginable all day is a really hard job. PI firms can burn through staff quickly cuz the clients are so demanding, and nothing's ever good enough for them. Even when we literally work for free and then give them money. 

- **PI's really redundant.** The cases are all really similar, if you're looking for excitement and variety this isn't the field for you. Sometimes you can get a big case with some serious injuries, but those are like 5% of y

> Hi! So, I graduated from law school in 2021. Ten days after graduation, my wife passed away. As you can imagine, my post-graduation employment wasn't going to work. I knocked out the bar while handling my wife's affairs and hung out a shingle in my hometown so I could help my in-laws, etc. 

Since then, it's been pretty good. I average about $2-4k/week depending on what I'm focusing on. Problem is that I spend about 10-20 hours/week drumming up more work to get into the pipeline. If you're willing to take the odd one-off projects -- such as reviewing a commercial lease for a small business for $500 -- between more complex litigation and business clients, then it's definitely workable.  
  
One note: there are incidental costs that you don't think about at first. Ooma for my office phone costs like $50/month. My domain, email service, and website are about another $100/month. Then there's your portion of the FICA taxes, whether or not you're an S-Corp. You pay for your own insurance. You get the idea.   
  
And there's always the dreaded accounts receivable issue -- some people don't like to pay their bills. One law firm I did contract work for still owes me $10,000 that I'll have to sue for most likely. That'll be a pain. 

Finally, there are emotional costs I didn't expect. It's hard to hear the schizophrenic people leave voicemails; you can hear how much they are suffering with their delusions. People struggling through addiction will cry when you tell them that their criminal charge can't be expunged/sealed. You'll never do enough pro bono work to stem the tide of need out there, but you'll feel like you can and should do more anyway.   

With that said, I feel like there's a limit on what you can do yourself without working for other attorneys. I've been feeling like an unevenly sharpened knife lately. Because I am in charge of what work I get, I naturally gravitate toward my strengths which leaves my weaknesses to atrophy further. I just finished revising my resume and plan on putting out feelers to see what's out there. My hope is that a stint with a law firm could help me polish myself into something more refined and effective. 

I hope this helps. =)

> I concur with your conclusion. I am a retired CPA, currently serving on one local board on a volunteer basis. The invitation to serve on a board and receive compensation seemed like an opportunity worth discussing, so I scheduled a call today at 3:00 pm EDT. 

This morning I received 2 separate emails, reminding me of my 1:00 pm phone appointment. So, I concluded that they shifted me from 3 pm to 1 pm. Unprofessional, but ok. 

I was prepared to receive their phone call at 1:00 pm, as their email stated. NO CALL!

So, at 3:30, I noticed that I had a voicemail from this company at 3 pm. The caller referred to his call for our “prearranged” call at 3 pm, as if to suggest that I failed to honor my appointment time. 

I called him then, and he apologized for the confusion…He proceeded to run me through the pitch, including the eye opening compensation and limited time required to earn these board fees. 

I informed him that I truly possess the credentials that I mentioned, however I was curious how this company is able to do the necessary background check on these candidates. How do they know I’m representing my background honestly? 

His answer was weak, referring to various social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook. 

I was waiting for the sales pitch- and sure enough it surfaced. $195 up front, month to month contract. I knew it was a scam. 

I asked him who pays the insurance premiums for board of directors liability coverage. He had no idea what I was talking about.

I explained what this coverage is, and he said, “well I guess that’s on us”…!

I politely ended the call- and decided to see if this company had been covered on Reddit. 

Thanks for sharing- I hope other possible victims are able to read these comments and avoid the financial drain. 

It sounded too good to be true. And it is!

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

> Thank you so much for sharing this info and it is really cool that your post has received so much attention.  

It sounds like you have a solid system that is by far working well.  I think you shouldn't mess with it too much.  Often making small changes to nudge a metric can make something else tank.  You have an advantage tracking so many metrics that you'll probably catch that fast, though.  I just think that the gain for the effort is probably low return unless you are for sure scaling up next year.

FWIW I pay $10 a month for my north american 24/7/365 virtual receptionist.  If I get more than 1 call a month, they charge me $10 a call.  I mostly get sales calls, but they don't charge me for gatekeeping those.  They're a solid service as well.  If I wanted to, I could have them walk somebody through the intake form, book an appointment on my Calendly, or even run a conflict check through my Clio contacts.  They would charge for it, and I don't have them do that, but it is nice to know they have the capability should I need it one day.

I've worked with a lot of solo and small firms and the ones consistently successful at bringing in new business that were not referrals had an on-staff intake person.  Some do it with VR and others with an IVR setup similar to yours.  I've yet to come across a firm with a non-attorney running their initial intake that averages less than 14 new matters a month.

  
IANAL.  I am legaltech.

But I’ve been doing this for 20 years and I don’t have to cover for the receptionist in a pinch anymore. And I “bill”all my admin time and get paid for it. 

That structure makes zero sense for a law clerk. You should be paid hourly, period. If they thought you weren’t billing enough time for what they pay they needed to talk to you about how to increase billable time, not steal your non-billable time. If you’re billing 8 hours a day that means you’re working more than 8 hours a day and they’re stealing your overtime, too.  You work for shitty people.

> Agreed, it should never be this way. I ran a firm for years before switching to back-office support services. The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for "the benefit of the firm's KPIs."

It needs to be simple:

- Incoming call
- Answer
- Name
- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. 
- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. 
- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. 

The firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. 

If your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.

> Technically no, but there are so many ways case management software processes help you for the future. 

1. CYA: I document everything - every call, every action, everything in the case management software. When I need a certificate of conference on a motion to compel I can filter the notes in the file and pull any tagged "Defense counsel" and grab the dates to list how many times I conferred with defense on the issue. I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. 

2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. 

3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from "service" to "litigation" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. 

4. Expansion: You're a new solo, but if you want to bring on staff or other attorneys in the future, having a CMS prevents things like accidentally deleting a line in the excel sheet, usually gives essentially version control to most stuff in the file, and allows you to set standard processes that let you train staff, make sure they're doing their work, assign tasks and grow responsibly. But in order to do that, it's so much easier to set up the processes before you have them and it's just you. build a foundation with an eye towards expansion so you're not trying to create processes and adjust to the new CMS when you've got two paralegals and a receptionist.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps a bit thankless, work. Check out appellate public defense work. I might be doing that if I wasn't doing this and had no loans. Last contract

You were involved with litigation, right? Perhaps there’s some opposing firms you liked working with and could see yourself moving to. Chat them up and see if there’s opportunities for you. This isn’t the only game in town. Even if things aren’t bad, you still progressed from receptionist to paralegal and your skill set has grown. It’s perfectly normal for folks to find a new job to continue growing their career a year or so after a promotion.

-Regarding the device security, I’d suggest to them they need to give you a device owned by the firm. 

Also, don’t install any MDM stuff because they will erase everything on your laptop/phone if and when they fold the firm or you leave- regardless of whether it’s your or their device. Also, you probably don’t want to have the liability of keeping your device secure “enough”.

> TL;DR: You can go solo and there are TONS of ways to do so! 

  
Meh. It depends. You can work up to an easy solo "Ronin" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  

You can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do "DSS Defense" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).

The worst part (for me) is the "running a business" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a "brick and mortar" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that "Gen-X Joke" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  


The #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  


14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)

From what I've researched, the tech has gotten pretty solid especially the ones that can actually qualify leads and integrate directly with your practice management system. We've been testing out getserva.ai since they're doing a 30-day free trial right now, and honestly it's been handling our intake calls way better than I expected for just $149/month.

> This question was secretly and silently deleted years ago by some mod for some unexplained reason shortly after I posted it. 

Purely to make the original question viewable, I've pasted the original text below. 

I am no longer looking for answers to my questions. No response is needed if you happen to stumble upon this post in 2023 or later.

----

I've actually installed asterisk on my work box, edited a dial plan, sent commands to a ATA, etc* so maybe I'm not a total n00b, but I'm at a loss on where to go to get started.

Currently: I have two prepaid cellphones. One with a number that I've had for 10+ years, so I want to keep it. I cut the copper landline years ago, and probably I can't go back. (Because...) I have FiOS at home (...and I doubt they would want to hook up the copper again). I have several boxes at home and would not be adverse to making up a new box running linux or BSD to run 24/7 as my answering machine/ forwarding box/ etc.

I want to ease in to this because I'm currently job hunting. The truth is that these prepaid phones kinda suck. Sometimes I don't get  my voice mail notification promptly. I do pay less than $12/month for the prepaid plan though. I don't make a lot of calls, but I do need to be accessible.

My rough plan of action would go something like this:

1. Get VoIP service from a provider and a new local phone number.

2. Build a box to run at home 24/7 to store phone messages, custom dial plans (ex-girlfriend and others), and manage a desktop VoIP phone that plugs in via ethernet (which I have not purchased yet). Probably no analog POTS phones at all unless it is a super cheap option vs getting a digital desk phone off ebay.

3. Forward my new phone number so it rings my two cell phones and my desk phone at work (during certain hours) at the same time, and takes messages if I don't answer (emails me an mp3 of the message, etc..)

4. Port my 10 year cell number over to my VoIP provider once everything is stable and to my liking.

5. (optional) Buy a used Android phone off ebay, flash firmware if needed, and use it without a cell plan for calls over wi-fi to my home asterisk box.

I saw a message a few weeks ago that offered advice for picking a provider, but what I'm really lacking is the VoIP lingo I need to intelligently evaluate what a provider can do for me.  **So (tl;dr) step 1 is probably "What do I need to look for with a VoIP provider in relationship with what I want to do as outlined above?"**

*(this was actually done to simulate a user picking up a phone, dialing numbers, etc. It allowed me to write scripts to do automated regression testing on work's souper seekret phone related box. So I'm perhaps not a total n00b but have zero experience with some aspects of routing SIP calls over the net, providers, etc.)

> The problem here is the quality of the result. 

For example, last week I was asked to bid on a legal project that wanted to run a Gemma 3 12B model locally for estate planning. This is a very low-powered model from a sophistication standpoint. It can, however be run on a consumer-grade GPU, if you have patience, as tokens per second is the equivalent of watching turtles have a race. 

Legaltech has some fairly sophisticated asks, so I ran some tests on this specific local model vs. the full foundational model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) across a series of related legal prompts. Pro had 100% faster responses vs. hosted Gemma 3 12B, but more critically, offered vastly superior and more accurate answers to this small model. **This should be the number one reason that you stay far away from small self-hosted models.** 

Now you can host a large model locally, or a medium model using a service such as Groq, but for the former, you are looking at $100,000+ for a single server.

> Real talk: The traditional "find a mentor" approach rarely works. Here's what actually works:



\*\*1. Reverse mentorship\*\*



Instead of asking "will you mentor me?", lead with value:

\- Share insights from your recent experiments

\- Introduce them to potential clients/partners

\- Contribute to their content/projects



I've built stronger relationships by helping experienced folks with things they don't have time for (research, testing tools, community management) than by directly asking for mentorship.



\*\*2. Specific, not general\*\*



Don't ask: "Can you mentor me?"

Ask: "I'm struggling with pricing my productized service. You mentioned charging $X for similar work - what metrics did you use to land on that number?"



People love answering specific questions. It's the vague "pick your brain" requests that get ignored.



\*\*3. Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn threads\*\*



Honestly, you're doing it right now. Posting questions, getting feedback from multiple experienced people > one formal mentor. I've learned more from:

\- r/agency discussions

\- Indie Hackers threads

\- Product Hunt comment sections

\- LinkedIn posts with real numbers



...than from any formal mentorship.



\*\*4. Build in public\*\*



Share your journey publicly. When I started posting about what I was building and the problems I faced, experienced founders reached out to me offering advice. The mentorship found me.



\*\*5. Paid communities/masterminds\*\*



Sometimes it's worth paying $50-500/month to join communities where successful agency owners hang out. The ROI from one good insight > the membership cost.



\*\*Reality check:\*\*



Most "mentors" are just people who figured things out slightly before you did. They're not wizards. Read their content, apply their frameworks, ask specific questions when stuck. That's 90% of what formal mentorship would give you anyway.



The best mentor is launching, failing, iterating, and sharing what you learn.

> Without working the typical 9-5…. We work mostly all hours or all days. The lies you see on YouTube are not how real people actually run agencies. 

AI = this isn’t going to be a viable service for a long time.  If it was easy to fine tune and get working flawlessly all agencies would be doing it. We are using AI for some highly rudimentary tasks in an app we are building that has been profoundly useful but complex AI usage is still a long ways out (depending on the task).

Finding Customers = this is literally the hardest part for every business type. It is the business part. You don’t have a business unless you have exchanged money for something that is not money. It is the single failure point of most businesses at most ages new and old. This is actually hard and it should be. I would argue that it can be the easiest part of an agency after your first 10-15 clients… but you have to get them and REALLY make them feel like they under pay you with results. 

SAAS = i think your questions around this make it hard to answer in a useful way. No good SAAS is going to be fast to build. The easiest way to test a business is this. Tell me who your target customer is in less than 10 seconds…. Tell me what major problem of theirs you are solving in less than 10 seconds…. If you repeat that to a potential customer can you show them in sub 90 seconds something really high value… if these are easy you likely have an actually good product if you start solving large scale financial problems. 

I own an agency with 15 employees, 10 years in business, 2 SAAS products created as a result. We created a Wordpress hosting company (because we have a LOT of people we do hosting for). This solves a problem for us… we are a large customer and it saves us money. It also allows us to direct people who are not ready for our services to a good place to host their site and reach out with questions. The second SAAS is an alternative to Mailchimp, Klayvio, etc… this took 2.5 years and was a $1m yrr business the day we launched it. 

The above is how most agencies progress over the years you find customer, fix problems, niche down to charge people in areas you are most beneficial with your experience and then make software to sell to the general public and stand it up on your agency. I have 6 friends who had 8 figure exits from agencies and this same story would explain 100% of them. Hopefully something in here is of use to someone :) cheers 🍻

> You may have answered your question. If you see most SERPs coming from Clutch and co then it makes sense to at least try to pay their fees. Clutch is $125 / month so if it brings you a single client that pays >$750 after 6 months it's worth it. Seems like a reasonable bet to make at least as a test.

FWIW I don't think that monthly fee is the real cost - you need to commit to succeed on any of these platforms. Offer services for free or cheap, collect plenty of good testimonials and ratings, etc. That takes time and effort way beyond what you pay the platform.

> The niche doesn't need to be high ticket.  The level of output your agency performs just needs to align with the niche.

Example:
We're a $500k agency with packages at $750/mo for SEO and Google Ads.

We serve all landscaping and lawn care clients.

A competitor of mine ONLY serves landscaping and lawn care clients over $1m in revenue and has minimum monthly packages of $10k that includes about $5k in adspend. 

He doesn't serve my market because I have lots of clients between the $100k and $1m mark as well as clients over $1m and even $10m.

However, my solution is a lotnless comprehensive than his. We do less work and thus charge less money to tap the undeserved market.

Regarding picking a niche, it doesn't necessarily need to be something you enjoy but you do have to learn to enjoy it.

My partner gave the example that you could be into video games and at your dentist you and your dentist start talking about video games. The conversation could lead to you talking about your agency youre starting and using him as a test client. Suddenly you get into the dentist niche.

I also suggest looking at the market cap of that niche. If it's a small market cap you're going to hit market saturation faster.

You also need to consider how much your potential client will make off of one customer. Then take how many customers you think you can help deliver to the client and divide it by your costs. Are they still profitable on a per client basis?

If the answer is no, then either you need to adjust your pricing, strategy, or that niche can't support what you're offering.

If you consider scuba, consider that all of your clients are likely going to be on the coasts.

Do you also offer services to competitors? If not you could hit saturation pretty quick.

Mixing skydiving would be good a good option as you have all of the inland space to avoid total saturation.

So if you do scuba and skydiving... your niche is really "Excursions"

And that opens you up to other things like white water rafting companies, zip line companies, and so much more.

But I would recommend just sticking with the two until you build up a solid base of those clients.

> See how you just asked a question?

I can now answer it. After I answer it, every single person that enters the post and reads the comments will see my answer. 

Sometimes, months from now, some one will face the same problem as me, the OP, and search about growing an agency too fast on Google. 

Then everyone that sees the post in Google, will now see this comment. 

So all I did was take some time to answer your question and now I've built evergreen content that, if detailed enough, will now generate interest in my services and build the perception that I am an expert at what I do. 

Then, some people will read this comment, and say "wow, this guy really knows his stuff." Then they'll go to my profile and start reading my posts and my other comments. 

Then they DM me and say, "hey I really liked what you wrote about X and I have Y problem. Can we set up a time to see if you'd be a good fit to take on this project?"

While everyone is acting like they're too fucking important to help other people--It's all I do. People think helping others is low ROI. These people don't understand how people buy AT ALL. 

I don't even purposely intend to generate prospects and it just happens naturally. I was so active on Reddit at one point, I was generating 3 calls per day as a freelancer.

I wrote this comment once about the Google Ads algorithm and how bandit testing prevents accurate A/B testing because bandit testing combines the exploration and exploitation phases of the experimentation process.

I made $90,000 in attributable revenue from that single comment in consultation fees alone--not even retainers.

> Wide spread cheating in the graduate program application process, by people buying and selling leaked case studies and question banks

  
Only 2 years into my uni degree and considering applying to work for the big four, there are already numerous scandals, from WireCard scandal (auditor is EY) and the tax leak scandal by PwC (CEO just stepped down).

  
People wonder why these scandals seems unstoppable. I think the lack in integration started all the way from the beginning, tracing back to the graduate program application, when the consultants and auditors cheated through the application process when they, when the consultants and auditors first started with their career.

  
If anyone looks online, you see numerous cheating practice and popular service providers for the graduate application program, from applicants buying confidential online test question banks (sold for \~$300), to social influencers selling leaked case studies interview questions in real time with suggested answers (sold for $200), referrals sold for $3600 (oh god they are rich) and even business providing services to just do the online tests on behalf of the applicants.

  
Remember, these applicants are the future consultants working at the big four! And these online influencers often claim many people got in with their assistance.

  
And this is not even a secret. If you do a quick search, you see many influencers with thousands of followers. If you don’t cheat, you are put at a disadvantage. This is exactly what is happening with the PwC tax scandal isn’t it? The culture to cheat, to stay competitive?  
I sincerely hope someone would take action on these unfair application process. I have written to the big four but they seem to be too busy to take a closer look. I get it. They are not police. But would ethical companies not at least try to do what they can to make sure the graduate program application process is fair? As an applicant myself, I feel extremely unfair and frustrated but nothing much I can do.

  
I have collected some of the screenshots my friend shared with me as evidence. Happy to share if someone knows where to best report these people (example attached but I have more to share)

### r/LawFirm — 2025-01-11 | 2pts | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> I just got done launching my solo PI firm this first week of 2025! Thank you for this list, I definitely referenced it a few times. I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:

1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my "finalist" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer "office" over "firm".

2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my "finalist" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, "first.lastinjurylawoffice.com" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. 

3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. 

4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. "Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert." If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. 

5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. 

6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free

7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) 

8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. 

9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. 

10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. 

11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. 

12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.

### r/agency — 2025-11-12 | 4pts

> There isn’t a straightforward answer to this as it depends on lots of factors, I’ve seen lots of agencies do incredibly well from focusing on single services or industries. I’d say it definitely makes it easier when you’re starting out as it’s much easier to create a compelling proposition for a single sector than for the mass market, and / or much easier to manage resourcing for a single service line than for 5. It might depend on what your longer term aspirations are for the agency, the niche you have in mind and also on where you’re based. If you want to build a $15M revenue agency in the UK market, you’d struggle to do that just targeting pest control companies for example as the market isn’t big enough. You could probably build a nice 15 person agency doing just pest control in the UK that made you decent money and gave you a fairly easy life though. Specialising in a larger sector (retail, travel, financial services, B2B) in the UK market would give you scope to grow a big agency while still having a niche. US market is much bigger so I’m sure you could build a big agency just focused on pest control, and a huge agency if focused on a bigger sector. It’s still possible to build a successful agency without a niche, but having a niche when you’re starting out definitely makes it easier.

We had certain specialisms that we focused on as an agency and those specialisms changed and evolved over close to 20 years as the agency grew, but we never fully niched down to a single sector or service. We actually started out with a very narrow focus (multilingual PPC) but that quickly expanded as we evolved and took advantage of opportunities that popped up. For example, we were only doing multilingual PPC but then clients were asking if we could also do multilingual SEO so we launched that. At one point we were doing a lot of multilingual work for retail clients and won some high profile accounts, which then attracted other retail clients that didn’t need multilingual work so we started doing English-only work too. We then wanted to set up in the US and initially intended to focus on retail as we had great creds in the UK, but found it really hard to gain traction without US retail client case studies - so we pivoted back to focusing just on multilingual campaigns in the US and grew very quickly as a result. Most of the multilingual work we won in the US was with B2B clients, which then meant that we could target other B2B clients that didn’t require multilingual work…

We never fully niched-down to any particular service or industry and managed to grow to 150+ people, but definitely benefited from focusing on particular sectors or services at different times as we evolved. Starting out with a more narrow focus and then building out made it lot easier than if we’d started as a full service agency targeting all sectors.

> 1/2

First things first you have to ask yourself - why would someone buy a website from you? When they ask what you do that’s better, what are you gonna say? When they ask about SEO and ranking better and what you do for that, what are you gonna say? What problems are you solving for them? What is wrong with their current site, why is it wrong, how do you fix it, and why are you uniquely able to fix it? Sales is the first Hurdle for most developers. It’s not easy. It’s a whole other way of thinking and now you have to talk to people, be personable, knowledgeable, and navigate the conversation skillfully to close the sale. It’s not about the website or their old one looking bad. It’s about what problems you solve. People buy solutions. And if you don’t have any, you won’t sell very much. So you need to work on that. What is your unique selling point, what do you do better than anyone else, and what problems you are solving for them and why it’s a problem. And if all you’re doing is slinging cheap crappy Wordpress themes then you are no better than Raj in Pakistan charging $200 on fiver. You can’t compete and you won’t solve any problems, which means you won’t get referrals or repeat business because your websites just sit there like their old ones did. It looks better. But they have no traffic and no conversions. Why? If you can’t answer that question then you aren’t ready to start.

Also Focus on how to use flexbox and grid, transforms, transitions, mobile first coding, positioning, differences between display block and Inline block, etc. very important to have the basics mastered.

I HIGHLY recommend finding a good designer to work with. You can find good ones for $20 an hour in Asia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. They’re amazing out there. My guy in Bangladesh is the core of my design team. I gave him a raise to $25 an hour. And once we keep growing I’m bumping that up too and taking care of them nicely. Design is hard. I try to do it myself sometimes, but it’s always just easier having someone better at it than you so you can focus on the things you do better and are more productive at. You’ll be glad you did.

Then there’s pricing!

I have two packages:

I have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance

or $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc.

$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself.

Lump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.

Nice, simple pricing. Simple projects. No databases. No booking features. No payment processing. Wanna know why? Because you don’t have to build everything yourself. There’s so many third party services out there that do niche specific booking services and perfected it for you. Just have your client set up a few demos with some companies and find the one that works best for them, their company rep will help

> I gave you honest feedback and you shouldn't get defensive like that, because you know that I'm right.

How many times did you see a professional working with Fortune 500, copy-paste some screenshots from Stripe/Facebook Ads?

I'm going to tell you how many times: ZERO.

No case studies and no testimonials. Just a bunch of logos to "look legit" to a really gullible – and probably young – audience.

A picture that was taken with the camera of a cellphone with bad lighting.

No footer with a legal entity, an address, a privacy policy... nothing.

Not a single section explains what you do, how you do it, or why you are different.

A website that looks super sketchy with some cropped screenshots slapped on it – you can literally take a free theme from WordPress/Ghost/Whatever and it would look 2.000 times better. You can pay a guy on Fiverr 30 $ and they will give you something legit to use. No need to be a Senior Graphic Designer.

Last but not least, it's not about being on Reddit; there are thousands of multi-millionaires wasting time here. Even in this sub you can find some really successful people that interact with others just to help them out – or because they want to wind down with some light activity – like me right now.

But you are literally sending messages to kids that want to start their "SMMA" so you can pitch them your services – I checked your post history before.

Do you think this is what an expert of that caliber does? Because if the answer is yes, then I'm JESUS CHRIST!

At least don't treat people like idiots – by calling them negative when they point to you the obvious discrepancies between what you say and who you truly are.

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck with everything!

Take care,

> Yo....  So...

How does ICE know where people work?   Because It's on their I-9 form.   When ICE shows up to an address with a list of names?   Those people are hired on a I-551, I-776, or I-94 form.  They pass E-Verify, and are documented legal employees.   Who under executive order are being subject to extrajudicial revokation of legal status and removed from the United States, or detained, or shipped to El Salvador.   Lots of options there.

The key word here is documented with legal status.  That's why ICE knows where they live and work.  Because the have legal documents.

The undocumented / illeagals are a totally different story.   That being said if you want to wash dishes, dig ditches, work in a slaughter house or do agricultural labor, there's not enough illeagals to fill those jobs and they will take you.  I've met some of the owners.  They take anyone with a pulse same day, and can never find enough people.

Back to subject at hand.  

This is R/consulting.  So if you can't talk the talk why would anyone take you seriously.  

Lovely troll comments.

But when I file a change order or contract claim for $2,000,000 of labor costs due to a site shut down from an ICE Raid on on of my projects that cost us a 2 day delay and a million dollars a day of labor?  And now we have further delays and ICE related litigation. Between Owner, Prime Contractor, 3 dozen subcontractors, internal and external legal counsel, not to mention a dozen consulting firms on different sides of the problem?

Like just sorting out that mess is a full time job for like 6 people for at least a year.  Been there, actually have the t-shirt.   Which is another million dollars or more in service labor costs.

Then say legal action - jeez, now the lawyers cost another million on each side just to explain to the executives and shareholders there's nothing they can do other than accept it, pay for it and move on.

So end result is several million dollars of extra cost in ICE disruption remediation.  Not to mention the weeks of overtime, missed family time, closed door arguments, and meetings.

All because ICE showed up in Masks and Guns, and decided to Revoke the working Visas of a security Gaurd and a Junior electrician that were I-551 or I-776  legal immigrants with Federal Employement Authorisation.   And the wrong tatoos.

So legal counsel is basically telling me the best strategy to deal with ICE is basically to hide them, keep them quiet, and give them whatever they ask for as quickly and quietly as possible, as to save the millions of dollars of problems that happen when masked guys with guns roll up on the security gate.

Seriously.  According to ICE statistics Last year over 200,000 immigrants were peacefully and quietly removed from the United States with Due Process and NOBODY CARED.  The news media didn't care, none of us knew it was happening or didn't worry about it.

Like 2 dudes in suits show up with badges and a warrant; we have a 5 minute chat, call in the p

> I decided to respond because my life was changed by doing precisely this. It isn't for everyone, but my desired lifestyle needs autonomy, and it is impossible to get that in a big company, especially as you are climbing the ladder.

1. 8 years ago, I dropped my normal job with vesting in retirement and stock and even gave up my health insurance to start a small consulting firm in an unrelated field.  Consulting on your own puts a much larger portion of your hourly in your pocket, and having a firm puts a portion of your employees' hourly in your pocket, but you are responsible for getting the gigs...

2. 50% of our clients are organic word-of-mouth which took considerable time to build, the other 50% resulting from marketing/direct outreach.  It is industry dependant, but our industry involves highly regulated or otherwise public governmental processes, so our client pool is easy to get data for.

3. Branding is different for an organization than an individual, being a thought leader is important for both.  I like to think of our firm as a brain trust in our field, and i have rounded out our staff around this goal.  I never wanted to be a sole proprietor - you can only crank your hourly so high... and you have to do actual work for every dime you make.  To me, it's better than working at a firm in terms of autonomy but it has a hard cap on revenue.

4. Clients have all sorts of different needs. Our projects are varied, but we typically treat each new project type as a 1-1, and if it can be turned into a repeatable or automatable and marketable process, we make an SOP and if possible convert it to a fixed price deal

5. I never started solo, but with a partner and one employee.  We staffed up pretty quick - as having additional revenue streams for the business makes everything easier and you can eventually afford support staff for admin.  We have had success doing some "lower level" consulting in adjacent areas, preformed by lower paid staff.  It's allowed us to take on more types of projects.

6. Colaboration with other consultants is great, either through a direct collaboration, a pass-through, or just a referral (fee). Just write a good agreement. Around year 4, I noticed that we were referring a lot of the same type of work out to third parties on a regular basis, so I brought in-house any of the services we could reasonably provide, and monetized the referrals going forward.  

Partnerships can be great - and also awful.  Have a good agreement - but that is only 10% of it.  It's a relationship not unlike a marriage.  I have a great situation with now two partners, but we have clearly delineated roles and responsibilities with no overlap and complete autonomy.  They are good humans, we've established extensive rules for governance and decision making, and we have SOP's for every process... and it still gets really shitty sometimes.

7. Make long-term life goals before you make career goals. YMMV.  You have to do some real soul searching.  For

> This is a post I published in my newsletter that hopefully will inspire a few.

👇

You cannot really learn the consulting business in school. 

In the real world, the process is more like serving back-to-back apprenticeships, under a rogues’ gallery of masters. 

It happens in the office, in open spaces and in conference rooms. It happens in airports and hotels. It happens after too many coffees and it happens with one too many drinks.

You move to New York, Milan, London, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Singapore. True story.

You network. 

You befriend analysts just like you, slaving away putting PowerPoints together at ungodly hours. 
And you buddy up to the Senior Managers, and the Directors, and the Partners with their names always listed first on proposals. You put in face time, work for peanuts, take on grunt work nobody else wants.

You teach yourself.

You tackle projects working from 7am to 10pm, Monday to Sunday for 55 days in a row, with half of your team members speaking a language you can’t understand. You vow you will be leading engagements your way before you turn 30. 

Day One as an analyst, some fast-talking senior consultant asks if you validated the KPIs to set a success baseline.
“Validated what?”

You teach yourself.

You take a training course. Then 10 more. You get PMP certified. Then TOGAF, then something else. Maybe you literally go back to school and study your way to an MBA. Eventually, you’re glad you didn’t. 

You pore over old decks and books on strategy and frameworks. You read manuals on how to write and how to think. You learn how to speak - I mean, you know how to speak but can you persuade and influence?

Partners and managers give you harsh feedback tearing apart all slides you submit. You’re thrown in the sh*t, dismissed as useless and exploited as cannon fodder. 

Your bosses take your time, drain your mental stamina, run you ragged. You let them. 

You let them, because you know that is the price to pay to grow.

You get forwarded an email with no context. The instructions are simple: “Can you get it done?”

You teach yourself.

And you get it done.

Your consulting buddies become your network. One gets hired somewhere else in a bigger role and pulls the whole group up. You are that one.

Your boss calls, asking you to finalize a response to an RFP for a big client. By tomorrow. “Can you make it?” Of course you can.

You teach yourself. 

Alone at your laptop, struggling to answer the fundamental consulting question: “How the f*ck does this sh*t come together?”

Creative epiphanies and breakthroughs come slowly after banging your head for hours when that intricate set of Excel formulas finally stop giving #REF! errors. 

Each baby step forward matters when you tally small wins into big results.

Over months, years, and decades, the pieces come together into a puzzle so complex you have no idea how you managed to solve it (or, did you actually solve it?). 

You can point to a governance framework you built for a pres

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-15 | 1pts

> So, I kind of do a hybrid. California family law. I’ve been on my own for about 2.5 years and was at a firm before that. 

I will say that I do zero advertising. I am currently (knock on wood) 100% word of mouth referrals. Back when I was at a firm, we did paid advertising and 100% paid consults. While I didn’t handle the intake calls (we had an office manager for that) I do know that we charged $475 for a 1 hour consult and that a lot of the potential clients from the paid services dropped off when they heard about the cost. Great! Fine. They probably wouldn’t pay anyway. 

Now I usually only do paid consults when I *don’t* know the potential client is coming from a good source. I know the source because, before I speak with anyone ever, I have them fill out an online intake form. The intake form isn’t just for conflict checks but also asks about salary, property and who referred them. If the potential new client refuses to fill it out, fine but we’re not talking unless and until they do. 

That said, I work with a number of entertainment lawyers, real estate lawyers, business managers and the like. Let’s say I did a divorce for Actor A two years ago and Actor A’s entertainment law attorney, John Smith, passed along my contact information to Actor B, who the entertainment lawyer also represents. I might see that Actor B wrote on their intake form that John Smith referred them. I’ll do that call for free because, almost invariably, I’m the only divorce attorney this person wants to bother contacting. Assuming I seem normal on the phone, 9/10 times, they’ll hire me by the end of the call. 

If I don’t know the referral source, I’ll take a look at what the potential client wants and what their resources look like based on answers to the intake questions. In the US, you can very easily look up addresses and home values on Redfin. If they live in a $7M single family home and they want a prenup, I probably won’t charge for a consult, because it’s probably a good case and the call is unlikely to take too much time. They probably just want to talk to someone professional and nice and check that box and be done with it. If I can’t read into the information on the intake form AND I don’t know the referral source, I’ll likely charge. 

All that said, I think those online referral things are absolute shit. You’re probably better off networking with other lawyers and advertising in a hyper local way. Other lawyers are a terrific resource because 1) when people need a family law attorney, they’re likely to ask for a referral from the only lawyer(s) they know and 2) if someone can afford the first lawyer, they can probably afford the second. Try meeting with trusts and estates lawyer, real estate lawyers and small business type lawyers. Get to know them so you’re the first person they’ll recommend when someone calls them and asks for a divorce referral. Secondly, hyper specific local advertising is probably the way I’d go if I did advertising. There’s an eleme

> My only answer is a lot of time. DV cases aside, family law is generally an area of law where everyone sucks fairly equally just in different ways. You’ll get a client. Hear their side. Feel awful for them and become emotionally invested. Then you’ll get to know them better when the other side sends screenshots of your clients text messages, or youll find out your client hid that she had a vacation home in a family trust.  They all lie to varying extents and most of them are trying to pull one over on the other or try to get their atty to make the other’s life miserable. In the midst of that, you get paid $$$$.

Your job is to provide a legal service. That’s it. You aren’t there to save anyone from themselves or fix anyone’s life. That’s what therapy is for. Family court is also generally the Wild West. All you can do is tell the court what happened and hope they rule in your favor. There’s very little law to argue and you can’t control what the court does. You are there to argue on behalf of your client and to know what to ask for. Set boundaries on that. When you start getting stressed. Stop what you’re doing and take a minute to remember that boundary. Reset your nervous system. Make good habits like this in the beginning and it will help. Also if your client is super emotional or thinks you can fix everything, recommend that they take that part up with their therapist.

> There are some good answers here. I'll weigh in on the pricing of websites and SEO. There are two schools of thought. And typically, if you are paying for a monthly fee, you are still better off than a one-time set it and forget it with the website. The hosting, support, security, etc that comes with monthly is worth it - and you can get SEO bundled in. 

There are a few companies out there that can get real results for around $1k/month - possibly a little higher, but not much. The thing to understand here is they need to be doing actual work - what are the deliverables? The reason so many firms are burned about SEO is that it's easy to say you are "doing work" but not actually doing anything as many attorneys don't know or don't have the time to keep up with it. Companies I'm aware of in these price ranges that we've dealt with include: PaperStreet, Civille, MeanPug. These do have expanded services like link building, etc that are going to exceed the pricepoint above, but if that $1,000-$1,500/mo range is where you want to or need to live, results within 6 months with these real deliverables are possible (within reason). 

If you want to go all-out, while paying a lot more for services, I'd always recommend rankings io. Although, they do charge quite a bit more and largely work with PI firms. But they do a lot and have a pretty good track record. 

But yes, the $2500 and $199 after seems to be a race to the bottom kind of company - and you are going to get what you pay for there.

### r/LawFirm — 2024-03-14 | 3pts

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu

### r/VOIP — 2025-06-11 | 1pts | Mentions: **Vonage**

> Sorry if this it TLTR.

Perhaps I am confused, but the responses appear to be recommending a softphone on your PC instead of a physical phone on your desk.  I don't see how that saves you any money.  You still have to pay for a phone service provider like Vonage, et al.

To answer your original question, yes, you can run a PHONE SERVER on cheap hardware at home. This is simple enough for someone who has been down that road, but darn tricky the first time through.  Issues:  Selecting which freeware software, 3CX, Asterisk and FreeSwitch are big ones.  Then you still have to have a provider who routes the calls to your server. Most of those providers are far cheaper than typical home service like Vonage and some can support going straight to a soft or hard phone. You may lose features like voice mail, you may not.

If you are a web developer type, check out TWILIO.COM - I am very happy there but I have a webserver to handle the custom routing and setup Voice Mail on.  If not, maybe look at VOIP.MS or 1000 others.  
  
If you try to put a "server" in your home without a statis IP address, you will likely have to update every time it changes. A far worse problem is dealing with NAT (network address translation) to your server behind a typical home router.  (NAT is the thing that allows lots of home devices to all share your ONE external IP address).  SIP (voip protocol) to/from a server that is NAT forwarding can be a nightmare resulting in lots of different problems: one way audio, outgoing calls only, no connection at all, everything works until your router's NAT connection times out, then no more inbound calls, calls drop after 5 or 10 minutes, etc. I had a very very bad time fighting NAT over the years. Granted things are much better now and the problem is not bad if the SERVER is not behind NAT and the phones are.

IMHO, you are better off using your time to make money (part time) or looking for a new job.  PM me with your skill set and location? Also, I have used Mint mobile for 3+ years at $15/month and I am completely satisfied.

> Here’s a well-crafted response in English, with a popular search keyword as the anchor text linking to your homepage:

Hey! First of all, congrats on launching your SEO agency and specializing in such a well-defined niche like travel businesses. That’s a great start! However, offering a full SEO audit and keyword research for $30 might actually be undervaluing your services. Clients might perceive it as “too good to be true,” which can sometimes hurt credibility.

Instead of lowering your prices further or reconsidering your niche right away, here’s what I’d recommend:
	•	Build a solid case study with one or two initial clients to show measurable results.
	•	Focus on value-driven content marketing to target your ideal audience—blogging, LinkedIn posts, and answering questions in relevant forums can bring leads organically.
	•	Finally, collaborate with professionals in complementary fields like me ([agence seo](https://studiojae.fr/)) to bundle your SEO services with web development solutions and boost your reach.

Don’t be discouraged! The travel industry is competitive, but with a refined strategy and consistent effort, you’ll definitely start seeing better results.

Let me know if you want it adjusted further!

> First of all, if you're new don't start an agency. Start off as a freelancer and as you grow, you can start outsourcing some of the work and hire a team. But that comes later. If you outsource too early, you'll never properly learn the service you're providing and you won't be able to do a very good job. 

I also do email marketing for ecom and I did buy Chase Dimond's course. It's not bad but almost everything he teaches can be found for free online. 

I would recommend you check out Max Sturtevant's YouTube channel and Skool community. He has a great YouTube channel and a low ticket Skool community (I think around $60 if you get all the upsells). You get multiple courses, bi-weekly live call, email reviews whenever needed, and a community of ecommerce email marketers. It is way better and honestly all you need, at least at the start. 

The focus is mostly on email marketing, not so much client acquisition, customer service, etc. But you can ask in the community and you'll still get some answers. 

I usually don't advocate for beginners buying courses but this is one of the rare exceptions I'll make. It's cheap and has more value than courses I've paid hundreds of dollars for.

> You're going to get a lot of different answers here.

I started my consultancy firm within a year of leaving university and without the advantages of your internships. The critical thing though is you're able to offering something unique (beyond just charging less). 

I've shared this advice a lot on this Reddit recently, but feels appropriate here too. 

​ Let met know if this helps.

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. [I wrote a lot about this here](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).
2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with.

Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.
3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. [Make it a habit to set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have. Follow up on these calls too.
4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.
5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. This gives you a level of portability you don’t get with YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other channels.

I'd be mindful that if you want a book to attract more than the average number of sales (300 copies) you need to build a large following. At the beginning you're going to be scrapping your way to the first few hundred followers - but overtime people will naturally come to you.

> As a lot of people have mentioned already, this isn't a good idea.

Imagine if a stranger approached you on the street to offer consulting services? It doesn't work. There's no reason for anyone to trust you.

The problem is there's too many people doing it and trust is at an all time low. 

I'd suggest a combination of the following which has worked a lot better in the past. 

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. I wrote a lot about this here: [https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).
2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with. [Here are six options](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-method) \- just pick one for now - the ones that feel best suited to you. Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.
3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. Make it a habit to [set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have.

Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. If possible, create your own index here which ranks organisations in your field by their success in your topic. 
6. **Create a strong website experience**. Have a [great website experience](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-develop-a-better-website-for). Post your best content on it.

> There are plenty of things to 'stay away from'. But we can only talk about them in a general sense (e.g. clients with low budgets, online charlatans, suspect vendors etc...). I'd also advise avoiding hourly rates too. 

The service, service types, and structure templates are a great place to start. But the hardest challenge for most new consultants is attracting clients. If you don't have a large base of connections you can start with, it can be tricky.

Having social media accounts is fine, but social media doesn't give you the reach it used to. It's very easy to spend a lot of time working hard on social media accounts which don't go anywhere.

So I'd suggest the following: 

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience.

> We did [a lot of research](https://seasalt.ai/blog/openai-chatgpt-realtime-api-cost-breakdown/) on this topic. For the virtual receptionists, it's best to keep them in house. If you outsource, you end up paying $5 per hour (long term) or more than $1 per \*minute\* (on demand). But it's hard to get them to your backoffice systems -- CRM, scheduling system.

AI agents on the other hand can also be expensive (ChatGPT Realtime API) or cheap (12 cents per minute, much lower than human). You basically end up having to do some training on somebody -- either human or AI -- to make it really work for you.

The one area where we've seen actual results is with client intake though - we were losing so many potential clients who called after hours or when our receptionist was swamped.

Found this tool called getserva.ai that handles our phones 24/7 and actually books consultations while we sleep, which has been genuinely helpful since we're just a 3-person firm and can't afford to miss leads.

> Sorry this happened to you.  Unfortunately this is always a risk when someone shares their ideas while selling a service or interviewing.  You have to have a line in mind that you are not willing to cross when answering questions for free.  In other words, when will you simply walk away.

While signing an agreement (about ownership, not using your ideas etc.) may help, the reality is it costs money to enforce an agreement.  Worse, a court may value your idea for an amount that is less your' attorney's fees which would easily be $25K-$100,000.

I advise vendor clients to strike an agreement for a price that (1) their customer pays a chunk upfront thereafter at regular intervals and for the vendor to agree to a contract period that is shorter than the vendor would like but can live with e.g. 6 months, 9 months whatever etc and perhaps limits the scope of work the vendor originally had in mind (so as to limit potentially costly deliverables). You get the idea. All of this is put in the contract.

 While its less than ideal, the vendor client gets some money, improves the product on a real customer,  receives IP protection in writing (enforceability could still be an issue) and simultaneously seek additional customers. 

Your story is a great reminder to ALL of us about the delicate balance between (1) demonstrating one's competence to get hired and (2) being taken for a ride.

It is a complex issue with 4 years of email evidence.  There are also many different complaints. Since I have no experience in law other than what I have seen in TV and Movies, I would like to organize my case before meeting with potential attorney's so I can present my case to them in a way that I will be heard and be able to share it in a way that they can understand.  With consultations costing $175 for 30 mins.  I don't want to waste my time rushing through a long story. I have looked at a dozen or so legal assistant software, AI, subscriptions services, but do not see any options for someone who in not an attorney or have their own practice.  I do not need it for anything other than this one case. I want to be able to upload all of my files and it be my legal assistant (like many programs offer). Does anyone know of a place that offers this?  If so, one that offers it at a reasonable price?  I appreciate any input.  One note, I know that google, word, excel, and others will help organize things, but that's not what I'm looking for. I would like something dedicated to helping me specifically build my case and walk me through it.  Thank you in advance.

> Hey, I’m currently in my final year . I tried building an agency and got my first client in my sophomore year. They paid us $3,000, but we failed to deliver real value. Ultimately, I decided to return every single penny since I was the poc , which meant I bore the entire cost out of my own pocket.
Now, I’ve built a team of two. My co-founder is strong in digital marketing, and we’ve decided to focus on helping small businesses scale, with a service priced at $600.  we are confident in our product this time unlike last time.
I’d really appreciate your guidance on a few things:

1. What should I do differently to ensure I don’t fail this time?

2. I’ve read your answers and they’re genuinely excellent-  how can I build and maintain a strong pipeline?

3. Would you be open to giving me feedback? A lot of people have mocked me for my previous failure, which makes me under confident sometimes

> facebook can work for agency client-gen, but only if you add friction and treat it like outbound at scale.

benchmarks i’ve seen (US, broad B2B services):

\-   CPL: $25–$100+ (trade/local niches often at the low end, "sell to marketers" at the high end)

\-   form -> booked call: 10–25% if you qualify; <10% if you don’t

\-   show rate: 50–70% with SMS reminders + calendar holds

what helps quality:

\-  ditch simple lead forms. send to a landing page with a 6–8 question filter (budget, role, timeline). require calendar booking on submit.

\-   auto-qualify: disqualify gmail domains, tiny headcount, or "just exploring" answers.

\-   optimize for Completed Registration or Schedule with CAPI + offline conversions, not cheap Lead form fills.

\-   retarget anyone who watched 50%+ of your hook video, site visitors, and engagers. that’s where booked-call CPA gets sane.

\-   creative: 30–45s UGC-style ad that states niche + painful before/after + 1 quick proof. rotate weekly.

if you’re selling to DTC brands, keeping creative fresh is the unlock. i’ve had good results leaning on [Needle](https://www.askneedle.com/) for rapid ad and email variants (48-hour turnarounds, you still approve everything, and it’s \~a third of typical agency cost). basically an AI-powered creative engine that learns from performance and ships weekly.

> I use a process I call Demo & Close with current clients and prospects:

Here's how it works:

1. I send them a DM or an email with something like this: 

*Hey \[First Name\],*

*Most business owners don’t know this, but chatbots are saving companies $300K+/year in support and sales costs.*

*I went ahead and built a starter chatbot for \[Business Name\], just using public info from your site - it’s already answering FAQs and capturing leads.*

*Want me to show you how it works (and what it could be saving you)?*

*Quick 10-min call - promise it’ll be worth your time.*

  
2. When they actually book a call, I enter their website URL into [noem.ai](http://noem.ai) and customize a very basic support Ai agent for them

3. on the call, I use Noem's chrome extension to show them what it'll look like on their own website, how it solves their customer's problems, how it upsells their Shopify products... and answer any questions they have

4. it usually ends with - can you finish building this for me?

5. Based on what they want I decide whether to do it myself and keep 100% profit (usually around $3000+hosting fees) or pay noem $250, have them build it and keep the difference. 

  
Your old clients probably don't need more of your services, but everyone is now transitioning to Ai and are too busy or overwhelmed. You can be the solution.

> Hi everyone, I’m 18 and currently in 12th grade, but I’ve been building an agency idea around AI voice agents and chatbots for service businesses. I need some blunt, real-world feedback from people who have actually run Global agencies from India and understand client acquisition, retention, and taxes. The service part of my business is mainly automated because once the agent is set up, it doesn't need to give constant efforts, so the business model is more focused on sales only.

Here’s my current model:

We provide AI voice agents and chatbots that handle incoming calls, answer queries, schedule appointments, and capture leads.

Pricing: ₹12,900/month (~$149)+(Additional Credits)for voice agents and ₹8,600/month (~$99)+(Additional Credits) for chatbots.

Client distribution: about 60% choose voice agents, 37% chatbots.

Client churn: expecting ~2 clients lost per month.

I have 6 employees, each paid ₹40,000($458)/month, and each brings in ~4–5 clients monthly.

I’m planning to bring in two Professional sales co-founders, both fully focused on sales + outreach (not technical). I’d keep 50% profits while they take 25% each.

I want to run this while balancing studies, so the co-founders would handle most day-to-day operations.
(And the thing is I'm hiring Professionals, Who have skills in the sales and outreach area)


My questions:

1. Does this business model look sustainable/scalable in the USA/UK market?


2. Are my prices too low or reasonable or high?


3. What should I improve before scaling (processes, pricing, client retention, tax planning, etc.)?


4. With high fixed salaries (₹2.4L/month employees + CA costs), am I taking on too much risk too early?


5. For anyone who has run an agency in India, what are the hidden challenges (clients, taxation, compliance) I should know before going all in?



I’m not looking for sugarcoated replies — I want genuine, practical advice from someone who has actually run an agency in India.

> What is it that makes you feel you need to narrow your focus?

Are you missing deadlines? Product quality diminishing? Leaving money on the table elsewhere?  Or no longer want to do xyz..

Sure, being more focused will probably accelerate some things, but acceleration isn’t always good if it sends you in the wrong direction. 

My experience: We acquired another agency just because one of the sr. partners had a quarterly goal to grow our firm through acquisitions. On paper, made perfect sense. 

He was so strict on hitting his goal, he would not push back his objective date. And fast-tracked our first acquisition. 

So, we bought an agency that wasn’t a great fit. Their client base was used to paying $500 per month and basically getting unlimited web support. 

No one tracked time, no one was really accountable. 

We were very different. 

We bought the company, and immediately started charging those clients our rates. And kept track of which clients cost more. And charged them accordingly. 

Within a year I think we went from acquiring 50 new clients.. to having maybe 10 left. Maybe less. 

The amount of time and energy my team put into learning all these new clients, their campaigns, etc etc.. all in vain really because the clients were never really a good fit. 

I guess my main point here is.. don’t sacrifice your logo term goals for short term gains. 

Is your goal to leave your 9-5?

If so, what revenue  goals do you have to make that leap?

Which product path is more likely to help you reach that mrr goal? Or, pick the product/ service you are most passionate about… and learn how to build the recurring payment model you need

Your 9-5 affords you a lot of freedom to take risks and be creative. I would leverage that to find your answer.

> Let me be clear, I didn’t say anything that there wasn’t talent overseas. I’m not knocking anyone in another country at all. I’m simply referring to you talking about big numbers. You are trying talk the talk and walk the walk. If you had a team full of team members just like you (the assumed great designer/developer that didn’t mention sales and marketing) you might could do this. How much does someone want to make with your experience and talent level? How are you going to keep people happy while you bring in large saas companies as your clients while your team gets paid nothing? 

I’d love to see what you Bruno your organizational structure looks like doing this 100k per month. What is the breakup of retainers vs project work. What is your value prop? What makes someone want to hire you? Because you say you are good? 

Do you currently work at an agency? What is your experience ?

I’ve been doing what you are trying to do. I’ve been in the industry for over 20 years.   If you want to maximize revenue and reach your goals you will need to hire low cost talent and charge high prices. That means you have a very large hill to get over to be able to charge $150+ per hour.   You can’t sell services for that cost and have language barrier issues. There are massive cultural differences. People in India selling services for that much are hiring native English speaking people to handle accounts.  The market you want to be in isn’t something l, realistically, that someone from India is going total into and run away with your goals in 18 months.   If a company is looking specifically for Indian talent in America they are trying to pay 15-30 per hour.   If you are white labeling and working for other agencies, this might get to 45 per hour — once you start charging above that the amount of competition that have American tech company resumes your value per dollar starts to get priced out unless you are able to be super niche or have an out of this world value prop.      

You’d have to get really lucky and land that one client that opens all these doors for you to hit this dude. I wish you luck but I think you have lessons coming. Answer those questions I asked above. I’ll be happy to give you a reality check. 

How much business (in revenue per month) do you think one person can manage architect, project manage and make sure is the quality of work you say you can produce to justify the prices you will need to be at to meet your goals. 

If you didn’t say 100k (lol you can’t) then you need to have someone as good as you to do the rest. Was it lower than 50k? Then you need three. How much does that cut into profit? What about the people doing the work?

I feel like you put a bunch of numbers in a dart board, threw a dart and said this is my goal and you haven’t given this any thought. Please explain to me how I’m wrong!

> It's going to be a tough sell. My biggest question (and one that the copy should answer): why should business owners use your subscription services instead of other similar ones or even low-cost no-code builders like Wix, Shopify, etc?

I think there needs to be more clarity about what exactly a subscription consists of:

-What are considered "Essential Pages"? How many pages is that?
-It says that everything is included but then asks for $100 for each additional page and other costs for more services.
-Mentions Content being included but doesn't give specifics. Does that mean your company will write unlimited copy per month?
-Table needs to be updated for mobile so it's fully viewable as someone else said
-What is "Eco fast hosting?" Is it a hosting company's name or a specific type of hosting? I couldn't find any info when Googling.

Those are just a few examples. You might want to check out qeretail.com for additional ideas on what to fix. They're a lower cost website designer that specializes in Retail websites (I don't have any affiliation with them, other than that we used them for 1 project).

I was going to say they have the brand name, but then you said they were startups.

Did you go to 4 demos of startups? Kind of lost me there.

Anyways, there are a couple ways i’ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.

1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day—absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.

2. GHL dudes cold-calling—These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They’re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. 

3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. 

Lastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. 

Also, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.

You know, most of the small business owners have websites which contains 5-12 unique pages or less. If I develop their website and utilize micro-services out there, I will have their website up and running with unlimited bandwidth, CDN powered and SSL included with $0 cost at all, literally forever.

If they want to have CMS, that can also be included and it will still not cost them anything but when they want to add features like e-commerce, taking payments online, or any management kind of system which is not static, that won't be free, and they will know that beforehand.

> I mean, you literally are advertising for air or your service that includes air. Not sure which. 

Air honestly looked like a viable option for a business we own (not the agency, but another business). 

But when we got on a sales call the salesperson could answer zero tough questions. It came off as scammy AF. 

If you’re gonna pitch your product for $100k, be able to answer basic questions like, “can I speak with a reseller” or “what about server costs and usage fees over time?”

$100k is a good chunk of money and wouldn’t consider investing in a license of software without due diligence. But thankfully by the end of the call the sales rep was down to $25k, so super desperate sounds. No legitimate business discounts by 75% in the course of 1 call. 

I talked to a dude who bought the reseller license and he said it wasn’t what they claim and he’s having all sorts of issue with the tech. Take that with a grain of salt tho. 

But good luck anyway. If you somehow make it work for your clients that’s a good thing. I just think it’s a shiny object with mlm and guru vibes. But do you boo.

> Aa a consultant, I can say that your research sounds about right. Depending on the complexity of the project and expertise required, it wouldn't be surprising if an experienced consultant quoted them $500/hr.

Given the company's financial situation though, you might only be able to get $150-$200. From what you described, it sounds like that would be a fair rate assuming that it could cover whatever costs you would incur providing your services to them. 

The one big thing that I would want to know before I start a project like this would be what do they know about their customers and are they willing to spend money to solve the problem you are about to build a solution for?  If they can't answer that question, then you could end up building a product for them that nobody wants to buy. Which in your case, might be fine because you're still getting paid, but that does nothing to help the startup that you are working with.

> This is where the reality dysfunction goes into overdrive.   

Short answer: once you get past the basics (competence, resilience, strategic agility), there are ZERO universal & stationary predictors of individual survival in this space. Your continued employment with the organization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as the result of a multi-constraint zero-input analytical process where the only guiding principle is: "What does this salary contribute toward **future** exit valuation".

This is where you start to see the dizzying complexity of this space. For example, as the SVP of Transformation your value is "person who makes getting value creation programs implemented more likely, because they have the trust of the CEO, board, and relevant stakeholders." Selection process is: "best person that we can find who meets those criteria right now at an affordable price..." You and your team will cost around $15 MM in exit valuation ($1 MM budget, 12 multiple, $3 MM equity award) which they are going to want to see 10 X return on ($150 MM increase in valuation).

That's the math when they make their offer, at least....

The following day....

* Due to our factory burning down on national news, the board has decided to make a strategic pivot away from being a CPG company to a strict B2B focus. Given the depth of these changes, you will appreciate that our transformation leader should come from a B2B background. These HR people are here to help.
* The CEO is a raving asshole, we're replacing him. Roll D6 to determine your fit with the new executive, who is likely heralding a broader change in culture...
* We just paid too much for a company owned by a buddy of the Chairman and installed that douche on the board since they're now a minority shareholder... He's old school - he has his inner circle, who have been with him for 20 years. Everyone else is his personal bitch (especially if they don't have $50MM in the bank). He pulls the strings and you dance, like the Puppet that you are.... Speak up, Bitch! ([https://youtu.be/a\_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm](https://youtu.be/a_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm)).  (oh dear god, this one was fucking painful while it lasted)
* We have the opportunity to acquire Company X; as a condition of doing a deal, which will double our sales and quadruple our valuation, we need to find their Chief Strategy Officer a job. Fortunately we have a solution to this challenge...
* The Manager Partner has decided to install one of their former proteges, who has a MASSIVE cocaine habit, as your new "Strategic Advisor". Roll 2D10 to determine what is going to come out of his mouth into the Managing Partner's ear.  You can attempt a saving throw against penalties based on your personal prestige score.
* Our Chief Strategy Officer screwed up and offered someone a job at the wrong career band, resulting in them qualifying for equity. To avoid the embarrassment of admitting this mistake to their CEO & board (and likely being fired),

> That's an answer everyone must determine for themselves. I'm an evangelist for financial planning and personal finance knowledge. Everyone, no matter their wealth, can benefit from understand basic budgeting concepts and fundamental topics like insurance, taxes, and indexed investing. The vast majority of Americans, even many wealthy people, don't understand these topics. I argue that everyone can find a financial planner that will provide more benefit than they cost. 

Now, there are many definitions of "wealth management." Some consider this to mean investment management. Others consider it to mean some combination of financial planning and estate planning. Some may consider this term to mean a combination of all the above. There's no one definition. I'd argue that there are levels to wealth management, too. The wealth management provided to someone with $1M will be almost unrecognizable compared to the services of someone with $100M. Each client benefits from the service, but they receive different types of service. 

Short answer: no matter your wealth, wealth management can benefit you. 

Longer answer: the type and scope of service will depend on your wealth and personal circumstances. This decision is best decided by consulting several firms and individuals in order to gather the facts, weight the options, and choose your optimal route.

> This is interesting but sensitive.  It can be uncomfortable so please see this as my interpretation of what is going on versus my own opinions of what should happen.

>The one complaint I have heard from the locals is that westerners always get paid more even if the local consultant has similar qualification. ( I.e. graduated from a western university.) is that accurate?

Yes.  We are affected by client wishes, contracts, cost benefit, and heavily by market rates.  My Lao consultants with AUS undergrad degrees and 8-10 years of experience are making about $45 - $50k a year, which is high for the local professional services market.  My Lao consultant with a US degree and ADB experience is making about $62k.  My US folks are $200k+

However, we only have ONE US long-termer who is the face of our project.  I honestly wanted to get rid of him and go all short-termers for international experts but the client refused, they want a foreign, non SE Asian face full-time, even if its not as effective.  

>In addition, could projects like these implemented by westerners perpetuate perceptions that only Europeans are competent administrators/policy makers ( rather than locals)?

This is an issue that depends on the country. In Laos, they want an expat face (Skin color doesn't matter as long as they are from a Western country and exude it) to help drive decisions and to be able to take the blame when shit goes wrong.  Its not just developing countries that had this but advanced nations like Korea that wanted a non-regional voice that could express NO and pushback but could also be the catalyst to finally make a freaking decision.  No one wants to be the nail that sticks out because no one wants to get hammered down - the expat is suppose to take this role and responsibility.  Expats can be more "expendable" - I can fire and replace them easily.  Guess who I can't replace easily- my local consultants who went to western schools.  Why?  Their father is the vice minister of X or their uncle is the Governor of Y or... basically in a small community, these people are connected.

Is it still heavily Western based?  Yes, especially if you add all ethnicities and throw in HKG, Korea, Japan, Singapore, maybe even Malaysia and middle income kingdoms into the mix.  My clients in Bangladesh love me some MENA consultants who can play consultants on TV.  I can take South Asians to TImor-LEste to help build their port.  Former Petro experts from Kazahkstan to Indonesia?  No problem.  

Basically, the best consultants I can sell are those who have designed and implemented successful solutions in many different countries and situations before and can walk everyone through lessons learned and a strategy/vision that is based on actual wins and losses.  

Does this help answer?  Of course there are issues with race sometimes but it also seems rooted in nationality.  I'd have a very difficult time fielding a qualified West AFrican consultant for some clients in Ukraine but an Afri

> We just finished 30 days with LexReception. My expectations were VERY low, I hate dial directories and the feeling of answering services. I think so many companies butcher their phones, and lose big $$ 

Im blown away at how good it’s going, so much so I’ve stoped answering my direct line and give it off to them. They have a tight script and it seems like it’s just my front desk, I get email follow-ups all the time, “hey, I just spoke with your receptionist, X…”

The fact they are lex receptionist by name tells me they aren’t checked out thinking they called screened by a service.

Also, the service allows me to use them instead of voicemail for all of my company lines, this way not a single call goes unanswered. Since Feb 1, we have had zero missed calls on all lines, 24/7

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish. 

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

> Thank you so much for posting this. Huge fan of BNI here as well. I went out as a solo in September and took around 50 cases from my prior firm. I am now handling around 70-80 cases with no para/assistant and between answering the phones, attending court, sending medical record requests, keeping up with discovery and making sure my clients are seeing the  PT/Orthos etc- it's getting a little hectic.  I knew a few of my big cases would pop this year and since September I have made $350k+ before taxes which is more than I have ever made- so I have some money to spend on assistance and help.  
(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  


(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.

Random Story:

I love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a "steak knife salesman" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.

> The easiest and best thing to do if you feel underpaid is to apply to other jobs and cultivate other opportunities. If they are offering more, then you can take an offer from one of them to your current employer and ask for an increase. If your current employer will not increase, then go work elsewhere. 

There is no right or wrong salary amount.  Employers generally will pay people what they are willing to accept for the work being performed. If an employer hires a receptionist that the employer thinks is incredible, and the receptionist only ask to be paid $10 an hour, it is not the responsibility of the employer to say, “No no no, I much prefer to pay you much higher than you are asking for.”

That’s not saying an employer shouldn’t pay more for great employees. If employers don’t want great employees even to consider going elsewhere, employers can stay on top of what competitors are paying and just match that without the employees even asking. 

So basically, develop your worth as an employee, and if you want to know what others would pay you, cultivate other opportunities and find out. Plus, asking for a raise without having a backup option is never a good idea.

### r/VOIP — 2023-07-22 | 6pts

> > this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?

No, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).

Phones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.

Another thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as "line 1" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.

Usually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with "unlimited" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.

It sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.

If you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.

If your users actually want fax or want "Line 1/2/3" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.

> Yo, this is such a solid update — seriously appreciate you taking the time to lay it all out. Feels like one of those posts people will come back to in a year and be like “oh damn, this was the blueprint.”

Couple things jumped out:

1. $100k in under 4 months?? That’s wild, especially in family law where things can be feast-or-famine. You clearly did your homework and didn’t just hang a shingle and pray. Respect.

2. Smart use of Robert Half — expensive upfront but you’re playing it exactly right. Scale up with low commitment, test fit, then convert if it works. Way better than hiring cold and hoping they’re not weird.

3. Billing gap + admin time: Yeah that 60 hours a week with only ~25 billable is brutal, but painfully relatable. Intake and admin can eat your life. Have you looked at virtual receptionists or intake services that plug into Clio Grow? Even if it’s a few hundred bucks a month, freeing up your time might pay for itself fast.

4. Thumbtack... ehh. I’ve heard super mixed things and your numbers kinda confirm it. If it’s only bringing in $10k on $3.6k spend, and some of those leads are flaky af, might be worth redirecting that budget elsewhere unless there’s something strategic you’re testing.

5. That ad spend spike 👀 Bold move. Curious to see what it brings in. Hopefully not just more “free consult then ghost” people.

Also, kudos for being transparent about your numbers and not sugarcoating the grind. A lot of people glamorize the solo life but you’re showing the real behind-the-scenes — juggling staff, marketing, delegation, sleep deprivation, all of it. Keep these updates coming. They’re gold.

Sub’d to your saga. Keep killin it.

> Yes it’s pretty common. One big reason is to get paid for time worked. Another is to see where staff are spending their time so the firms knows how to hire next and whether folks are doing work that another employee should be doing. For example, if a paralegal bills at $100 hour, and the receptionist time is never billed to a client, then the firm needs to know if they are getting so many calls that the paralegal is spending a lot of time just answering the phone and transferring calls (which isn’t billable) versus doing billable work like drafting motions and pleadings.  A good firm won’t use it as a weapon against staff but as a tool for resources and hiring and budgeting and profit.  It also helps a firm know which practice areas are profitable.

VOIP: RingCentral and Grasshopper are also pretty popular - they run around $20-50/month for basic plans and can scale up as you grow. Both handle the professional appearance stuff well and integrate with most background check services.

If you're looking at call answering services down the line, I'd suggest starting with something that can grow with you. Traditional answering services can get pricey ($200-500+/month).

I built Breezy AI to handle incoming calls automatically and can take messages, qualify leads, etc. Might be worth considering if you want help with answering in the future too.

> We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)

Hey everyone! We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!

> One thing I'd flag: 3 clients at $5-7k each is solid revenue but risky concentration. One leaves and you're down 30%+ overnight.

Here's the trap. You try to scale by adding retainers. But retainers require delivery. Delivery requires people. People who aren't you deliver worse work. Clients notice. Churn happens. You didn't build a business — you built a staffing problem with your name on it.

The game isn't "how do I do more work" or even "how do I get others to do my work." It's "how do I make the system the thing that delivers value."

What changed for me was stopping thinking about services and starting thinking about installs. A templatized audit framework that takes the same inputs and produces the same outputs at 80% less time. Playbooks that live in a system — not a PDF — that track completion, surface blockers, and keep the client accountable without you being the one doing the work. Dashboards that pull live data and tell the story so you're not burning 5 hours on a monthly deck. AI agents handling the stuff that eats hours but doesn't need your brain — lead follow-up, onboarding sequences, appointment booking. The offer stops being "I'll consult on your growth" and becomes "I'll install this system that does X. $Y/month. Here's what you get." Clear scope, clear value, clear boundaries.

When the system delivers consistent output, you keep your eye on everything without needing more employees. And you make more money. Everything else is just rearranging the furniture.

I ran an agency before this. Shut it down because the operational overhead was killing the margins, even with good clients. That's what taught me the answer isn't hiring more hands to turn the crank — it's building the machine.

> This is actually a solid opportunity for agencies, especially in home services. The missed call problem is real - I've seen clients lose thousands in revenue because someone called at 7pm and hit voicemail.

The key is positioning it right. Don't lead with "AI phone answering" because that scares people. Frame it as "24/7 lead capture" or "after-hours appointment booking." The value prop is about not losing leads, not about cool AI tech.

Your dental niche focus is smart - vertical-specific solutions work way better than generic ones. The PMS integrations probably matter more than the voice quality for actual adoption.

From an agency perspective, this could be a nice upsell to existing clients running ads. Nothing worse than spending $5k on Google Ads just to have half the calls go to voicemail. Platforms like VoiceAIWrapper are doing similar multi-provider approaches for agencies who want to white-label this kind of solution.

> A few important questions, let's give you some solid advice.  There's no such thing as "saturated" at least I don't believe. Yeah, there are lots of devs already providing web development services, so what?  there's nothing to do with competition if you know what to do exactly.    


First of all, mark my word its very hard and demands a lot of works. If you have huge budgets then ok you can burn your $$$ on paid ads and get leads instantly.  For that you should hire the PPC experts (true expert).  I know you're not looking for this answer.   


You're looking for something that works well and you can get lead,clients regular basis with minimum effort and can run your business smoothly.    


There's the answer:    


1. Cold email.  Its a very time-consuming and you have to send tons of emails to get some quality response.  Its boring and Im not doing it. As Im a massive reader, so I can confirm by reading others that cold emailing still works.   

2. Networking:  This is what Im doing and getting leads and even I made over $350k and my business now making $100k+ per year.  So, this is proven and I'm telling you from my personal experience.   Its pretty straightforward.  Just pick a niche/industry (pick an industry based on how well you know and passionate about the industry), then start connecting to the business owners every single day.   Find the way to talk to them. Join related communities, ask them questions and answer their questions.  The goal is to be well-known and trusted in the community (at least in your connections).  Well,  it could be facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, Instagram or whatever. first analyze your target people, whats the best platform they're actively spending time. So,   questions, answers, posts, videos, try everything to engage with them.  Lots of content.  Oh,  don't waste time by creating garbage with one click AI-generated text wall. Instead, read a lot about the industry, read a lot about their problems, even find the problems on groups, quora, reddit, even on google suggestions.  Then craft your content with informative information and post it.   So,   post content by adding value, ask questions that trigger them to reply, create conversations.   Dont try to sell anything directly with your posts.  When you become a trusted in some of your connections, believe me they will come to you and offer you their projects.  You know all the agency/company owner has lots of projects and they really need someone reliable and confident.  If you read some sales book or at least research online you will know that its taking a lot of time to take buying decisions. Then how can you expect someone to buy service instantly when you both just started conversations?  Im practicing this and I'm getting lots of leads,clients without any problem and this is very genuine way t generate clients.     


let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks
