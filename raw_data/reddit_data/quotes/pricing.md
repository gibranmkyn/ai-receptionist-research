> I've hired and managed well over 100 folks out of the Philippines over the years, but mostly I.T.  I hired on JD as a contract reviewer, but I didn't directly manage them.  I know they did well, so far as I was involved in their oversight.  I have a lot of thoughts about how to make working with somebody in the Philippines work out, and a lot of stories about it.  I just can't go into them here, but I'm open to connect for a call to talk shop one day.  I'll give you notes on the holidays, 13th month pay, and employers of record, ect.

For VR and phones, I also have a lot of experience and I have a couple of tips.  Just about all of them will expect you to forward your phone to them for the first ring, but it is probably possible for you to configure your system to ring to them only if you don't answer.  I can help you if they won't and you have trouble.

I'll say this though, that does increase the chance that your callers will hang up before they answer and they probably won't hesitate to point that out.  There will be a delay as the call switches between your phone and their line, then their standard stuff between that first ring and their answer.  Personally, I think this is fine.  I suppose some practice areas it might be a big deal, but for most imho, if somebody wants to talk to an attorney, they aren't going to hang up 4 rings in.

A service is either going to bill you by the minute or by the call.  If that is important to you, then it will narrow which services you can use.  Both models have their advantage.

All of the services will ask you to pay for so much per month in advance, then bill you overages after.  If you just don't have the volume to meet their bottom teir at signup, just about every one of them are open to reducing your account to a pay as you go, but they won't sign up new accounts that way.  It is sort of a trick and no guarantees, but you can pay like as low as $10 a month for 0 calls a month, then $10 a call every call over 1, then they will deflect sales calls for free.  It is a solid deal, so long as the quality or config isn't chasing away clients.

For some folks, though, that also doesn't matter too much.  Deflecting sales and inquires outside of the practice areas is more important than catching every single qualified lead because the operation is losing too much doing that on their own.

> Hello, I know I’m late to this but this exact scenario is basically what I built my company around. I run a small, legal only answering service (Veza Reception), and a lot of our clients are criminal defense firms with high volume, short calls.

A couple quick thoughts whether you use us or not: you don’t need 24/7 out of the gate. Most solo attorneys just forward to us when they’re in court, truly slammed, or after hours, and let calls hit their cell the rest of the time. That way you’re not paying for every single call, but you’re also not losing good cases when you can’t pick up.

For costs, we bill by the minute (not per call), and we handle legal intake and basic conflict checks so you’re not jumping on the phone with people you can’t help anyway.

If you ever want to see what it would look like with your actual volume, I’m happy to set up a 2 week free trial and share the usage report so you can decide if it makes sense. You can DM me here or check us out at vezareception.com.

> There are different understandings of solo "success". For one category of practitioners, "huge success" means maximizing profit for minimal effort. For another category of practitioners, financial success is as meaningful as the quality of service provided; money is important, but not everything. People seeking the latter success should consider the following:

\#1 - Pick up the phone. Take your clients' calls. Take unknown calls (prospective clients). Do it.

\#2 - Have a client pipeline. If you don't have the connections yet to get referral work...try a combination of sources: (a) look for contract work in your discipline (small governments such as cities and counties, as well as non-profits, often outsource their legal needs); and (b) supplement your practice with a handful of private cases. The private cases are likely to make more money than the contract, so you'll be excited at how it supplements the contract income. The contract work might generate leads who want to hire you privately. Very symbiotic. 

\#3 - Bill monthly. If you don't bill, you don't have money. If you aren't disciplined about accounting, outsource this. 

\#4 - Be motivated to solve problems. When a question arises for which you don't know the answer -- try find and answer, make some phone calls. If you don't like working, learning, and researching, then you  shouldn't be a solo. 

\#5 - Invest in your own productivity and comfort. Keeping overhead super low is pointless if you your work is inhibited and/or you're frustrated all the time because you have to do things the tedious way. When deficiency of equipment / software / space is costing you, resolve it. Buy the reliable printer. Rent the office that you feel good sitting in day after day. 

\#6 - Make your own appearances. This is related to #1. Do your own initial consultations. Make your own court appearances. Clients don't want to hire your staff, they want to hire you. You might be thinking that if you do this, you won't have time to take on as many clients...and that might end up being true, but you can charge way more for time, because clients will see the quality difference. 

\#7 - Be organized. Your efficiency (time is money) depends on this. Accurate billing depends on this. Your sanity depends on this. 

\#8 - Demonstrate your \[high\] quality in small ways. When you're a hot mess, clients know you're the wrong lawyer. So be mindful about your clothes, office appearance, even the bumperstickers on your car. At your office, have water/tea/coffee available for visiting clients. Use nice business cards. Air sophistication. 

\#9 - Consider how other lawyers see you. Other lawyers will (or won't) be referring clients to you, based on what they know about you. What they see from you can mean a lot for your business. 

\#10 - Rest. Make sure you have the fuel to be successful in the first place. Make boundaries to preserve your down time. When a terrible hearing gets avoided by a great resolution...treat yourse

> Sure. I practice trademark law so it references that specifically.

Q: Can I send you long emails I generated with ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot? Can I send you ChatGPT's analysis of my legal problem?

A: Please don't use generative AI to write your emails to us. And please don't ask ChatGPT or another AI large language model (LLM) about your legal problem and paste the answer into your email to us. Whether you're a potential client or a current client, these kinds of emails make it really hard for us to do our jobs.  
    
Unlike most law firms, we don’t bill by the hour. Our flat fee model keeps our pricing competitive and transparent while allowing us to work efficiently. We are generally happy to answer any extra legal questions that you (our human client/prospective client) have for us, but we will not answer a string of nonsensical bullet points that you generated in a few seconds using ChatGPT.  
    
If we responded to everything our clients generated with AI, our business model would no longer work because we'd have to waste significantly more time on each project than we did before ChatGPT became popular. It's not fair to our other clients for us to spend so much time answering largely irrelevant questions that no human would ever think to ask us.  
    
The analysis offered by ChatGPT is almost never relevant to our clients' specific situations, and often isn't even relevant to the trademark application process at all. ChatGPT uses the web and other publications as its data sources, not real trademark application filing data. It seems to have no idea what you can and cannot include in a trademark application, or at what stage in the trademark process you should file an argument or petition against an existing trademark registration.  
    
ChatGPT is even worse at drafting emails asking us about the services we offer. AI-generated emails from prospective clients tend to include ten or so bullet points of questions that are answered right at the top of our website like "Do you offer flat-fee trademark filing packages?" and "Do any of your trademark packages include minor office action responses?" This kind of message does not benefit the sender or receiver.  
    
If you send us an email with a long list of bullet points that no human would have written before 2022, don’t be surprised if we reply by pasting this FAQ answer.

> Yeah, VXT is a VoIP phone service designed for law firms that creates an ai summary and transcript. 

At the end of the call, it prompts you to tag the call to your practice management system with the matter number. 

It creates a call note in your practice management system with the transcript and summary and it creates a linked time entry that identifies the other party on the call.

I'm using both LEAP and Clio and am sending the notes and time entries to each platform.  I plan to ditch clio someday and am duping to leap and clio so that i don't have to migrate the data later. 

VXT works with many law practice management systems running the gamut from action step to Smokeball, Clio to Leap, and many others. 

If you go with an annual plan, it's $37.50 /user /month. On a month-by  -month plan it's $50/user/month. There’s an additional charge of $5 per phone number per month. But they tell me that one phone number can work for large firms with multiple users on separate calls simultaneously, so … I ported only one number and am dropping the other three I used for direct lines and a fax line. 

Over the past six years I've searched for and demoed several VoIP services and this is the best one I've found so far for a law firm. 

The other VoIP services I've looked at are really geared towards sales and call centers, rather than a law firm environment. 

To get them to create a communications log entry and a time entry most of them require either a third party connector or a zapier build. 

Homie ain’t got time nor patience for that. 

I've used DialPad for 2.5 years and i hate it. The interface is hard to navigate, i struggle to find calls in the call history, the call flow builder bites, it drops calls, the phone often doesn't ring and my staff just get a voicemail notification. 

Plus, dialpad within the past 6 months did something annoying that requires you to use a third party connector to send a communications log entry to clio. It doesn’t sync the ai summary. It just creates a blank communications log entry. 

 I never could get zapier to import the AI summary and Dialpad creates a separate time entry for each call participant and you then have to scrutinize the bill to ensure you’re not double or quadruple billing a call that involved multiple parties. 

Dialpad claims a low per user price of $25/month, but I get hit regularly with additional charges and fees that make the price comparable to or higher than VXT. 

Another VoIP I’ve found that designed for law firms is CORVUM. Lower cost, no frills interface that works with Clio. Its best feature is a text message billing module that creates a time entry based on the character count in a given day’s text exchanges with a particular number. 

But when i used it, CORVUM did not offer transcription and an ai summary. 

Before i switched to VXT I looked at over a dozen VoIP providers and created a “wet dream” list of features that a law firm VoIP needs and shouldn’t bother with. 

VXT rated bes

> At many firms, paralegals do a lot of work that gets billed at lawyer rates.  When a new file comes in and a paralegal reads the complaint, realizes that it looks like the last 3 lawsuits filed by the same plaintiff's firm, pull the last answer filed in another case, then adapts the prior answer to the instant facts and hands the attorney a rough draft answer, and the attorney spends an additional 30 minutes to edit the document, add additional affirmative defenses the entire thing might get billed out as if the attorney did the whole thing.  If that service allows that lawyer to more hours per day there is value in that.  

In our Low Cost of Living Market most court awarded judgments for attorney's fees have paralegals at $175 to $225 and hour and most parelgals earn $50k to 75k.  

You should either charge more for every paralegal hour or pay your paralegal less.  A $117k salary for a $132/hr billiable rate is awful  Once you are over 100k of compensation why not hire a lawyer who you could bill out at much more than $132/hr.

Next, if needed, check out RingWave for answering service. They're small, but utilize US Staff, and they have no minimum $ per month. They just bill based on what you use, and it's honestly cheaper than most other per minute services.

> I’m a bit of an outlier, bad lsat, bottom 50 school, could not get into a top 250 firm.  But I’m doing well financially, nearly 20 years in, definitely worth it.   Ask me ten years ago, I was in a dead end in house job and would have definitely eventually gotten laid off and would have given you a different answer.  It sounds bad, but the beginning of your career you learn how to be a competent attorney, but the ones who make money are better at client and work generation.  And honestly, some of the best and sharpest legal minds I have ever worked with just suck at this and they end up working for someone else and their salary is capped on how much they can work. 

I have a family member in medicine and it’s a different life. If you are in a major city, MBA’s have taken over the medical profession and it’s kind of similar. You get paid a high salary and work your butt off.  Unlike law, you can go to more rural areas and get paid a lot more, but you will have to also work harder and with less resources.  Whereas law needs to typically stay close to where the action is to generate clients. 

One difference is that it is harder to be an entrepreneur in clinical medicine. In the old days you can set up a GP office and do well.  Less so today, MBA run clinics and insurance providers have all the power, the money route is to become a specialist and work for a hospital that can pay you.  The profession really got screwed by business people. Doctors are incredibly smart and hard working, but they got played.  

With law, you can at least create your own office still and learn how to find and build a practice and get clients.  With the rates that big firms have (and the quality of work received), the opportunity to undercut them is there for small and medium sized firms.  The same AI is being used by the associates in both firms, it’s just the billing rate that is different if you pay for brand name.  

So with what I know now, there is more opportunity in law for disruptive services and a better work life balance compared to other areas like medicine.  Not to mention that the entry level cost and time for medicine is much higher, so also cost out the lost income there.   If you are great at studying and just grinding and taking abuse, you can do well in both, but if you think you are more business minded and see law as a service to be sold, it can have more upside than medicine.

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

### r/LawFirm — 2024-11-22 | 5pts | Mentions: **Smith.ai, OpenPhone**

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

> I'm an attorney and do IT consulting for lawyers.  We specialize in small practices.  Here are some of the things I have learned over the years.  I have toying with the idea of doing a weekly tech live chat just to answer questions.

* Be prepared to do a lot of business stuff.  I have had a couple small and solos go back in house because they were just "tired of running a business" Others, really love the business part.  It isn't overly complex but it does take up time.  
* Set your tech up right and automate as much as you can.  There are a lot of good posters on this subreddit who give amazing advice.  Gusto for payroll and taxes, FreshBooks for time tracking and payment, QuickBooks online, Office 365 and so on.  Partner up with a good tech support company in your area.  *Make sure they use a program to backup Office365 for you*
* Cashflow is king, so work out how you will bill the client.  Local rules may determine your options.  I take our fee prior to the month of service.  I have seen some firms that will send an invoice and then auto bill a credit card at determined period of time, unless there is a complaint with the invoice.
* Costs and taxes will always be more than you anticipate.  You will have to pay more in taxes than you think.
* Try to get your contacts and mail exported from your old firm.  Partners usually get this.  Your professional contacts will be critical
* Make sure you have thought through your sales pipeline so that you always have new cases coming in.  Most partners leaving firms know their practice and know how to make it rain, so you will probably be fine.

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck, owning a business is amazing but it takes a lot effort.

> What kind of cases are you looking for.  Avoid the high dollar high competition stuff.  Sure there is good potential returns there - but you can bleed yourself dry fighting the bot spam that just eats up your dollars on pay to play stuff.  Find a good source of fee for service work - severance package review? record sealing? contract review? hoa disputes? general counsel stuff that pays the bills monthly and gives you a baseline.  Plenty of these are low dollar low competition.  Avoid "best PERSONAL INURY LAWYER" that can cost 500 dollars a click and with a few bad actors kill your budgets and give you no conversions.  You need to generate more reviews than your near peer competitor by like 2:1.  You don't even need to do work to get a good review.  Find them a good referral, send them to the self help center, be nice to take 2 minutes on the phone and help them out without providing too much and boom 5 stars.  There is just so many little low hanging fruit type things that you can do that get your name out there.  Tip staff well and leave a card.  Tell everyone that you are a lawyer.  Give your staff bonuses to refer cases and have them all tell everyone they are a lawyer.   I have been growing a firm for a year and a half - our organic traffic used to be under 200 a month on google, it's over 12,000 now and been growing like a weed.  We have a full time in house call center to handle the call volume.  We try to find a home for every call.  Something comes in that we don't do - were referring it to someone we know that does that and saving them some time searching the internet more.  Those referrals come back full circle.  Happy to answer any questions and point you in the right direction.  DO NOT JUST BLINDLY TRUST MARKETING COMPANIES.  You need to know your way around the ad accounts and make sure they arent wasting money on leads that you arent interested in.  Google has gotten bad and exact match keywords have become more broad and the broad stuff has just become an asterisk for whatever google wants.  You will see that you have to manage negative keyword lists daily or you are burning dollars.  Ad companies and google arent going to come give your refunds.  Keep your finger on the pulse of what every dollar is doing and how you are measuring those results through call data or lead data or chats or forms or email.  Whatever it is - those leads that don't convert are lost opportunity, unless you follow-up with them with ongoing email campaigns, friendly reminders, helpful blogs, etc.

> Lawmatics (tracking leads, costs per lead, cost per client, fee agreements, calendar links)—> Clio (billing, logging emails, case notes, client contact info, texting, receiving documents) —> jubilee for bankruptcy or WealthCounsel for estate planning. Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

> This is a terrible idea. Don’t even consider it. Run. 


Source: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer 

Okay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn’t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:


The only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. 

You will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. 


*Why hours on just this?*


Because a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you’ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you’ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). 

This will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. 


*How do you bill 2100?!?!*


Oh boy… you will hear the phrase “capture your time” and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don’t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you’ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn’t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn’t billable and will add up as you’re learning). 


If the mind numbing work and hours don’t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS

You can’t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It’s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. 


ID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate

> Let me clarify. The high anxiety comes from a number of factors, that when all combined, tends to increase the anxiety levels. 1. New cases in the pipeline, 2. Budgets, 3. Client demands (whether ppl here admit it or not, u r ur clients, attorney/therapist/medical liaison/ financial planner/ person they will vent to about whatever and some require hand holding.) 4. Managing the endless problems other parties throw your way all in the name of maximizing the value you get on your case (I.e billing departments, managing experts etc). And 5) ordinary litigation stressors (which isn’t too bad). 

Those PI attorneys that you are referring to as having less stress have probably built their practices up where they have a robust staff that can address all of the things I listed above. But anyone worth their a damn will tell you, building a PI practice and generating business requires more than sitting in an office answering discovery, motions and doing deps. 

PI is incredibly profitable. But its a business first. And most ppl mess up bc they don’t appreciate the demands servicing clients places on someone. While also joggling all the other stuff.

> For me, it's about a few things:

1. I get better support from customer service, tech support, etc from straumann or nobel than I might with Implant direct.

2. Straumann and Nobel have been around for 30 years, and they are going to be around for 30 more.  Can you say the same for the other companies? Short answer is no. If you have to restore a now defunct brand, that's no fun.

  
3. A patient with a Straumann or Nobel can get it restored with relatively little fuss in any state and pretty much any country.  Before Neodent was bought by Straumann, this was harder for Neodent being a Brazilian company.

  
4. Cost is the point. If I'm charging 3k for a crown but I pay $99 for the lab fee, that doesn't feel great. It's like getting your Car repaired - If I go to a mechanic to get my car fixed and its a $1000 bill and I see the breakdown of cost and the parts were $950 and labor was $50, I'm going to think I got a great deal.  If the Parts were $50 and labor was $950, I'll think I got ripped off.  Human nature works like this. I can charge $2600 to place a $600 implant much easier than I can charge $2050 to place a $50 implant even though I get paid the same.

  
5. It's what I would get in my own mouth.

> Are you even a dental professional? 

Dental offices do charge both the patient and their insurance if the insurance doesn't pay for 100% of the treatment. You'll be quite surprised how people miraculously forget, on the spot, that dental offices provide something called an, "estimate" of coverage for procedures. Billing and dealing with insurance benefits is an incredible administrative burden. 

Do you think it's fun when we can't access an insurance company's website to check your insurance benefits on your behalf because of a website outage? Do you think it's fun when you have to wait for long periods of time for customer service to pick up the phone and answer your question? Imagine having to do that in a high volume office where you lose a lot of money writing things off because some patient is haggling over five dollars that wasn't covered by their insurance.

Yes, not all dental offices charge equally. Whether it be due to their speciality/services provided, or they are an HMO, PPO, fee for service (cash) office, there will be disparity in the fees. You have less invasive treatments like dental fillings costing hundreds of dollars more than the average because a patient wants to be IV sedated. All that additional equipment and staff costs money. Not all insurance companies pay and provide coverage equally.

However, they require much higher level of examination, history taking and knowledge to do correctly. If you don’t know how to take a proper medical symptom history, you’re chances of misdiagnosing and providing ineffective treatment are high. Orofacial pain and dysfunction has an almost completely opposite split on patient education and procedure itself. Dentistry is 20% education and management and 80% procedure based. Orofacial pain is the opposite and I have numerous patients that are 100% education, behavior modification and management. Collecting on this type of treatment is difficult unless you’re cash only or taking medical insurance, which does pay for office visits and consultations. Unfortunately, dental insurance is very poorly equipped to handle Orofacial pain treatment protocols currently. I think it’s great to add trigger points  and Botox to your tool box, but realize that you can’t just do them and expect the patient to improve as it’s the other 80% that will make them better long term. As an example, Botox does absolutely nothing for long term improvement of muscle pain. It’s a band-aid that reduces force generation in the muscle and reduces pain temporarily. However, without that 80% of education and management, you’re gonna end up with patients in pain again and getting angry that your “treatment” didn’t help them. You have to have a better answer than “just do it every 3 months forever.” Reducing pain is very good thing I do hold back Botox from my patients, but everyone one of them know how to make their muscle pain better before they leave the office and knows that they will be on a revolving fire of Botox injections every 3 months if they don’t do it.

any good ways of finding orofacial pain specialists in our respective areas? Besides large academic centers, idk where to find you guys.

> HEADS UP: This is long....but from the heart. 

Many Doctors ARE arrogant, and act highly offended if a patient asks questions about their treatment. That's the reaction patients are put off by. 

Unfortunately,  many patients mistakenly believe Doctors know EVERYTHING about the science behind ALL of the products they use. So their questions,  I believe, are from a place of innocence, not challenge or suspicion.

Think of a way to answer questions you have no answer for in a way that will assure them & quiet them down, but not lose faith/trust in you. It's a slippery slope. You, the doctor, have to assess the situation.  

And yes, patients may ask questions about things beyond their pay grade; while being mindful of your time, ask if they want the long or short answer and go from there.

If they question EVERYTHING, perhaps you need to offer to schedule a consultation appointment (cash) with a knowledgeable staff member to go over the complete treatment plan and provide a handout with answers to basic innocuous questions.  That way you're not taking up chairtime or taking too much of the Doctors' time away from patients. 

I've done that many times. It's actually quite fun. 

Perhaps the patient could be required to submit a list of questions so the Doctor can answer the questions beforehand.  

Having demonstration typodonts, visual diagrams/drawings and other teaching aids is helpful too. 

In one office I worked in we had a special consultation room just for this purpose.  Every patient got one.

Just remember too much information leads to information overload. 

Simply explain you'd love to address their concerns, and need to set up an appointment (probably not covered by ins) to do that. Here are the fees.....are you interested? PIF is expected at time of appointment. Otherwise you can answer simple, basic questions as they arise. 

Personally,  I'd  recommend no less than 45 mins to an hour so they don't feel rushed. Plus, if it's not the Doctor giving the presentation,  you won't have to charge as much to where it might be cost prohibitive.  

If they start asking too many "deep" questions,  simply explain the person doesn't have a dental license and can't give medical/ dental advice.....only what the Dr. has authorized her to share. 

There's a saying that goes something like......
Most people won't remember what you did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel. 

Make your patients feel valued, appreciated, special and worthy of your time. I'll bet their beaming feelings will be included in their referrals.  

You never know who might be walking through you dental office doors next.  

Yes, it requires lots of time & pampering, but look at how super successful dental practices are known to go way above & beyond for those who want it and are willing to pay for it.  However, a good billing coder might find ways to get insurance to pay for some of these services.

> Our default policy is you get one free pass per ~5 year period as long as your reason seems legitimate and apologetic in tone. We modify that by the patient. If they have been coming for 8 years reliably, pay their bills, friendly, etc. I’m more forgiving. If we believe excuses like my spouse died, I have Covid, etc. we don’t even count that as their one freebie. 

We reiterate our 24 hour business day policy (Sunday for Monday doesn’t count as notice for us) nearly all cancellation calls and before booking anything over 1.5 hours.

Invariably, someone winds up with multiple under 24 hour cancels/no shows. We charge a $75 cancellation when it happens and require deposits of 1/2 the planned tx for the appointment. When they complain, and they always do, the front is told to tell them only the dentist can remove the charge and would they like to speak with me. If I’m not currently available, they get a call back number for that day. I always take the call or call them back…if they are too emotional/irrational to listen, I have the staff get their number whether I am available or not so they cool down some.

Most people just don’t understand the business structure. We’re not like Walmart with a cashier standing there for whatever comes in. I explain that I or the hygienist reserve special time for just them. When they call at the last minute, I still have to pay that hygienist and assistant to just sit there and do nothing as I have no opportunity to get someone else in that we can help. I tell them everyone wants dentistry to be less costly and that this is the number one thing that makes it cost more and we are trying to keep their costs down. They invariably say something about $75 being too much. I then tell them the precise number of times they did it and to think of it instead as $/each time and how we graciously gave them multiple passes before. Then it’s the, “yeah but this time my house flooded!” (Which is usually a bs made up answer if they didn’t start with it in which case we likely would have accepted the excuse and moved on before I’m involved) in which case I answer I’m very sorry to hear that, but your house didn’t flood the other 14 times and I have to draw the line somewhere. Sometimes I will pull out the this has to be a mutual respect relationship. You love that I never leave you sitting in my waiting room more than 6 minutes because I respect your time, you must respect my time as well….and you aren’t. I rarely reverse the charge because I give my well-trained front the latitude to assess the situation and decide whether to go down the charge or deposit path.

I’ve never had a bad review over it, which frankly surprises me as this has been my approach for nearly 10 years. Probably lost some patients over it though, but I don’t want those patients. Let them mess up someone else’s schedule. I tell them that too when they threaten to leave (I’d love to continue being your dentist, but honestly I would rather you find another provid

> For posterity, here is their full comms to customers:




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Customer,

As announced, VoIPo will be ceasing operations effective August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Our top priority is to make sure that you have minimal disruption and that your phone number is easily transferred to a new provider. We highly recommend VoIP.ms, an established telecommunications provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers.

With that said, we understand you might have pressing questions concerning your account, the reason we are shutting down operations and billing issues. We have prepared some questions and answers we believe are more urgent concerning this matter.

 

General Questions

Q: Why is VoIPo ceasing operations? 

A: Due to challenging market conditions, significant financial losses, and a key vendor disrupting our ability to process credit cards or issue refunds, we can no longer operate. This was a hard and difficult decision made after exploring all available options.

Q: When exactly does my VoIPo service end?

A: All VoIPo telecommunications services will permanently cease on August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Q: What if I have billing or other questions about my old VoIPo account?

A: VoIPo will provide limited support through closing via e-mail at support@voipo.com.

Q: When should I start migrating to another provider?

A: Immediately. The sooner you begin, the smoother your transition will be, otherwise you might suffer longer service interruptions.

Q: What do I do with my VoIPo adapter?

A: VoIPo is not requiring the return of any equipment. You may use the equipment with VoIP.ms (or any other provider) if they support it or dispose of/recycle it.

 

Migration to VoIP.ms Questions

Q: Can VoIP.ms access my VoIPo account to help?

A: No. VoIP.ms cannot access your VoIPo account information or resolve VoIPo-related issues.

Q: Why is VoIPo recommending VoIP.ms?

A: VoIP.ms is a well-established provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers, excellent service quality, competitive pricing, and the technical capability to handle VoIPo customer migrations smoothly. Learn more about VoIP.ms right here: https://migration.voip.ms/voipo.

Q: Will VoIP.ms honor VoIPo's rates/contracts?

A: No. VoIP.ms operates independently with their own pricing and terms. However, their rates are competitive and often lower than industry standards. See https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost and https://voip.ms/pricing. 

Q: Will my current equipment work with VoIP.ms?

A: Most equipment will work with VoIP.ms, but will need reconfiguration (ie. factory reset). VoIP.ms built this extensive knowledgebase article to h

Heck of a good business model you’ve got there. 

The good news is the entire system is stacked against  making what you want to do work and with the new rules waiting to take effect will make things much harder and much more expensive for you to interrupt peoples lives.

Here is the response from Fongo:

>Hi Alex,

>Since we provide phone service to you, we’re legally required to provide access to 911 emergency services, which we incur costs for. Unfortunately we cannot remove 911 service from your account/service. If we did not charge a fee, we would likely have to shut FreePhoneLine service down all together as it does not make sense for us to absorb increasing fees to provide free services. 

> 

>We recognize that adjustments to your bill may not be ideal, but there is no contract that states you will receive free-to-use phone service indefinitely. The service is subject to change and there is no penalty for cancelling service. We have provided more than 60 days notice for you to make other arrangements should you disagree with this change.

>With VoIP service (even if it's just the fax line like your case), we're not able to know your location when you make a call, therefore we must use a third party 911 service that will answer your call and verify your location (ask you or if unresponsive, lookup your 911 address in your account) then transfer your call to the correct area for emergency service dispatch. The costs of this third party’s services have risen to unforeseen levels due to the rapid inflation we have had in recent years. It's no longer financially viable to provide free 911 service. Your unlimited calling is still free, but 911 has become expensive and we're legally required to provide you with it.

### r/VOIP — 2024-05-11 | 3pts

> VoIP can easily accomplish this. We do it all the time using SIP Trunking (Telnyx, Twilio, VoIP Innovations, etc) and a server running FreePBX. SIP Trunking is where a provider sells a service to connect a computer/server PBX to telephone lines. There are many providers for SIP Trunking and many different hosted PBX platforms, but we find FreePBX to be simple and many features. A PBX is a computer/server/appliance that operates a physical phone system and contains all your programming, to make your extensions/apps/phones connect and pass that on to the SIP Trunking provider. Then we add a mobile app called SangomaTalk (aka Sangoma Connect). There are many softphone/mobile apps that you can use also (Linphone comes to mind if you want a free one or your provider doesn’t have a branded app), but we have found the ease of setup, security, and call quality on SangomaTalk to be superior to others in our testing on our equipment. 

The USA companies I mentioned above also operate internationally and with international numbers, but someone can maybe point you to a German provider than can do the same for a better rate and better matching your needs/taxes/etc. 

However, what you are asking for is extremely simple and should be available in any Cloud PBX offering. A cloud PBX is often sold with the SIP Trunking and PBX together as a single purchase. Everything is in the cloud, so you don’t buy any equipment. And it is priced per extension. 

You need:

1 phone number (often called a DID)
1 inbound route (programs what happens on PBX when DID called - points to ring group)
1 ring group (can ring all extensions simultaneously, sequentially, etc)
3 extensions (this is usually what you pay for when you setup this kind of service $/mo/ext)

Then decide what happens to unanswered calls. This is setup in the ring group. I assume they go to a single voicemail if all 3 extensions miss the call. But the unanswered call could also go to an automated attendant (press 1, 2, 3 system) and then go to multiple voicemails or different places based on the digit pressed by the caller. 

Outbound calls for each extension will just be setup to show your main number. This is called CNAM (caller name and number). Some providers refer to this as caller id masking but that is really an improper use of that term with VoIP and more refers to when people have multiple copper telephone lines. 
3 extensions (and, 3 mobile apps free or licensed)

If the app is proprietary then they will just send you a link to click on and setup is usually automatic. If you use a free app, then you’ll have a server address, username, and password to enter in the app. 

When you receive a call it will ring in the mobile app (this is a SIP client that works just like a desk phone). You would have options like answering calls, transferring between extensions, hold, conference, transfer to outside number, recording, etc. When you place an outbound call you just use the app and people will see your busines

> **Moving from RingCentral and looking for an alternative.**  


The issue with RingCentral isn't really the cost but the reliability. A lot of calls are missed where the app never rings on desktop or mobile. Mobile app is always logging us out etc.

Have a small team of 5 and currently have a business Phone solution with RC. We have 3 numbers. We're going to start utilizing a reception service that we pay for as part of our virtual office.

Ideally we would forward our main number calls to the receptionist service so when someone calls main number, the receptionist will answer. Example - caller would say they want to get on to billing and the receptionist would forward that call to one of the other numbers where, whoever on the team is assigned to that number on the system will receive the phone call on the VOIP system.

Would like to be able to configure it in such a way that in the event that person does not answer, we can set a voicemail or even forward the call to another number.

We don't make a lot of outgoing calls but in the event that the person in billing makes a call from the number they are assigned to, can the voip solution mask that number so it looks like the call is coming from the main number?

Last requirement would need to be mobile apps.

Located in Canada if that makes a difference.

> Short answer: VOIP is not the best tool for the job. 

Long answer:   
  
Don't overcomplicate what you're trying to do. The first, and easiest ask would be "do they(the university, presumably) have any form of call forwarding for your analog line?" Chances are they do, and you'd just have to enable that-because this is all it sounds like you're trying to do. Now, whether they'll allow this is a separate story. It's also possible, even likely, that whatever phone system they're using to provide service has an app you can install on your phone. If that's the case, there would almost always be some setup you'd have to do.

It is 99% likely that your phone line is VOIP, in that it travels over computer networks, but by the time it gets to your dorm is turned back into analog signal. This means that someone at university who runs the phone systems almost certainly has the ability to do this-whether they have the inclination(or permission) is a whole different story. 

As for adding your phone line to Unifi Talk, that's basically a no. Unifi, like any provider, can only provide service to numbers they own, and it's exceedingly unlikely you'll be able to tell the university to transfer your number to them. You can initiate a transfer of ownership from a number you pay for and manage, but I get the impression you're not receiving a bill for this in your name. 

  
Your first step should be to reach out to the IT department at your university. They likely have some sort of intranet and may already have the instructions on enabling phone features somewhere in the help section.

> >Does this mean we're never, ever able to recommend businesses or alternatives when posters ask questions? 

You are 100% allowed to recommend businesses when replying to requests in the monthly requests thread.

Otherwise if someone asks "How do I do X with provider Y?" and you respond with "You should use provider Z instead", you are breaking the rules.

If someone is looking for help solving a specific problem, it is never acceptable to recommend alternatives. It **is** however perfectly fine to say "this is a problem inherent to Service XYZ. The only solution is to change providers." This answers the question without promoting any particular competitor.

&#x200B;

>the way you are thinking of doing this is way overkill, I would recommend going with \[insert name of commonly used Voip service\] for this 

Is the "overkill" solution *the only way to do it* within the OP's ecosystem? If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say "Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider. If you want a different solution you will have to find a new business to work with."

&#x200B;

> So we're never allowed to mention names of Voip services, SIP apps, number parking services, etc. etc. outside of the quarantined threads? Is that what I'm reading? 

No. Discussions of business, services and products is not only allowed, but encouraged. The only stipulation is that it must be *on topic* and not promotional.

For example:

Someone asks "Which of these three PBXs can be integrated with Provider XYZ?"

Here is a good reply:

"XYZ Telecom, VoIP Provider W, and ABC123 all work. I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\_to\_website or you will have a bad time."

Here is a bad reply:

"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support"

One of them answers the question ("Which can be integrated?") while also giving helpful insight ("some settings misbehave"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.

If on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment" is fine, because the API requiring PHP

> wow this got hot! To be clear i’m not complaining about their actual product or pricing! I’m very satisfied there and with their API! It works for what I do, it is reliable, and the pricing fits what I need well. Doesn’t have to be the cheapest but to be clear CEO it’s a good set of products! I’m very satisfied there! 

I just wish it felt more like a partnership then calling Comcast! 

I’m not sure I want to divulge the details of my individual tickets, either here or in DM…. I don’t want to be wake up and see my account cut and be left high and dry overnight! This got a lot hotter then intended. I’m not prepared with any backup! I am totally reliant on Telnyx for my entire business core offerings. 

But I’m really glad it got your attention! I like to hear that there have been a round of investments in support, that’s a positive response! But seriously it’s lacking so so much, it hurts my heart because I like the product so much for what I do! It’s great! But man are the simplest questions so hard to get direct answers to! Like a recent inquiry just for something like “Hey what’s the billing rate for this service?” Over a week, first ticket just died with zero response… and i feel like it took near harassment by me to get the answer! But like wow, imho it’s the most simple of questions! I do have most tickets unresolved and they have just died. That seems to be extremely common with my tickets. I really like the companies that harass me about open tickets! lol I think everyone in tech knows those companies… 

CEO - Why not offer a premium support option? Like in tiers? Kinda like AWS does? What I experience is fine for some free level perhaps, but when shit hits the fan I wanna get a hold of someone asap to work with me to resolve the issue on one call! And I want quick escalations, (like after 20 minutes with tier 1). If you already do offer this, please make it dead simple to sign up online and subscribe to one a monthly billing basis! I don’t wanna talk to sales! lol… I’d pay $50-$100 a month for support one step up where someone personally gets assigned my ticket and works it and follows up daily until resolved. And not those automated updates that are like “Hey we’re working on your issue”… IMHO that response is trash and just pisses me off! They don’t count as a response to me at all, they just irritate me and remind me I have an open ticket that will probably never ever get human eyes on it again. 

My opinion and recommendation would be to focus and track one call close metrics, and work on that metric a lot! Then there would be no follow up issues, but why not do LIVE escalations on the tickets? Try hard for that one call close please! i realize that’s isn’t always possible but damn I’ve asked some dead simple questions, that result in let me get back to you, and then it dies. Your beat chance for “great” service is one call close imo! 

I think i’ll just enter all my future tickets as P1’s and see if that helps! Although support will

> This is your answer.   I work for a VoIP company and several clients want to go as cheap as possible.  They buy the phone outright and only pay for monthly service and do not pay for support or the phone lease cost.  The least expensive I have seen this cost (including all VoIP companies I know) is about $18 a month.  The company I work for charges $25 (you cannot remove support but then we offer to manage your phonebook as well).  So you'll have to ask around.

Just remember that they provide instructions usually only once to get you online.  If you have any issues after install, they bill per (half) hour for support.  With my company, we usually recommend at least a Yealink T46S (as the T26P or T28P are now too EOL).  You can find these on Amazon for $95-$105 and power supply for $10-$18 (you need the 5V 2A one).

Each service probably has a different profitability. So, for internal purposes and aligning headcount, this can also be useful.

Personally, we invoice per line item but it’s a fixed cost in most cases so we don’t bill hourly.

> If you have to ask these rather fundamental questions that any of the current (even free) chat bots could answer then I don’t think you are ready to start that firm. 

But just to be a little bit of a dick. I went ahead and asked ChatGPT for you. Consider yourself consulted:


To launch a successful AI consulting firm, here’s a structured approach addressing your questions:

1. Choose High-Ticket AI Consulting Services

	•	AI Strategy Development: Guide clients in understanding and adopting AI to transform their operations. This service often commands premium rates as it targets C-level executives.
	•	Custom AI Solutions: Build end-to-end AI systems tailored to specific client needs, like predictive modeling, automation, and optimization. Tailored solutions have higher value as they address unique client pain points.
	•	Data Science and Analytics: Offer advanced analytics, including predictive analysis, anomaly detection, and customer insights.
	•	ML and AI Training: Upskill client teams to leverage in-house AI capabilities. This can lead to long-term, high-ticket retainers.
	•	AI Implementation and Maintenance: Ongoing support and monitoring ensure client systems stay optimized, allowing for recurring revenue.

2. How to Get Clients

	•	Networking: Attend industry events, conferences, and online meetups to connect with potential clients. Partner with firms that offer complementary services.
	•	Thought Leadership: Publish insights, whitepapers, and case studies to build credibility. Contribute to AI publications, LinkedIn, and industry blogs.
	•	Referrals and Partnerships: Build relationships with other firms, especially in tech and consulting. Often, larger firms outsource specialized AI work.
	•	Cold Outreach: Identify target clients (mid-to-large firms in sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail) and reach out through email or LinkedIn with personalized value propositions.

3. Billing Structure

	•	Hourly Billing: Common for open-ended projects. Rates for specialized AI consulting can range from $150 to $400+ per hour, depending on the complexity.
	•	Project-Based Billing: Define a project scope and set a fixed price. This model works well for defined deliverables, offering predictability for both you and the client.
	•	Retainer Model: Charge a recurring monthly fee for ongoing support and maintenance. Retainers build long-term client relationships and ensure stable cash flow.
	•	Value-Based Pricing: For high-impact projects, bill based on the estimated value you’re delivering. This can significantly increase profitability but requires experience in scoping client ROI.

4. Compensation for Employees

	•	Base Salary: For skilled AI talent, average annual salaries range from $120k to $200k+ for experienced engineers.
	•	Equity Options: Especially in early stages, offering 0.5–2% equity can attract top talent and foster long-term commitment. It’s also a cost-effective way to compete with larger firms on compensation.
	•	Bonuses: Offer perform

> CGI Federal’s winning bid stretches back to 2007, when it was one of 16 companies to get certified on a $4 billion “indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity” contract for upgrading Medicare and Medicaid’s systems. Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts — GWACs, as they’re affectionately known — allow agencies to issue task orders to pre-vetted companies without going through the full procurement process, but also tend to lock out companies that didn’t get on the bandwagon originally. According to USASpending.gov, CGI Federal got a total of $678 million for various services under the contract — including the $93.7 million Healthcare.gov job, which CGI Federal won over three other companies in late 2011.
It’s also true that CGI Federal began lobbying as it started winning government work. According to OpenSecrets.org, it has spent $800,000 since 2006 lobbying on several different tax and appropriations bills. That’s nothing, though, compared to the many millions of dollars deployed by heavy hitters like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.*

Can’t be an IT contractor without doing a little bit of lobbying. (OpenSecrets)
What exactly were they responsible for?
Story continues below advertisement

According to a June report from the Government Accountability Office, a total of 55 contractors were retained to work on the rollout of the federal health-care marketplace. CGI Federal was the primary one, and had received $88 million out of the $394 million that had been spent at that point (the next biggest recipient got $55 million). Along with building sites for the states that elected to participate in the federal marketplace, it’s in charge of knitting all the pieces together, making Quality Software Services’ data hub work seamlessly with Development Seed’s sleek user interface and Oracle’s identity management software — or “designing an IT solution that is adaptable and modular to accommodate the implementation of additional functional requirements and services,” as CGI Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell put it in a September hearing on the progress of the site.

What exactly went wrong?
That is a matter of some disagreement. And the answer isn’t necessarily that CGI is wholly responsible.

Some people think that the system was underfunded: Donald Berwick, who administered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011, says the site failed because they didn’t have enough money to build it from the start. Others point fingers at the Department of Health and Human Services, which took years to issue final specifications, preventing CGI from really getting started until this spring.
Either way, it’s clear that the site itself isn’t well constructed: IT professionals told the Wall Street Journal that in addition to specific pieces not working, the whole thing was “built on a sloppy software foundation,” potentially due to the haste with whi

> I'd like to offer you some contrarian advice. I've noticed that many people have discouraged you from pursuing your idea. Here's my recommendation: take every single reason you were given for why it  wouldn't work and find solid answers for each one.

For instance, someone says you don't have a niche, then find one. If someone mentions your lack of experience, know  that if you can master a concept well enough to offer value to a business, they'll pay for it...bottom line...The means to the end don't matter as much as the end itself...especially in this internent age where one can quickly master a topic..at least compared to decades ago... I could go on and on, but you get my point. Regardless of the idea you pursue, someone will tell you it won't work. So, instead of moving on to the next thing, find answers to each of those points and keep moving forward.

That being said, if you can't find satisfactory answers or workarounds to why something won't work, especially when it comes from smart people, and I see many of them responded to you, then maybe your idea needs A LOT of refinement and you need to go back to the drawing board. But, as I mentioned, expect to keep hearing "it won't work." I'm sure Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs all received thier fair share of "it wont work", but they persevered, adapted, and found solutions to the challenges they faced.

Now if  you do decide to pursue your consulting idea and develop a valuable service or product, you might want to explore this platform that connects [small businessess](https://consultantvue.co/small-business-consulting/) with  independent consultants. Small businesses with tight budgets are more likely to support your idea provided you do develop a valuable product or service....thats my long take.... Good luck!

> I can answer this from the perspective of "why I don't run my own consultancy anymore:"

1) The acquisition - delivery paradox: You have to have clients to earn money, and that means dedicating your time and effort to deliver the best service to each client. At the same time, you have to invest time and effort in acquisition, because client contracts eventually end. But maybe the client want to keep you around and has another project for you ... now you have to somehow clone yourself, because you have two clients demanding your time. Or, you bet that the client will extend your contract, and he doesn't, so you're suddenly left with no client, no project and no income until you can acquire the next one. 

2) The middlemen - It's almost impossible for a small consultancy to get a direct contract with a corporation. Most medium-sized and almost all large companies have a "preferred provider" list of suppliers, and are very unwilling to onboard additional suppliers, especially small consultancies. So you end up having to sub-contract under one of the existing suppliers (usually one of the big consultancies or a recruiting agency). That costs you between 15% and 25% off the top. I did this for 5 years (I was a partner in a boutique), and the other company was earning €300 per day for the work I was delivering - €1,500 per week, 46 weeks per year = €69,000 per year for writing an occasional SoW to the client and issuing an invoice every month. (And they managed to fuck those up massively, even though I had recorded my working hours every day in their own SAP CATS time tracking system). 

3) The payment delay - Most clients will try to push out the invoice payments as long as possible. You can ask for net 30, but they'll try to get you to accept net 90. Even if you do manage to get agreement for net 45, it's usually between 60 and 90 days before the money hits your bank account. So, if you do work in April, you issue the invoice on May 2nd, and if you're lucky, you'll have the money in July, but in reality, it'll probably be early August. I used to work for a client who paid its bills after 120 days - their attitude was, "if you don't like it, too bad. If you don't want to wait for your money, then go find another client, because we've got a dozen other consultancies waiting to go to work for us."

&#x200B;

Today, I am in an industry management position - and I understand the situation a bit better. We also have "qualified suppliers" and it's a major pain-in-the-ass to get a new supplier on-boarded. It takes about 4 to 8 weeks for a supplier to be qualified by the sourcing department, then they have to issue a change ticket to get the new supplier added to the ERP system (master data changes are executed by the IT department). The qualification process includes a long questionnaire, credit checks, and (for some critical parts) an on-site vendor audit before the supplier can be qualified. If you aren't certified (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001, etc.), t

Inmates call our central number, input the 5-digit code and are forwarded to the person on the other end and are billed per minute (they can load their accounts using various means like stripe).

The cost of voip.ms is incredibly low, and configurability is awesome. There's a reason they are dominant in this field. They charge per use/per minute, but at a rate of like 0.005$ - 0.009$ per minute (half a penny to a penny per minute). There is no "per-extension" cost. It's all shared minutes. So very cost effective. There is no monthly fee, it's just whatever you pre-pay.

If you have problems, you can simply ask the online customer service rep to help you out. If you really need additional technical help, I can probably help (DM me). I can probably get you up and running within 2 hours or so (max 3).

&#x200B;

**Step 1 - Register** a voip.ms account. Note your 6-digit account #, ex: "345678".

&#x200B;

**Step 2 - Finances -> Add funds** to the account (eg: 15$ to start).

&#x200B;

**Step 3 - Transfer your existing office phone number to** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms)**.** (if this will be a new number aka new office, skip this step).  You will have to take a picture of your current carrier's invoice showing your name, address, account number, and phone number, to identify you;  on the same page write, by hand, "please port this number to voip.ms" and then sign. It will take about 10 days for the request to complete.  **Go to DID Numbers -> DID Portability** and follow instructions.

&#x200B;

**Step 4: DID Numbers -> Order DID(s) :** Register 1 new DID (aka: phone number). This will be a temporary number you will use to set up your office while your previous number is being ported over (or this new DID will become your actual number if you didn't have one before).

&#x200B;

**Step 5:  Sub-Accounts -> Create Sub Account.**  Create 5 sub-accounts (1 sub account per co-worker).  These will look like: "345678\_JIM", "345678\_BOB", etc.  When you create these subaccounts.  Assign voice mail number 101 through 105. By default (which is what you want) each sub-account will be assigned the DID you got in step 4, so all outgoing calls made by all co-workers via VOIP will look like they are coming from your office number.

&#x200B;

**Step 6 (optional, but nice): DID Numbers -> Ring Groups -> Create new ring group.** Name this ring group "everyone" -- and in the ring group, select the 5 sub-accounts you just created. This feature will allow everyone to receive a ring if a caller selects an option to speak to  "the first available lawyer". Everybody's phone will ring, the first one to pick up wins the call.

&#x200B;

**Step 7: Record an auto-answer message**. On

> As you can tell by all the responses, there are lots of ways to do this. Smaller firms tend to keep this in house because it allows them to keep control. In bigger firms, this gets much harder because the staffing gets pretty tough.

The first question you need to answer is whether your current set up works. A paralegal doing the calls is expensive. He/she has other skills so they may be able to do other things that make more money.  You could then hire a dedicated intake person to handle the calls. The cost differential would be small because your paralegal (theoretically) could be making you more money. But here’s the rub: you have to hire a great intake person. If the intake person sucks air, it will kill your firm. That’s why lots of firms outsource this. The intake person is a mix of legal knowledge, compassion and sales.  Good ones are invaluable. Bad ones are fatal to the firm. 

In my mind, the best next step would be to document your process with your current paralegal. Figure out what they do. How many calls a day?  How much time does it take per call?  What is the sign up rate (of the cases you want)?  No one is 100%. What are the cases you want? Don’t want?  You need a very very very detailed process so you can then go to market and find someone to do it.  That person could be an in house hire or from a service. Either way, you need to know the process in exquisite detail and be able to track the results. You can’t measure success any other way. 

Once you implement the new hire, you need milestones and metrics to measure success. This is a royal pain in the a$$ because it feels like babysitting. But you have to do it to be sure you’re not getting screwed by the new hire. If you don’t, you will be in 6 months and realize you have no cases coming in because your new person didn’t know he/she was doing it wrong (or was just bad at the job). 

As you can probably tell, I’ve done this. I own a firm and have lived this. Intake is a dark art but very important. Treat it that way and you will do well. Good luck and let us know what you did.

> These are great points. Marketing is testing. Testing the message and medium. The ONLY job Google's ad has is to get in front of people. The copy has a job, the landing page or answering person (if they call) has a job, the intake / presenter has a job. If one link is broken the whole system is inefficient. 

Like most service businesses, the least expensive client is from your database. Marketing through your database will yield great results. "How?" Give to get. If you want referrals from other attorneys then GIVE referrals to them. No one likes people with their hand out, but would help someone who helped them. 

Marketing costs time and money. Not in equal portions. Figure out what you have more of. If you have more money than time then pay for ads and SEO. If you have more time, I am a big fan of YouTube. It is free unlimited advertising. Long form works, so does short form. They are both tools to be used differently. A Solo's biggest problem is obscurity, no one knows you're an attorney. Awareness videos help with this. Again, the video's job is to get in front of people, you still need to convert them to signed contracts. Your presentation and offer need to be really good. 

Pick one marketing leg and build it out. Then when that's done, add automation to it and start with the next marketing leg. Don't start building multiple marketing legs and end up with zero completely ones.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-05 | 1pts | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> I saw several other post something similar, and you usually ask the same question.  I use smith.ai to answer my main line, and I only pay $10 a month for them.  They screen sales calls out for free.  Legitimate calls I pay them $10 a call for, with a minimum of $10 a month.  My volume fluctuates significantly, so this deal works out so well for me.

I was once very skeptical of a virtual reception service when I thought they were killing expensive leads for a client.  I put together a quality control where the line forwarded to a cloud service that recorded every call and used ai to both transcribe the call to an email notification and ran sentiment analysis on it, notifying if it detected a call going sideways.  The service forwarded right through to the virtual reception line, so it was like in the middle.  Of course, the act of recording and ai analysis was announced on the line for privacy and eavesdropping concerns, and it was disabled for callers from Illinois because of BIPA.  

I only ran this for like 3 or 4 months before I was satisfied with the service, then I cut it out to reduce cost.  Always an option if you think your VR might suck.  There are a lot of them out there that sell themselves as legal only, or even run by and mostly staffed by recovering attorneys.  Others, like smith.ai, that offer options to use your scheduler, collect payments or run conflicts checks for you.  I think if you are going that route, it is well worth shadowing their work for a bit to make sure you are getting what was promised.

If you want to know how I got smith.ai price down so low, you'll have to DM me.

Long live Beryl Howell.

> Now on to Gross Profit.

**Step 1. Calculate Cost of Sales (Labor)**
Calculate how much it costs, in labor, to service your clients. Including your time, contractors, etc.

The idea here is to ask and answer: "How many hours total does it cost to service clients?"

Let's say it takes an average of 10h per client across all roles. Break down how much time is spent per role to calculate capacity per role. You'll use this downstream to know when to hire to meet your demand.


**Step 2. Calculate Cost of Sales (Software)
Calculate how much you spend on software to service your clients. Clio Manage, law libraries, document prep software, Word, cloud storage, etc.

These are only software related to actually services the client. Not just to run your business (those are operating expenses).

**Step 3. Calculate Other Cost of Sales**
Filing fees, document prep fees, copy making, paper, ink, etc. Again, things directly associated with actually servicing a client.

---
Add all of that up for the same period you calculated CAC for and you have your **Cost of Sales**.

Now, calculate your Gross Profit for that same period by subtracting all Cost of Sales from Gross Revenues.

Gross Profit = Gross Revenue – Cost of Sales

*Gross Revenue is really Lifetime Gross Revenue; the total amount of money you make from all customers over time before subtracting costs.*

And *Gross Profit* is really Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP); the total amount of gross profit you make from all customers over time.

Take LTGP and divide it by the # of clients and you get your average LTGP per customer.

Now you can calculate your LTGP:CAC ratio.

---
## Improving the Ratio
Improving the ratio comes down to two things:

1. Reduce your costs
2. Increase revenue

For most businesses at your stage, you should focus on increasing revenue before reducing costs. A lot of folks get this backwards in the early years, run out of steam, and go bankrupt.

### Increase Revenue
There's only two ways to increase revenue:

1. Get more people to buy from you.
2. Get people to pay more.

And yes, people buy from you. Your service is your product.

## Get More to Buy
Tell more people about your stuff—that's **advertising**; it doesn't have to be paid media either.

**Increase availability** 
This is the single biggest point of leverage I see firms lose out on.

Take more calls. Follow up more and faster. People don’t just want to hire a lawyer from 9–5 (that's when they're working).

If someone calls you after hours and you don’t answer, they'll call someone else. Whoever answers first is probably gonna get the deal.

You don’t have to do this...and you don't have to make more money either.

Make it as easy as possible. 

Can potential clients text you to inquire about your services? Leads from text messages are 200% higher than form submissions and 80% higher than phone calls across the data I have.

> i’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve been done dirty by a lot of marketing companies.

I’d make a couple of suggestions:

1. Work really hard at getting positive Google reviews. You simply ask clients who you believe or satisfied if they’re willing to give you five stars and to write a word or two.
If you do good job, you should be able to get reviews, but don’t be discouraged if only one or two out of five or 10 people you help actually give reviews.

2. don’t overlook YouTube videos. You can talk about common subjects or questions that your clients ask ask you without giving specifically legal answers. Of course you should always have a disclaimer that it is not legal advice. You’re giving just examples of certain situations and that every situation can be different.

3. I’m a big fan of “do it yourself“ websites and content let’s face it you are the product that people are considering purchasing. For that reason, I think it’s best that the content you post to be your very own. This takes time but when I have downtime, I use it for this and for the videos, which means I seldom have downtime as I use any spare time for marketing.

4. There are several platforms that basically offer some version of a “do it yourself kit for making a website. There are ones like Wix that are not specific to law firms. I am very fond of and us Lawlytics as they are budget, friendly and geared towards lawyers.

Many other web providers exist, but they usually charge quite a bit of money.

I also think you should avoid the various Legal directories. Door paying them to list your name in their directory and usually you don’t get a very good return on investment. I’m sure there are some lawyers who’ve had success with companies like AAVO or Legal Match but in my experience, they’ve never been worth the price.

Try not to make the mistake that I did several years ago and using somebody who promised the moon but had a flat fee monthly for their Webb service. It cost me something like 60 grand and almost put me in bankruptcy. fortunately, I learned from the mistake and was able to recover and have implemented the things I’ve discussed above. That said I would really avoid anything that requires a long-term expensive contract. I also would take with a heavy grain of salt. The promise is made by some of the legal marketing companies that you will encounter.

I wish you the best.

> Not the answer you're looking for: let your portable devices be portable devices and your office workstations be office workstations. 

Since you don't need (expensive) GPUs, a decent midrange desktop will curbstomp a laptop four times it's cost.

Dinky pathetic laptops with slow professors and tiny screens often have much, much better battery life.

Set up a network drive for each pair of systems (lappy and desk) and some type of synchronization for anything that doesn't cover.


It'll cost less overall, be far more serviceable down the road (working on desktop hardware is a cakewalk), and when the laptops inevitably croak first, you have a working system AND less money tied up in the more disposable portable one. 


If you were a huge firm maybe it wouldn't be worth the electricity premium but for a two person firm this is the way.

> We are a much newer business than those mentioned. We started in April of 2023 and have been growing our capabilities as we grow our customer base. 

Our dedicated agent service is an agent hired directly for you who only answers your calls and can also do other specific tasks that you need. It’s a completely different service. It’s more like a virtual assistant who answers your phones also and you can train on your crm..etc. 

We use the team model now for all of our customers and keep our team sizes small. 

As for our pricing, the more minutes you use the cheaper it is. It’s difficult to setup a new client and train agents on their specifics so if you just need us for backup it is more expensive, but $169 a month is nothing to have a team covering your phones for ~240 hours a month. That’s consistent with all virtual receptionist services.  We don’t just take a message for that entry level pricing. We can give quotes and schedule appointments. 

We are HIPAA compliant and PCI compliant but right now we don’t take credit cards for any existing customers because of the liability. (Maybe in the future)

We don’t have an app like Ruby, but I don’t think that’s worth double the pricing. We are small but we provide excellent service. So would you get a great customer experience with my team? Yes. Would you get an app? No.

> -This comment should be the top one on this question and every other one ever asked about LegalShield. 

The service itself is what i would refer to as a good 'value' if you use it correctly and with the right perspective. Almost all of their plans provide a will/power of attorney document for each member on a plan at no additional cost. so for your $30-$50 bucks you get an attorney discussing and preparing your basic estate plan for you. That alone makes it a good value.

Attorneys generally charge by the hour. So if you have legal concerns that really need an answer, paying $50 for a month's worth of attorneys time is (again) a good value.

It won't fix everything, and won't do everything for you, though.

I think the biggest issue Legalshield/Pre-Paid legal has always dealt with but never really bothered to address is the disconnect in their business model. Being a tiered sales company using outside sales people, they've always had people over-promising the product. There's no incentive or no real check on it since the law firms cannot be directly involved in marketing (ethics) and LS doesn't control the associates directly and harshly enough to control the expectation issue. LegalShield prioritizes catering to their sales associates over their product/the firms, so any concerns about salesmanship are largely ignored. 

If LegalShield ever bothered to actually put the product and the firms first (which would require the sales structure be de-prioritized and forcing it into second position), i think the reputation and value would skyrocket. 

Right now, all of Legalshield's marketing, training, and corporate develop prioritizes getting more sales people into the tiers and securing more associate managers to increase profit potential. That comes at the expense of expectations and market share when the sales model hasn't changed for decades and they refuse to develop an updated strategy to clear the current plateau. They're not going to grow using the same old model, and they're not going to improve their rep by supporting the salesforce over the firms as much as they do.

> In general, there is no single trick for making it work. Rather, think of it as a dozen buckets you set out to catch slow drips of clients. It might feel disappointing to put out a new "facebook page" bucket and not see immediate returns, but when you have dozens of trickles of phone calls it really adds up. 

**Here's what has worked for my EP clients:**

1. Solid SEO on your website. Make sure it's well set-up. However I doubt ongoing SEO will be valuable unless you happen to live in a city where few other EP firms are making an effort. Instead consider the following: 

1a) Write blog posts that answer common EP questions. Most people search in the form of questions. If you have a blog post that is phrased the same as their question, along with the answer, then you'll likely get a call here and there.

1b) Write blog posts that answer uncommon questions. A single blog post that answers a question no other law firm has answered will reliably generate calls for years. 

2. Facebook page - have a facebook page and a way to keep it updated every week or so. The "freshness" shows you are active and hard working. The page itself isn't going to attract new clients, but it is one of the things people check on when researching you. 

3. YELP - Don't bother advertising with yelp, but do have a business listing and work hard to get a few 5-star reviews from your clients.  Again, this won't attract new clients but lots of people research there, so you want to have a good rating. 

4. Google business listing - Probably your most important listing. Call friends, family, and anybody who might give you a good review and get a few on there. One very important aspect of this tool is to ask people to specifically mention "estate planning lawyer" or some other variation of what you do. Google treats this like gospel and if everybody in your reviews is saying you're great with estate plans, it is way more likely to show you to people looking online. 

5. Youtube - Again, it's unlikely a video of yours will result in calls (but it can happen), but I am always surprised at the number of clients who say "I was researching you and saw your video about...." You don't have to go crazy, just have a channel and a handful of videos that let you introduce yourself and the firm by perhaps answering a few questions, or describing the EP process for new clients. 

All of that is possible to do for free yourself. Here's the paid stuff:

6. Do a few online searches and see who and what already ranks for your key phrases. For example, if stupid AVVO ranks #1 for "estate plan lawyer" then consider trying out a listing on AVVO for a while and see if it generates calls.  If they don't appear, then don't waste your money. Some jurisdictions will have random sites like "thumbtack,' or "ELocal" or some other small-time directory show up #1. If they rank well in your area, try them out.  

7. Paid lead services - paid lead services can work, but are usually overpriced and often do not wo

> Hey there,

Well, you've got so many questions here. So, to answer this, I have to charge you... for FREE. :)

I was a former web designer and developer of one of the largest lawyer directories and now going solopreneur.

I prefer to use the term "SEO-friendly" for the SEO "built-in" term.

Let me grab all your concerns here:

1. Does a website need to be "SEO-friendly"?
2. Does an "SEO-friendly" website lead to an SEO contract proposal?
3. How much to spend monthly for SEO to be worked?
4. How much is the monthly cost of a website to run (not including SEO service)?

I will give you simple answers to your questions.

**(1) Yes, you are correct.**

Your website should be user-friendly. But it has nothing to do with an SEO contract. Mostly, modern-design website template has included 'SEO-friendly' as the minimum feature.

So, what makes a website "SEO-friendly"?

1. It has a good structure on the page, such as a page should have a minimum of one (1) HTML tag of H1 and has another H2 and H3 for subtitles.
2. The website should have breadcrumbs.
3. The website should have an XML sitemap to register on GSC.
4. Website load speed should be under 3 seconds.
5. That's all for now.. :)

**(2) No, it isn't.**

SEO service is a separate task from building a website. But, if you hire an SEO service, one of their jobs is to make your website "SEO-friendly" (if it isn't already).

**(3) Normally, you will see the result within 3 - 6 months.**

But here is the caveat. When you see your website rank is good on SERP, doesn't mean all the work is done. You still need to maintain the page. That's why some SEO agencies or freelancers offer monthly contracts. If you don't maintain the page, it could sink into the search engine results.

**(4) There are many parameters to put into consideration to answer this one.**

Where is the website hosted? Do you have a paid third-party plugin (if using WordPress)? Do you have another service integrated into the website? But for normal use, building a website could cost you around $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the complexity. This is just for development, not including the cost of hosting and domain. Some big agencies could charge you way more expensive.

**Simplest solution..?**

Using WaaS (Website as a Service). This is a rare term used in the internet. WaaS is a website builder platform where you can use the built-in template and all that you need is already provided on the template. With WaaS, you will save a lot more money and time.

I recommend you to check this [WaaS for legal website](https://www.tobapro.com/). This is a WaaS specific for legal websites.

They have a free trial for 7 days and you can try it for free. Worth trying.

> I graduated from a Tie r 1 and followed the yellow brick road to BigLaw.
Just over a year later got laid off subsequent to the great Lehman massacre.
Spent several years trying to find a way to keep a roof over my head and keep my dogs. I vowed to myself that when I got back on my feet I would never be dependent on an employer again.

Moved to a low COLA city, travelled to some highly compensated foreign language doc reviews to start saving up for rental properties. Also worked for a CPA who worked for HNW families and celebrities so I learned how to do bookkeeping. Gradually got a few properties going which now mean I wake up on the first of the month with the mortgages paid and about $3k to put toward my day by day operating expenses. I.e. they net about $36k/year after debt service and property taxes (yes, I made substantial improvements in each to get them from how I bought them to justifying those rents.)

While scouting for properties I got cold called by a realtor and switched to him. I figured out how to close my own houses and he asked me if I wanted him to refer me clients. I said sure and promptly approached a local lawyer who did real estate and asked him if I brought the clients and gave him 50% of my fees would he cover my malpractice insurance and teach me how to do it. He said sure.

After about 6 months to a year I could do 99% of a deal front to back with my eyes closed and adjusted my split to 90/10. Within two years that realtor, who had cold called me as his very first cold call, became the #1 producing agent in a top 3 brokerage in our region. One of his clients left sales to become a realtor and is now #10. Other realtors saw that I was a lone wolf, completely independent from the political BS and the kickbacks that abound here, and started throwing me deals.

After three years I approached the title company I work with (who I picked because they are the best and the fastest and not because one of the local real estate brokerages is telling me I need to pay them $800 a month  and use their preferred title company to get referrals) and asked them to teach me how to be examining counsel. They did and now I get EC fees on my purchaser deals, and am additionally able to deliver my deals that much faster than other attorneys who use the bigger and slower title companies and don't write their title commitments themselves.

The bookkeeping was my main gig before the real estate took off and I still keep a small group of pet bookkeeping clients (one of them pays 100% of my health insurance so that's taken care of, and the rest nets about $1k a month on top). Being a business management consultant yourself and having a professional level understanding of bookkeeping comes in REAL HANDY when your solo side gig starts taking off and you need to start doing your own escrow accounting for a real estate heavy practice.

If you are organized, do not procrastinate, and can keep track of several moving parts, real estate has an excellent do

> I've been doing legal advertising for 20 years. It is one of the most expensive areas for digital advertising.

I've got a lot I could say, but here are the basics...

*Make sure people can find and reach your practice easily.*

This is job one.

Make sure that people can find you and actually get contacted back quickly.   You've spent a fortune getting this person, don't drop the ball when they do. Phone must be answered appropriately. Phone number and email addresses accurate. No dead links.

 Google still weighs location above many other things. So make sure your domain name addresses however it is people find you. If they mostly find you by name and your group pops up easily, then you are fine.  If people can't find you without already knowing your site, you might consider updating your domain to something that addresses location and potentially  your practice area because that way your practice area and location are everywhere on your site aitomatically. You can still keep your practice name domain as a landing page. But your main site needs a name that fully supports your SEO.

THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON MISTAKE I SEE. A BAD DOMAIN.  Although it's nowhere near as common as it used to be.

These are things that are often not a one time job, but need to be monitored. 


*Spend some time on keywords.*
  The biggest success I ever had was using the form names used in an obscure branch of government law for ads and SEO because the only people that used that term were people who potential clients for this firm.  

Get real familiar with your firm's practice areas and how people find your practice areas. Note, this is different  if you are a name brand firm in your area this may be less important, but not much.  Basic content marketing and basic seo (tags and file labels and image labels and blogs and H1/H2  headings reflecting your search needs)  are basically free and shoukd be done as a matter if course. This takes discipline mainly. 

*Focus more on relationship marketing.*

Real talk, most big deals are done on the golf course, not the internet.

Even if you are a small firm that needs awareness to even get started,  building relationships with people that cab feed you business should be your main focus. CPAs and other professionals that work with business owners mainly.  Or if you get work from other firms, work on those relationships.  People hire people they know and trust.  Look at who those people are in your life. If your principles/partners are utterly incapable, you need to hire someone who can fill this role.

Other stuff that works:

Lunch and learns, as well as teaching classes can give you a reason to contact potential trial clients and keep you top of mind plus can provide evergreen content to support seo if recorded.

PR in terms of news stories, partners awards, charity events where your firms name is prominent.

Billboards- highly dependent  on area in terms roi..

A pretty website is worthless if no one sees it. 

*No one

> A template always helps.  However, absent a template work through the case in your head.  Research and review for complaint, draft complaint, file complaint, filing and service fees, receipt and review of answer, case mgt conference, written discovery, depositions, mediation/settlement conferences, motions- MSJ, motions in limine, etc, hearings on motions, pre trial conference, pre trial brief, exhibit prep, prepare for trial, trial.  Put a note that it does not include any post trial work.  Don’t forget costs and expenses, time for calls letters and emails and when you are done double it all.  Unless it will scare the client away, providing sufficient cushion by far beats going over budget.

So for me answer is no. But there are dozens of companies will say the opposite. Depends on the budget, objectives and if they are on the market for long or just beginners. 


More over - nowadays customers do not buy only by seeing something on SM channels (especially service or more expensive things). They research, check if company is not a scam, reviews and so on. Having some sm channel is nowadays a must imo but more as support for website (when customer see your page in SERP, will also check how your brand "talks" in sm), announcement board and sharing knowledge channel, than lead gen platform.

> In the very early days, I did the whole "buy a bucket of hours" thing, like 10 hours for $1000, or whatever the pricing was. It's a total pain in the ass.

 - It's not MRR because they only want to buy when they need to refill their bucket of hours
 - You're still working by the hour
 - What about when they don't use all of their hours in one month? Now you're in a roll over situation, could roll over month to month and accumulate. 
- it’s an accounting nightmare to track
- the client never really trust you when you say you use X number of hours for a task

It's just a pain in the ass. I stopped doing that pretty quickly.

The way that I price recurring services is frankly unstructured.

I look at it as a whole, and I usually chunk into things like teams. So as an example, when it comes to the web team, if I add up all of their MRR and then I add up all of their expenses in a month, am I making the profit margin that I want? That's kind of like take number one on pricing.

Next, I confirm that the price that I'm paying is not too low for the marketplace and not too high that it’s going to drive people away, even if I am hitting my profit margins. I really don't want to be making too much money frankly because then I'm just opening myself up for clients to leave for cheaper options in the future.

The final evaluation is the company as a whole, certainly in startup mode, you're not going to have the volume that you will in a couple of years, making it tough at first. I just need to make money every single month, which means I change my pricing as my volume and expenses change. 

I price in totality of the company to be quite honest with you - how is the whole company doing vs. individual services.

I know it's not scientific. I've tried going down to, like, how much do we make per hour and profit per service and person. I've done all that analysis, and frankly, it just doesn't work. I keep it very simple. The natural tendency is to make it complex with tons of data analysis, and let the data decide. Or price way higher than you should and hope for the best in the end. But in the end, it just doesn't matter as long as I'm pricing it properly for the client, pricing it properly for the market, pricing it properly for me, and I make money every month in totality, not at the line item level.

All that said, I don't want to take a hit on any given line item. For example, if you are losing money on something like say a website because you then make money on something else as an add-on like SEO. It's very easy and natural for you to say to yourself, "Well, websites are a loss leader … it’s ok.” That’s a fool's folly. You should never knowingly lose money at any level.

I know I didn’t give you a direct answer. I don’t think there is one. I also think that when people try to make it overly scientific, that’s when they get into trouble. I’m not saying, don’t analyze… You should. But it really comes down to a gut call that someone, you, needs to make.

> Hello Erik, I hope you’re still monitoring this thread as I would greatly appreciate a little bit of insight for a very specific situation that I’m currently going through. 


Background: 
Started in 4/2024 after being laid off from agency. 100% referrals for client base. I’m up to 15-20k per month. Started as niche on local service businesses. A nursery and a lawyer fell in my lap so I help them but my focus is local services in my dma. 

Question / problem I’m seeking input on: 
Currently, my largest client, a service provider of expensive outdoor projects. I have a great relationship with the owner, they very much appreciative of efforts. There is an older family member that handles the finances that has recently gotten involved in email threads, very impolite and a bit rude (this doesn’t really matter, but I’ve busted my ass for the results so I’m a bit butt hurt full transparency) (they had very poor digital presence before I got involved). I “fought” for about a month have them agree to implement form posting direct to crm & utilizing call tracking software. This has been done since mid April 2025, until then they were relying on office staff to answer phones & receive email submissions and manually entering leads into crm. 

They have been able to close about 400k in jobs since January - may from my efforts that were tracked in their crm (more accurate since April) total spend with fees is about 20k per month. Finance person is critiquing roi - fair enough. But the kicker is: 

There is 5m in estimate sent / estimate viewed status since January from my sources. I’m trying to convince them on an automated nurture sequence via sms / email as their current sales disqualifier is 3 calls/text no answer - mark as lost. 

How would you balance being a consultant to the company vs avoid spinning wheels with going back and forth with this finance person… the owner has not gotten involved in this conversation voluntarily yet - I know I need to pull him in. 

Basically, if you’re willing, I’m trying to avoid learning this one the hard way and am seeking some type of opinion on the matter. Lmk if you have any questions.

> yes so firstly ai to lower op/costs but also adding more value to your clients by additional services. as someone mentioned earlier all good making seo/ads/whatever work but if the sales process etc is lacking its an expensive problem to have. 

Maybe the answer is - 'we help you get the RIGHT traffic and interest, then we give you the systems you need to actually close revenue' 

value add for existing customers (growth and retention) + can service different types/new customers. start to position yourselves as more than just seo which is increasingly seen to be commoditized 'why am i paying this when i can get a guy in \_\_\_\_ to do it for $3.50 p/h' 

might be a learning curve for you but you sound pretty capable based on your posts + you could outsource or partner with someone.

> Thank you. I started my agency in parallel with 2 other guys who also started theirs in the same niche. And we met 2 more guys doing the same thing. Lead gen + appointment setting for Medspas.

Yes I would agree, I went a completely different route than they did right off the bat. They were much more confident in their service delivery (which back then, was based on nothing) and went almost straight away towards growing their client base. 

I do not say what I do not know. Which made it really difficult for me to sell my marketing services, even though I was the only one with professional sales experience. I was only comfortable asking to work for free with an extremely small commission on the backend. 

I knew nothing about the space: not what their services did, the effectiveness of the services compared to others, downtime, COGs, length of treatment, what tier of skilled labor was required, etc. 

I thought Botox was for lips.

My first client was cheap, that’s why she took me on. But I got very lucky. She offered like every service the space has. Over 150 different services.

I mapped every service on an excel sheet and had multiple, multi hour meetings with the owner every Sunday going over every treatment to answer all of the above questions.

In the meantime, I already sold a few moderately high-ticket, very profitable packages for her and she started to trust my judgement. Which allowed me to create an excel calculator with the treatments I found, from talking with her client base over the phone, people would want.

With essentially being allowed to do whatever I wanted, I would call her client list and based on my deduction from the discovery, I’d make a custom package for them in real time and say, “Well Sarah, you’re not going to believe it, the promo we’re running today is EXACTLY what you’ve been looking for”.

This really accelerated my knowledge of, not only the space, but also another business skill I wasn’t aware I was building: creating offers people want to buy. And being able to gauge if this was a good or a bad package based on their reaction over the phone.

Mined you, I was losing money this whole time. Was a week away from homelessness. That triggered me to finally push for “monetization”. It’s really been up ever since. The rock bottom situation was last June.

But the reason why I’m sharing this, is because you’re right. I remember just a few weeks before I hit financial and emotional rock bottom, I was talking with one of the previously mentioned guys.

He was already collecting around $10k/m (rev), which at the time seemed like an insurmountable task. And it was all from service delivery! 

He was telling me about his packages, and me obviously being familiar with the business numbers behind the treatments in those packages, told him that his clients aren’t making any gross profit from his services. Yeah, the revenue numbers look great, but after you take into account COGs AND acquisition costs, the value is literally

> When you go to the dealership and they upsell you on the bells and whistles, heated seats, heads up display, etc. The answer to “do I really need this?” Is probably “No”. You have to paint the picture for the client, and many in the thread have done a great job at doing so by explaining the potential benefits like better SEO control, data acquisition, and non-reliance on a third party vendor that is probably more expensive in the long term than your services and the cost to host the site. 

They might not actually need it right now, but you need them to understand that it would make their life easier, your services are solving their problems that they don’t know they have yet, but it’s up to you to convince them that they WILL and you’re going to help them get ahead of those problems. 

Your job isn’t building websites, it’s selling websites as a website service.

> Who is your target market and what type of videos do you do? Are there specific sectors you specialise in? 

Do your clients advocate for you/give testimonials? The most successful videographers I know have grown their businesses by recommendation/word of mouth, or because they got one or two big name companies (even if that’s ‘big’ on a local level) that gave them credibility for new clients to trust them. This is helped even more if they’ve got onto a preferred supplier list in bigger organisations. Marketing managers who go on to other companies will use them because they know and trust them. This can make it hard for other videographers to compete because it’s a bit like finding a good hairdresser - once you find them you hold onto them! 

As a long-time buyer of videography services, I definitely think the market’s changed. Brands that get customers on Facebook, insta and TikTok etc can get away with phone and app edited videos, reels etc, especially if they’re churning out a lot of them. That’s not to say that all social media managers are any good at video or even design/graphics - but some are and it works for their audience. 

That said, I know companies that pay for videographers to come and film and edit batches of content in one go that they can use for their socials over time.

Some companies, particularly those with small budgets, may have a go at making longer videos that would normally be something they’d hire a videographer for (with varying results!). If there’s someone in house who says they can do it, the technology is readily available then they’ll try and save a few quid.

I used to take a more hands on role with videographers eg I’d storyboard, script and do the interviews (I’d be edited out, but would be the one getting the interviewee to say what I wanted them to). However I don’t have time for all that now, so I use a company that, while more expensive, once briefed and I approve their approach, goes off and does everything. The final edit usually goes back and forth a few times, but they always do a good job. 

We’ve recently started doing more animated videos eg to convey company successes/facts and stats or explainer videos. The company we use for conventional videos, make animations too so I didn’t have to look elsewhere, but I know not all do so that could be an area to get into if you’re not offering that already.

If budgets are being squeezed then I can see some companies dropping or cutting back on videography, but there’ll always be sectors/organisations that need them. 

OP: whether this is a temporary lull or a permanent shift, if you’ve been going for six years, you’ve got this! You may need to tweak your target market, offer, marketing and/or pricing (by that I don’t mean becoming the cheapest in town - sometimes  raising your rates is the answer).

> I agree with the other comment about targeting startups. Especially if they have capital (VC-backed or self-funded). The angle for idea-stage can be a quick, confidential and well-polished MVP, which can go a long way if they're planning to fundraise/pitch. Sure the barrier to making MVPs is lower with nocode tools etc, but this drives higher scrutiny, competition and standards, which is where your expertise shines.

If it's more of a bootstrapped startup, you can probably negotiate a small equity share in lieu of higher upfront compensation. Obviously this is riskier but if you believe in the product, team and vision, the reward can be greater.

Aside from startups, consider the many successful businesses with established cashflow and traction in their market. Advances in AI and computing present an opportunity for many of them to modernize their workflows. Changing market conditions are pressuring many to adapt (increase their capacity to serve excess demand) or answer surging expenses (increase efficiency by cutting costs to remain profitable). In either case this will push many to vertically integrate (where you come in to build their outsourced tools in-house, or to leverage their data and SOPs with AI and automation). 

In many cases this looks like you assessing their tech stack and logically designing in-house product to replace these services and save them in the long run on subscriptions and retainers. Or if you go the AI/automation route, consulting to identify those assets and repetitive tasks to spin into systems saving them work hours (and potentially increasing conversion rates or unlocking new offers for a compounding effect).

This agency model (+ AI) is quite attractive to me and I'd love to connect and explore collaborating if anyone is open to expanding their current team or forming a new one.

> I started as a freelance copywriter in direct response, built a direct response agency after, and now I own an educational & agency growth company that helps other agencies connect with their clients.

So I’ve seen this play out personally for myself as well as for hundreads of others.

You’re lucky in the sense that your target audience is easily reachable and highly responsive usually.

I’ll answer your direct questions below:

1. I started my first agency when one of my clients asked me to get the entire sales funnel built for them, since they didn’t have a team available at the time for them to take my copy and implement it in landing pages, automations and emails. They told me to find whatever talent I needed, tell them how much money I need, and get it done. So that’s exactly what I did 😂

2. For you, it should be LinkedIn. Startup founders are extremely active there because that’s how they meet new team members, potential investors and even journalists when they need access to the press. 

Build your authority by posting 3 kinds of content: (1) case studies and examples of your work, (2) thought leadership pieces proving you understand the startup ecosystem and the problems startups face (that you can solve), (3) educational how-to content that provides step-by-step processes to solve the problems you usually deal with, to demonstrate your expertise in your service.

Continuously expand your network with both startup founders, CTOs and VCs (who can be like a factory of clients for you).

Engage with their content, comment on their stuff, like it, share it if relevant.

Start conversations with them focused on networking and building a relationship before selling. 

Build a CRM (you can even do it in Notion) of everyone you engage with, take notes about them, and FOLLOW-UP!

Hop on virtual coffee chats.

Book appointments where relevant.

Structure win-win deals.

Ask for introductions or referrals if relevant.

That’s sort of what your funnel should be like.

3. Tips on hiring: 

- Work with people on a per-project basis as independent contractors before they prove themselves. It can be a very costly mistake to hire the wrong person, they’ll be hard AND expensive to get rid of. 
- Pay talent well and offer as many bonuses as you can. Creative talent is difficult to retain.
- Make an enjoyable work environment, take care of your employees, make everyone feel like a family.
- If someone wants to leave (to start their own thing or otherwise), let them go. If you don’t and instead you propose higher salary, etc. it’s a big mistake and their self-importance will grow excessively and create problems for you further down the road.
- Assess personality-fit before hiring. Ideally you want to assess 3 things: skills, personality, and moral character in your hiring process. Skills are the least important, moral character the most.

That should give you enough food for thought for now. Best of luck!

> What’s up! I run a very profitable SFC agency. I won’t disclose how much here, but I will say my high ticket offer is $15,000. Now I’ll answer your questions as truthful as can be!! 

1. The pros is THE DEMAND which is freaking massive, and also the PROFIT MARGINS, and the fact this is where the market is shifting. People are now buying products directly from social media apps like TikTok. I’ll put things in perspective for you. When I was making $30K a month running my agency, my costs were only about $2,500 a month so I was brining in about $27,000K in profit BUT I’ll tell you also more truth behind that later on

2. Niches: I believing in Niching down but when you’re first started out, you should work with several different niches because you need to find out #1 Who you can drive results best for and #2 Which niche you actually enjoy working best with and #3 Which niches do have the money to work with you. Example, you may be super good at working with online fitness coaches, but completely suck with finance companies. Even though finance companies may have more budget, if you can t provide results for them, you won’t ever grow your business!! However DO keep industries who make money versus don’t in mind. I love working with clients who have very healthy profit margins

3. Edit videos yourself until you can’t anymore. I used to edit myself up until I was making about $6K consistently. Then I learned how to outsource (which this in itself you’ll have to learn how to do properly) 

So this is the truth about SFC Agency. It’s in high demand, which means a lot of people are starting agencies. Because of that, you’ll need to actually drive results and be good at sales to get clients. But if you can do these 2 things, this space is so lucrative. 

I charge $15,000K for my high end service. With just 2 clients, that’s $30,000K a month.

I also offer a $5,000 offer. 

With 4 clients that’s $20,000K a month 

The math shows with just like 7-8 clients you could be making $1,000,000 a year with about 20% expenses 

I won’t say everyone receives this kind of success, however, I will say if you’re determined, you can

> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Seven federal agencies paid $62 million between March 2021 and November 2022 for various contracts awarded to the consulting firm McKinsey;

Federal ministers and executives from the consulting firm McKinsey must explain themselves to elected officials of the standing committee on government operations and budget forecasts;

In 2021, the Legault government called on the consulting firm to obtain advisory services on post-pandemic economic recovery;
During the first months of the pandemic, McKinsey received $35,000 per day to advise the Quebec government.

--- 

"What justifies an open contract for the next 81 years?" asked Bloc Québécois MP Julie Vignola, expressing surprise that the government cannot hire its own specialists for such a long period.

She then questioned public administration professor Amanda Clarke of Carleton University, who has extensively studied the procurement process in the federal government.

"This idea of ​​having open contracts for 81 years seems outrageous," she replied. "I think that's where we have to ask ourselves what the point of having a civil service is."

The contract available online was awarded on August 31, 2019 and is scheduled to end on January 31, 2100. The form does not specify how much the government is to pay. Instead, it is written that it is a $0 contract for professional IT services.

The government has been in turmoil since the beginning of the year after its contracts with the McKinsey firm made headlines again. The total amount reached $104.6 million for 24 contracts awarded since 2015. The three main opposition parties want to force the government to reveal the entirety of the documents.

According to Professor Clarke, such contracts challenge a principle at the heart of the Statute of Westminster: that of a neutral, merit-based civil service that is able to serve the government regardless of the party in power.

She suggested that the government probably signed such a contract to move faster instead of having to put out a new tender each time. "It's a complicated process," she concluded.
The MP for Beauport–Limoilou tried to find out how much this 81-year contract would cost taxpayers. The senior policy advisor for the Treasury Board, Sean Boots, was cut off by the committee chair before he could answer and will have to send his response in writing.

Transparency issue

The president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union representing 72,000 members, has sounded the alarm. "The government has been relying on expensive outsourcing for years," said its president, Jennifer Carr. "McKinsey is just the most recent example."

She said such outsourcing jeopardizes the security of government computer systems, is less transparent and undermines accountability.

> Until you hire a body, get a virtual receptionist like Back Office Betty or Ruby Receptionist. Work with them to develop intake scripts. Manage your clients, matters, and money with Clio and Quickbooks. Hire a professional bookkeeper to get you on the right path and to balance your books once a month. Ours works by transaction ($x/250 transactions). Consider flat rate billing ($x for complaint, summons, svc of process, $y for interlocutory motions, $z for discovery, etc) in stages for your litigation. This saves tracking billing which is just one less thing to worry about.

> To me, a beautiful human receptionist is no doubt the best.  

For automation:   voicemail, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) etc are just an evolution of technologies. So, the next would be AI Receptionist. 

You can experience AI to make your own decision.  e.g you can try [Rosie](http://heyrosie.com/?ref=rddt) AI receptionist service. They offer 7 days free trial. It’s worth seeing what today’s technology is capable of.

The AI agent answers calls like a human using natural language. You can train the agent using your website, FAQ, or database so it understands your business. It is very interesting and affordable to start; the basic functions cost about $49 with no call time limits. Full recording and transcripts will be sent to you by email or sms. Never miss a call. 

For some people, it's hard to believe they are talking/working with AI robot. It's just too new to be accepted. It's similar to many people don't like IVR or those Press 1 for... Press 2 for... system..

> Great breakdown! Your data on the plumbing business saving $4,300/month really resonates with what we've seen in the field.

I've found a few additional patterns worth sharing:

1. Warm transfers are critical - the biggest complaint from users isn't that they're talking to AI, but that they have to repeat themselves when transferred to a human. We built a transcript handoff that solved this.

2. Voice quality matters less than latency. People forgive robotic voices but hate waiting 2-3 seconds for responses. We got ours down to <20ms and saw satisfaction jump 40%.

3. Double-booking is a silent killer in appointment flows. Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).

4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list. We implemented an AI receptionist for a home care provider that automated their 20-minute intake process, saving $200-300k annually. The elderly clients actually preferred it because it never rushed them.

Have you looked at legal intake at all? We're seeing law firms with massive ROI on qualification.

Charging more is the easiest way to make more money. As long as they're still reasonable and within ethics boundaries.

Increase rates as you can justify it and do so regularly.

### Sell More Times
Can you sell more things to people? Simple divorce, sure. Now what about name changes, new power of attorney documents, etc.

Bank future goodwill from referral partners by referring them to an estate lawyer, financial planning referral, etc.

## Reducing Costs
There are two main ways to reduce costs:

1. Get clients for less (i.e., reduce CAC)
2. Get results for less (i.e., reduce COS)

### Reducing CAC
The best way to reduce CAC for most firms (especially solo lawyers) is to get better at sales (reducing Sales CAC). As I mentioned before, being more available, taking more calls, doing it faster, and following up more are the keys here.

You spend all this money on getting leads, don’t let them go to waste by not doing everything you can to close them.

Keep increasing this until you:

- Have 16h of coverage minimum. You can always scale it back if you need. But it's not hard when texting is an option.
- Follow up with leads within 5 minutes of them first contacting you. It doesn't have to be you. You can hire and train anyone to do this. Again, it's not hard when you have a single number people can text and anyone can respond to.

**Tip:** Develop a script for closing. You can't give legal advice until they hire you. Someone else can qualify them before you close them. If you need help with this, DM me.

**Reducing Marketing CAC**
There's a ton of ways to do this. It's more of a diagnosis process of figuring out where waste/opportunity exists.

Here's how I think about it in terms of ad spend:

- How much did I spend on paid media?
- How many people saw my ad (Impressions)?
- How many people contacted me (leads)?
- How many people contacted me that were qualified?

With those numbers you can calculate your Cost per Impression, Cost per Lead, and Cost per Qualified Lead.

If one of them is a bottleneck, then you can investigate deeper.

Bunch of people seeing your ad (impressions) but no one's contacting you? Then figure out why.

Are they seeing them but not clicking to your site?

That's probably a targeting problem. Make sure the right people seeing them? e.g., let's say you're doing Google Ads, are you bidding on the right keywords, in the right geographies, at the right times? If so, is the ad copy good or generic?

If people are clicking the ads but not contacting you, then make sure nothing's broken with the page or contact method. Then, make sure your page is convincing? Are you talking like a lawyer or a person? The copy matters more than the design.

Speak to them problem. Make them feel understood. Answer the questions in advance with the page. Don't be lazy, add video. You don’t need high production here. People just want to hire someone who's real and they can relate to.

Making it easy helps too.

> What you are describing (at least to me) does not sound like a CRM exactly, more like a practice management tool (and there are MANY). I feel like most tools are geared towards PI (bigger money, larger firms, etc) so you will have plenty of options.

When I think of a CRM tool, I think about that as being something working hand-in-hand with marketing, following up on leads, prospective clients, doing follow up to book consultations (also sending reminders of upcoming appointments) and then taking the lead to "client" status.

I have used a few different tools trying to find the one that worked for me (high-volume solo criminal in Chicago). I tried Clio (hated how many steps I needed to go through to create files and a discovery soldering system which did not appear to have been fixed some three years after I left them) and Clio is about as big a name in the industry as there is. They were huge on being early adopters of integrations with other tools (something I tip my cap to). I then went to Smokeball, which I liked a lot, but at the time didn't have a Mac option, no application for my phone, limited integrations (I see now far more integrations which is great). I then moved to MyCase which was quite good and the recommendation I would make for most people. Certain levels of customization to make it your own, all the tools I would trust firms would need, PC/Mac applications and plugins, they really upped their integrations up as well. What I ran into as an issue was they had a data size cap for individual files (1GB) I routinely have files that go above that and I was stuck uploading to a Google Drive for random large files rather than having my complete file together.

I am currently with Filevine which is the most daunting, but also most customizable option there is. There are upfront costs with them that arent required with other such software, but you really can make it "your own" from layout to what sections are called and what order things appear (along with required data to be entered, etc.) but it can take serious time and not insignificant money (2,500-5000 id suspect) to get you off the ground on top of the fees for the base software itself. I do love it and continue to learn and hone the software further for document automation, AI tools that Filevine I feel is at the forefront with, etc.

For true "CRM" as I defined above, there are many of companies that offer similar tools, for a more legal focused version: Lawmatics, LeadDocket, LawRuler. I used the first two. There are companies that then white label Go High Level as a CRM tool (LawHustle as an example). I ended up going to Go HIgh Level and finding a guy through Fiverr who had GHL experience to build out my own tool, with my own workflows while not having to pay a different company a monthly premium to use the tool I can get to on my own. I am VERY excited about how the tool will work for following up with leads via email, text, voicemails, an AI Chatbot coached on my website an

> Agreed. I hate clio. In button vLex and FastCase methinks clio can only fuck it up given my terrible experience with clio. 

I’ve posted this on other threads and repost here because the same questions come up. So here’s my experience with Clio for five years and Leap since January 2025.

I’ve used clio for 5 years and become more frustrated with it everyday. I’d had high hopes early on and did deep dives on automation training and everything possible to leverage technology.

But.... Clio document automation is cumbersome and tedious. Tech support gives me contradictory advice from one call to the next. I had to create hundreds of custom fields to track basic data for automation and clio doesn’t let you sort them. Everytime i want to accomplish something easy I'm prompted to buy a subscription app.

Clio is a barely glorified Outlook / Microsoft Business abortion of a piece of Crap software platform.

And clio grow is even worse.

I even paid a consultant $3,000 to help me automate my probate practice. Money wasted.

I signed on with Leap because Wealth Counsel is packaged with Leap for a total price of $200/month per seat. 

I was very wary given my experience with clio.

But...

... I’m continually impressed with Leap. Document automation is so much easier with Leap than it was with Clio.

For various practice areas Leap has pre-programmed tables to ID and connect everybody associated with the matter. For estate planning, for instance, Leap features prompts for you to fill in all family members, all heirs, all devisees, all assets of various types, all executors, all agents,...

Then you click a button and it imports all that data into wealth counsel, where you complete the interview and create the estate plan as you normally would with wealth counsel.

So far, i have not had to create many custom fields in Leap. In clio i would have to have created dozens or hundreds of custom fields by now.

I created a deed template recently for up to four grantors and two properties. Took me about one hour.

You can even create a replicating table that enables you to program one row in a table and it will automatically create unlimited rows. So if you've got 10 heirs you program one row with the data you need to track for each heir. Then you can get the merge field data for each heir imported directly into the document you need to create.

In clio you have no such option to create replicating rows, so I’d have to build a form with a custom field for each separate item. Grantor 1, Grantor 2, Grantor 3... . And then custom fields to describe each person and their ownership interest.

So for a probate Estate in clio i’d have to build out a form with up to 20 heirs, 20 devisees, 20 creditors, with additional custom field sets for each of those 60 items. Overbuild early just in case you someday have an estate with dead heirs and lots of per stirpes fractionated shares.

In Leap i just right click on the prompt for Heir, add as many heirs as i have with contact a

> Very interesting insight. I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers. I honestly think in the next 15-20 years that having a real person answer the phone will make any company stand out.

> For standard business needs, Microsoft Azure APIs are sandboxed by default. What you upload to an AI via Azure only exists on their servers for the duration of the interaction. The Azure version of the AIs are not in the OpenAI space, are not used for teaching AI, and do not report back to OpenAI in any way. 

What I tell my clients is that we use this sandboxed Azure setup when working with identifiable or proprietary business information. There's no aspects of this that exposes the client's data to others or the AI itself. With Azure, we are leasing robot brainpower inside a closed loop. We could build our own AI in-house using open source like Llama, but Azure already offers security while providing state-of-the-art robot power.

Azure also has higher security services for people that need it. I believe they have a solution to install the AI directly in your building so you have full control and visibility to confirm the data is not leaving your walls. That costs more, but it serves the purpose for people dealing with classified stuff or needing to answer to stringent security standards. But the regular API already works this way.

> RE: OpenAI o3

The current stage is a proof of concept, but it's a real threat because OpenAI has a pedigree of improving performance at lighting speeds. For instance, the distance between GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini was about 14 months, and in that time they reduced resource utilization by like 14X (going by API costs) while maintaining benchmarks and adding features.

In general terms, think of our current stage of AI as 3 components. The pre-processing, the LLM stage, and the controller or post-processing. In the pre-processing, the system understands the prompt and can doctor it and direct it to various modules to service it. For instance, if you ask a math question, the pre-processor can pull out a calculator so the LLM doesn't have to do math. If you ask a particularly difficult question, the system can pull out Python and write itself an algorithm to solve it beyond what a normal calculator could handle. You usually don't see this stuff, it happens in the background.

The LLM stage (the actual language brain) is what we are saying is fairly close to max ability for now. We already fed the architecture all of the world's knowledge and spent years maximizing optimizations. So the current version of GPT-4o, by my guess, is perhaps \~80% as smart at doing language responses as we are going to get without a significant tech breakthrough... for now as of 2024-early 2025.

The controller or post-processing stage has tons of promise. In addition to using the pre-processor to help digest the prompt and introduce fancy modules to crunch data, the controller can run parallel processes to hack at a problem from multiple angles. We know from various tests that an LLM responds better if it has multiple chances at the same question. I've seen research that shows that a low-smarts LLM can answer as well as a smart one if it is allowed to refine its own answer 100 times in the background.

What the o1 and o3 models are doing is taking advantage of this controller / post-processing approach. They are using their smartest model, and then it tries to improve on its own answers by pursuing various iterations. The underlying LLM is still near some form of GPT-4o, but the result you get comes from multiple versions of itself trying to digest the question from multiple angles and then forming a roundtable of copies of the same robot to analyze everything the robot can do to try to come up with a perfect answer.

OpenAI proved with o3 that if you let the machine eat as many resources as it wants, it gets within range of passing the current AGI tests we have available. This doesn't mean that o3 is AGI, it means that our tests were not expecting the robots to get this smart so fast; and we need new tests that are harder and more precise in what they check for. 

o3 is still missing proper self-learning and memory systems. OpenAI is for sure working on this stuff but it's not ready yet. But systems like o3 (the proof of concept), or o1 (the current smartest robot available

> For almost any task, you can either pay someone to take it off your hands, or automate it.

Whether you can do so ethically, affordably, and maintaining sufficient quality, is a different matter.

I think practice management software like smokeball, mycase, PracticePanther and Clio Manage are absolutely worth the price just for the organization alone, and they include extra quality of life like escrow management, electronic signature, automated workflow, and document automation.  How much benefit you get depends on how much effort you put into setting it up and making sure you use it properly

Depending on your field, there may be dedicated drafting software.  Do not use AI drafting, there’s too big a chance of having mistakes, missing something important, or generating a hallucinations - not to mention issues regarding client confidentiality; do not ever put in identifying information.  You can use AI to help create an outline or rewrite a paragraph, but treat it as a dishonest college student who would rather make things up, and will insist on being right even if it’s wrong.

Then there’s CRM like Lawmatics and Clio Grow.  This helps manage your marketing and client intake.  But it still requires time and effort on your part, and might not help you all that much.  

A paralegal can do a lot of grunt work, and if you don’t want to commit to a full time employee, you can hire a virtual paralegal (paid by the hour)

You can get a receptionist, a chatbot, or an answering service to answer calls and/or chats on your website.  The quality will never be the same as what you can deliver

Bookkeeping you can and probably should get software, but that still takes up a lot of time.  The best thing you can do is hire an actual bookkeeper, they’re cheap enough.

It is possible to create a fully automated process where a client fills out a form or questionnaire online and documents are automatically created.  That has two drawbacks: (1) your client doesn’t see the difference between you and legalzoom or rocketlawyer and they’ll wonder why they’re paying you.  (2) your clients will make mistakes in entering their information, and may select the wrong options if you let them.  I won’t do it, people pay me a premium price for a premium service and I want to make sure it’s done right

> Look, I get it, I fought hard to be almost fully remote, but you are way off base in some practice areas.

>Calls can be forwarded to their home office

Yeah, but they can't forward calls to other extensions at the firm, and calls from other extensions can't be forwarded to them. This is a primary function for some support staff.

>mail can be picked up

I said deliveries. There are deliveries from clients and counsel all the time, some of which need to be signed for. Clients also drop things off periodically, and they will take a firm more seriously if they have someone at the desk full time. Fair or not.

>USPS offers informed delivery, so you know when a package arrives

So what, is the remote admin going to drive to the office to safeguard the hard drive of client files sitting outside the door? Things being delivered sometimes need to be processed in a timely manner. An extra day to handle something doesn't sound like much until your calendar is jammed.

>printers cost $300 for home office

Depending on your practice area, you might need a real office printer. Scan to email is much faster when you don't have to reload 50 pages at a time into a $300 POS printer, because the way more expensive/capable office printer is collecting dust in the filing room.

>Maybe you need a part time receptionist, but probably not more.

One of the things you didn't mention is that clients and prospective clients will take you more seriously if you have a full time office presence. These people are usually going through something stressful, and little things like that make them have morre confidence in you as a professional. That is just the reality.

> **Where would you look for businesses that can afford $1,500-$2,500+ per month?** 

Research to find niches where these rates are the norm - especially in a recurring revenue model. With a little digging about avg. marketing budgets by industry, you could likely identify a handful worth researching further. From there, find a grouping of top agencies providing your same services in those industries to find a general idea of what they charge for your same set of services. Also, try and identify those agencies sales proposition. What can you do to differentiate yourself from the crowd? 

**Where would you approach them?**

I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of clients in person. Drop off info at their office and try and get a business card or set up a meeting. Meet them at conferences and do some networking. 

I am sure cold calling and cold emailing can work in some circumstances, but higher paying clients are going to want premium services and will be leery of what might appear to be fly by night companies. Position and brand yourself as a premium service and option. 

Lastly, offer to provide some value add upfront. Business owners and operators tend to be highly competitive people. Offer to do a comparison between their website and marketing vs. their top 3 competitors and bring the results, in person, to discuss in a presentation. Bring contracts and proposals and budget suggestions. Bring a grid of a comparison of your services and pricing vs. competitors in their industry. Bring case studies of your success. Bring referral information. 

  
**What strategies would you use to break through our current plateau?**

Networking. Again, I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of someone in person. Go to conferences, go to local business meetups and groups, go to events where business owners and marketing people are likely to be. Drop off your materials and card at someone's office or building, be nice to the gatekeeper (receptionist, front desk, etc.) and get the name of the best person to contact about marketing.  

Talk to people at conferences and local meetups. Find local business groups that might let you do a presentation on marketing strategies. 

It's significantly easier to introduce yourself to someone, get a meeting with someone, setup a pitch call, etc. in person vs. over email, the phone, or a Zoom call.

> To be 100% transparent before anyone reads this, I am building a product just like.  
AI answering services can definitely be worth it, and I'll explain why:

Right now I'm working with a practice that expressed some interest. We're expecting huge revenue growth just from after-hours and unanswered calls. Why? Because they serve geriatrics almost exclusively. Senior citizens don't want to text. They just want to talk.

Typically, a practice like this will pay several dollars a minute for a virtual receptionist that's handling calls for multiple businesses. They can easily make mistakes, and of course leave a bad impression because who cares? They're not a real employee of yours.

And that's not to mention how most practices don't even account for working hours when their receptionist is on the phone. The practice I mentioned earlier showed me how they MISSED 30 calls DURING working hours. That's just within the hours of 9-5. They're doing high-ticket procedures (thousands of dollars). That's a lot of money being left on the table. This is the definition of hidden revenue that most practices don't realize they're missing out usually because they don't track this type of stuff or just sweep it under the rug as nothing.

You take a product like the one I've built -- integrates with your PMS to book appts, look up and create patients, can work with a human in the loop for extra safety.. it'll do everything a regular person can plus more with the unanswered calls, 24/7, at literally 5-10x less the COST. It can pick up the phone after-hours or if your receptionist is busy on the phone with another office or insurance after it goes through a couple rings.

Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough to help a practice make more money and does it have the potential to get better? BIG Yes. 

Just like a typical receptionist, it can make a mistake from time to time. Maybe misspell a name, have a hard time understanding a heavy accent.. but it's a lot better than I think most people realize.

More than happy to give someone a chance to call one that I've setup if they want to see what I'm talking about. Feel free to DM.

> Viable pricing and a lack of feedback loops. 

First, pricing: I spoke about it over in eDiscovery subreddit, but my goodness do these legal tech companies have no clue how to package and price these services yet. 

I've had half a dozen prospective AI clients kill their requests after hearing how billing will work, and all the rules/caveats. 

Per document at $0.90?? What is this, OCR in 1998? 

Install a package for $1,500/month on a 1GB matter???

Locked in for X-number of months minimum?

No trial periods for them to dip their toes in?

Come on... people are anxious, unsure of the viability, and unsure of the $ justification to their client and these AI providers are telling them to kick sand. They WANT to give it a try, but aren't being given the chance. 

Then the other aspect is lack of feedback loops. This is making it harder to use certain software, because there isn't a place to input AND STORE facts about the case that the AI model can continue to leverage in all assessments. There's of course prompt-based workflows where you're supposed to self-contain all of the information in the prompt, but even that has it's limits. Rel aiR for Privilege is doing better in this area, but not perfect.

Give us a separate place where we can simply say "this guy is the CEO" or "That person quit on \_\_\_\_" or "This phone call regarding \_\_\_ happened offline so there's no record of it in the data". Aka: Assumed/known facts that might not be clear from the data itself.

Google Voice is tough because their support is very limited. You can try contacting Sinch directly and explaining the situation at one of the numbers listed on their site.

https://sinch.com/help-center/

I would echo the previous comments about a SnapBack. Most carriers don’t like to do it because it’s expensive ($350 per number for our cost as a carrier, $400-500 is what we charge the customer). Your other option would be an expedited port which typically takes 24-72 hours and costs the provider around $125-150.

You should also know that ports don’t happen on the weekend or any major holiday. I would suspect they could get this sorted by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

To be clear there is absolutely no technical reason for the number to be out of service for six weeks for porting. Ever. It usually takes 10-60 minutes for the routing to update when the porting is activated.  It sounds like that’s been done and your carrier just needs to program it in their switch. You can ask them what the FOC (firm order commitment) date is/was and they should be able to provide it. That’s the date agreed upon by the winning and losing carrier that the number will be ported. Most carriers will preprogram the number in their switch prior to the FOC date to allow the service to be provisioned and outbound calling for testing. When the port is activated the only really change is to inbound routing.

Most carriers will preprogram the number in their switch prior to the FOC date to allow the service to be provisioned and outbound calling for testing. When the port is activated the only really change is to inbound routing.

Let me know if I can answer any questions you may have.

> Yes that's a very simple setup and **shouldn't** cost you that much. calls come in to the front desk and they can transfer to the proper ext or place the call in park for someone else to answer. clients can also call in the directly to the ext by dialing the direct phone number (DID). 

My quote for a customer like this would be (assuming you're in the US):

Monthly cost:  
$15 for the main number  
$10 for each ext (each includes a phone number)  
$5 for analog faxing service (or eFaxing)

Setup cost:  
FREE number porting (should be free from any carrier)  
FREE SIP Phone provisioning    
FREE Mobile app for calling  
Yealink SIP phones are my preference they run about $120+ ea (Yealink T54W)  
Polycom are my second choice they run about $140+ ea (Polycom VVX 301 or VVX 411)  
Faxing ATA run about $30+ (Grandstream HT801 or HT802)

I would suggest a POE (power over ethernet) switch, you can get them fairly cheap on amazon, if not each phone will need a power supply they run about $15+ each. Some vendors on Amazon sell them with power included. We buy directly from voipsupply and pass on any discounts we get from them to customers. You can also buy the phone from voipsupply they are a good supplier and will help with any defected phones. The POE switch can be placed after modem/router provided by your ISP they are plug and play so no crazy setup or configuring.

You get all the normal features of a PBX, forwarding, transfer, caller ID etc. call recording, voicemail to email with transcribing, FREE CRM integrations if needed.

Optional features:  
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) this is so when people call in they can hear a prerecorded voice asking them to press a button to call an ext, group of exts or a dial by name. We hire professional voice actors avg cost is about $50-80 for the recordings.

Toll-Free numbers -$7  
Texting (SMS to app) - $5  
Texting (SMS to email) - $10  
Texting (SMS to UI) - $10  


All and all this shouldn't cost you more than $60 to $80 per month for an office of that size. even at our "full price", which we never charge, this setup would cost $85 per month. Id be MORE than happy to send you an official quote for our service, if anything you may be able to use it to get a cheaper price from someone else. 

We are VoiceLift a small family owned US VoIP company that's been around since 2005 based out of FL and have customers nation wide :) if you're interested let me know! I didn't know if it ok to put up a link to our site in this post lol

> If it was me I'd try it, good VoIP service is only $2.99/month so that's not a big investment to experiment.

One might guess it would be horrible (VoIP on Starlink) but oddly people seem to be doing it with little complaint.  But keep in mind you are switched to a new satellite approximately once every 4 minutes, so it's actually quite magical that it works at all for longer than a minute or two but oddly people have found it does.

I have 15 phones distributed all over my home and a separate two-story garage a couple of hundred feet away, many of them are programmed with buttons to instantly intercom key locations, it is so convenient and works great!

Whole setup costs $2.99/month recurring and $0.015/Minute for outgoing calls (takes a lot of talking to add up). Initially I used a small form factor PC that someone was throwing in the garbage and just installed FreePBX on it.

Interesting things I've done with it: I once loaned a Wifi connected phone to my next door neighbor for a couple of months (until he moved away), was easy to provision a separate number for his incoming/outgoing calls (extra $1.99/month, so little cost I didn't even bother requiring him to pay it). I still have an extension at an office 30 Kms away from my home via a nailed up VPN connection, super convenient to be able to "intercom" from the office. I also have an IVR so the SO's calls go to sets near her without disturbing me and people can call me without disturbing her. Also having your own 12 channel conference bridge at home is cool!

People think music on hold from home is freaky :) Got to love voice mail to email and of course answering your home phone from the vacation hotel in the Caribbean is also convenient (I just threw a VPN capable telephone set in the suitcase).

No end of providers offer SIP trunking at these sort of very low monthly fees.

Note: Most of my phones are of the good used very cheap variety, a mixture of Grandstream, Yealink, Snom, et. al.

With all the enhanced call handling features and conveniences, all of it costing next to nothing, I can't imagine ever going back to the expensive normal home phone line most people have in their home.

They didn't want to answer if it was possible without selling me a service contract. I told them if it was possible, I'd pay for the service contract. The guy put me on hold and came back and said it can't be done. 
In the end, we just switched so both companies were using the same provider, but certainly a shortcoming. 
Keep in mind, that was 5 years ago and things may have changed.

> Multiple VOIP phones, one line/service/number.   
Hello all, I have what I THOUGHT was a simple request but turns out none of the VOIP providers I have contacted can assist.

I want a phone in my office and on the production floor. We are a small shop of myself plus two staff (screen printing shop) but I want a phone to ring in both places at once, so I can answer it wherever I (or in my absence someone else) can answer it. This was basic with old school phone lines, as many phones as you want, but with VOIP they want me to pay for a different number/service for every phone it appears. Is there such a thing as a voip base unit + a cordless handset?!

The phones in each room can be corded, cordless, etc, (I'd kind of prefer corded in each location so that handsets can't get lost, left off charger, etc, but I'll take any solution that put both phones on the same line/number and doesn't make me pay for two VOIP lines and works at this point.)

Additional optional complication: I have used Grasshopper for like 8 years, forwarding calls to my cell phone, want to get away from my cell phone, thus the VOIP system. I'd like to abandon grasshopper but my 800 number from grasshopper isn't portable, and apparently only their sister company GoTo can port the number to their service (sounds like Grasshopper holds "vanity numbers" hostage so you can't leave their service). So if I can make GoTo VOIP services work with whatever hardware that is out there that is ideal, otherwise I have to keep Grasshopper as my forward to whatever service I switch to, and end up paying for two services. (Had my 800 number for 8 years and all of our customers know it, so keeping the number is paramount.)

Thanks in advance for any advice ya'll might be able to provide!

> Well, this is really funny-I'm looking at the Telstra 3 manual, and it seems like it only supports analog phones, so I'm not sure how an 8861 is working already without lots of sorcery. Is it getting dial tone into and out of your home via the internet(like, to your employer?).

If so, I think this is possible, but you may need extra services-because the head scratcher for me, after looking at this manual is that the Telstra sends analog signal to the port marked phone. That's your Plain Old Telephony Service(POTS). If you have a regular ol' phone, that's where it goes. Your Cisco phone doesn't have anything like that. It needs to go in one of the LAN ports.

So, here's what I'm thinking. 

Someone picks up the Aiphone on the outside of your building. If you were just a regular chap with a regular phone, this is going to make a call to whatever phone you have plugged in-**even if you don't have local telco service**. That's just basically someone opening up a circuit in the most uncomplicated way-just a step up from 2 cups and a string.  

Now, the next step is how you connect that to the Telstra. My guess is, in a normal scenario, you'd have the phone line from the outside connect to the section marked PSTN(Public Switched Telephony Network-aka, the global phone system) and then connect the "phone" jack to anything else. That's how you'd get the aiphone to ring a \*regular\* phone. BUT, your Cisco phone is getting service from \*somewhere else\*.

If your being forced to pay for a home phone as part of your building's agreement, the answer may be way simpler-you may just have to have your home phone forward to whatever number is on your Cisco phone. The variable that's hard to account for here is that piece and that's going to determine what the solution is.

> part 2/2:

  
- My Take (again, having never used DIGITS) -



Switching away from providers' CBSS sucks, and that lock-in is what they bank on to keep you as a customer. Were I in your shoes, knowing only what you've put in your original post, I'd consider a few options:



a) ripping that band-aid off, YOLO-ing it and porting the number out. You'll incur downtime of some kind (possibly a week if everything goes right). If you can sync out those contacts into the new system ahead of time, you might not be completely effed (again, message history's gonna be messssssy).



b) starting a new service with a new phone number entirely. Give out the new number to customers and start using it for everything. Keep the old T-Mo service in place for a while, but shift everyone over to the new system. No downtime needed, but wouldn't be a quick process. Annoying and a PITA to maintain two calling/messaging systems, but would incur the fewest "oh shit it's all horribly broken and now so is our business" moments.



c) broadening our scope and looking into more of a CRM than just a calling/texting service. Example: hubspot, while I think can become cost-prohibitive if you're a small shop and try to scale up, integrates with a bunch of calling services (https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/calling). Zoho might be worth considering and integrates with things like RingCentral and Dialpad (I've not used either in a calling capacity, though RC as a company and website has felt a bit heavy/clunky to me). I don't know what you're using to keep track of all your customer interactions (I'm thinking more like the house cleanings, etc, not just calls/messaging), but it could make sense to try to integrate this into a CRM somehow. Might be totally overkill for your needs.



d) look for more a service that offers a true sms inbox. I've seen https://www.openphone.com/ (see https://www.openphone.com/blog/sms-inbox/) recommended elsewhere for calling/voip purposes (never used them, no affiliation). Looks like you can import contacts from a csv https://support.openphone.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500009861242-How-to-import-a-large-number-of-contacts-to-OpenPhone though idk what kind of flexibility/options your business needs. Dialpad I think supports shared sms messaging too (again, no experience with them). Actually, more I look into these pages, the more I think this option might be the right answer. Kinda one of the startup-y companies offering an integrated group call/sms solution with a bunch of purple on their website (cause, you know, it's the hot color right now.....T-Mobile pink is sooooo 2010s lol).



So, that's what I know. Or don't know. Idk. Hope it helps :)

> We have a small 3 person team. We are constantly on the road so primarily need a service that allows all 3 of us to reliably answer phone calls and text messages.  We started using Google Voice and it worked ok when just 2 of us but had lots of problems with dropped call.  We switched to Ooma Business about a year ago and the calls are much more reliable however lots of issues with texting. Texts don't send, we don't always get notifications, can't see texts sent by another team member, etc.  Not to mention the limit on text storage means we're constantly having to do cleanup.  Too much hassle for the cost of $25/user/month.  In short we need the following to reliably occur:

* One number to ring through to 3 mobile phones
* One number to send and receive text messages on 3 mobile phones
* Voicemail 

All of the other features like schedules, ring groups, fax, etc are nice but not must haves.

> I am not sure of your question but it seems to answer itself. You have simply purchased a dedicated FAX line that has been optimized for that purpose. While I know about the Codex issues with faxing over the Internet, I have not had to make any adjustments to do so. I use an older model OBI ATA with the CallCentric service. I just switch the phone line from the printer with my cordless phone base when I need to Fax. Heck, even the lame Google Voice service works well if I plug into that port in a pinch.

 I guess I don't fax enough to justify the cost of a separate line and clearly you mileage is better than most. It is worth more in smiles when I tell people you can fax for Free over the Internet if the document is already in PDF format. 🤑 HP has a great app for that.

> Yeah, I think overall it is a good platform, and if you're providing it to businesses it's nice especially since it is super customizable and open to so many different scenarios and use cases. Long as you understand the risks and put in place things to minimize them with the lack of cluster and node support. I was toying around with the idea of running proxmox or xen clusters to host the PBX VMs and then do some dns proxy to load balance the call requests. But I'd also have to figure out how to keep the working directories synced across them all.. or just have the clusters in a HA failover scenario to give additional failover systems instead of just one. At some point, it just became more beneficial to look at other systems that are already setup for redundancy and hosted to keep this headache and overhead cost off my plate.

And I just started providing phone services last year. I only have a little over 100 extensions set with a couple of tenants. With about 50 or so set up in the pipeline soon to be onboarded. So really I'm probably not the best judge. There are other users with a much larger customer base that would have better insight into it than me. There's a user here on Reddit named TheRealNalaLockspur that owns a company called Sipharmony that uses Vodia for its cloud system. I would bet he's the biggest player using the platform you would find around here if you want to reach out. He would be your best insight into the ins and outs of the platform. They have done a lot of in-house dev stuff to really make the platform their own from what I have seen.

I liked Netsapiens enough when I was looking at it. But when it's literally one of the major platforms out there.. It's just hard to justify a company going with you over a larger outfit that provides the exact same phone service. At probably a lower price because they can offset the costs and margins with volume. I think it's better than most other larger providers, but at the same time what differentiates you and them? Apart from support, and pricing, you're literally the exact same feature set and user experience as competing MSPs or VoIP companies in your area. Just my 2c and how I view it all. Definitely not knocking Netsapiens or anyone using it or providing it like OIT, Viirtue, RingLogix, etc. I think it's a solid platform overall.

As for alternatives I've been looking at a company called Voxo. They fully host everything, are redundant, they have one seat price for partners that include literally everything. Nothing is extra apart from toll-free and international minutes. They also collect, remit, and pay all FCC, USAC, USF, telecom tax bs on your behalf. So you literally only pay a flat fee per extension and that's it. It's a much smaller company than anyone using netsapians, or any of the other big cloud providers. Nextiva, Zoom, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral, etc. But honestly, that's what I like about them. Support is super fantastic. I literally get a response within minutes and

> The niche is the hardest, so congrats on that. 

An older IT business owner once advised me that I needed to work on finding MRR - that it would change my life. 

I went back to the shop and worked on it for weeks until I figured it out. He was right...it's life changing.

You want three things, huh? Here we go...

1. Rethink why you price projects the way you do. As an example, does your cost to build a website REALLY justify the price you charge? Or are you charging that much because you only have one shot at making money on the thing, and you know you'll have downtime after it's done? Could you lower your price IF you had a 12-month commitment?
2. For work that is naturally project work, don't just spread the project cost out over the duration. That's not MRR. That's more like providing the client a credit-free, interest-free loan they pay off over time. The idea with pricing is that you want to NOT go underwater in the beginning of the engagement while making more money during future months.
3. Start pitching MRR solutions. The longer you pitch projects, the longer you'll be doing only project work. Once you're ready, pitch your offering only as a recurring service with a recurring fee, even if upfront work is required. Clients actually like MRR solutions because they smooth the outbound cash flow and provide predictability. 

Bonus answer:

* You don't have to switch 100% to MRR. Instead, you can charge for obvious project work like building the website and obvious MRR work like hosting and support. Mix and match if you'd like. Some clients will appreciate that because the payments naturally align with the amount of work over time.

I hope that gives you a few things to think about. 

Keep at it. MRR will change your life.

> I tell them the SEO industry is full of snake oil salesman and scammers. It’s a Wild West out there and anyone can be anything. The best way to filter them out is if anyone claims they can get you to the first page of Google in a few months they are a scammer because it doesn’t work that way. It takes time and lots of work to do it. We need to build authority with Google and have lots of content on our site that answers our customers questions and satisfies their searches. Or if you ask someone what they’d do for SEO work and you’re given a bunch if buzzwords that you never heard of before or understand, they’re a scammer. Real SEO people want you to know exactly what they’re doing, what it does, why it matters, and how it works. They don’t hide behind obscurity. They are open and thorough with a set plan and proven results form happy clients you can contact as a reference. When they ask me what my SEO guy does, I tell them this:

SEO consists of 2 parts - on page SEO and off page SEO. 

On page SEO are things you can do on the site itself. Like the design, content, load times, accessibility, blogging, etc. 

Off page are things you do off the site. Like building backlinks to your site; citations, social media, guest posting on blogs, etc. 

Together these comprise your SEO strategy. I am good at on page stuff like accessibility for screen readers and design and load times. My sites score 100/100 page speed score from google. Google likes my sites because they load instantly on mobile and we get extra ranking online because of it. My SEO partner Adam does the content, backlinks, curations, blogging, ads, etc. so my work in his hands makes a complete SEO strategy to regularly create relevant content about your services and building them efficiently so they load fast and make google happy. 

SEO is not a short term flip of a switch and your ranking front page. It takes 6-12 months to see the effects of good SEO strategy. It’s a long term investment. For short term gains you run google ads to show up in relevant searches at the top and get seen by your clients at the point they’re looking for your services. 

So SEO + ads + social media management is what makes a complete marketing strategy to maximize your reach online and be seen my as many customers online as possible. 

If you don’t have an SEO guy or a budget for my SEO guy, What I do is I do searches for my clients keywords in large city metro areas in a different state and open all the top ranking sites. I analyze the keywords they’re using and content, feed it into chatGPT and have it write new content based on that content from those pages and to pretend it’s a copywriter for websites. Then it gives me the content, I edit it to make it sound more human or change sentence structure, and add it to the site. I know what sections I need on a site and what order and what content I need and where to put the keywords. I do this for interior service pages called content silos as well. These content

> I went to law school so I could sue big companies and hold wrongdoers responsible for the injuries they cause. 

I love representing Plaintiffs who are really hurt. Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. 

If...

If only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. 

I had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. 

One quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. 

There are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  

In the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.

But oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. 

Then there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. 

When they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. 

Oddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. 

Your client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every

> Congrats on the new role! We work with a lot of small firms, and you’re definitely not alone, many still rely on manual timesheets until someone finally says, “there’s got to be a better way.”

What usually matters most for smaller practices is:

* *Simplicity* — if it takes more time to manage the software than the timesheet itself, it’s not worth it.
* *Accuracy* — missed or forgotten entries add up quickly, especially in a billable environment.
* Affordability — you don’t need a massive enterprise system to get solid results.  

At Billables AI, we focus on automating as much of the process as possible. Instead of manually logging, the software captures work in the background and organizes it into clear, ready-to-use time entries. That way, you’re not adding another administrative burden on top of your legal work.

The biggest “pro” we hear is that firms stop losing hours to memory gaps, and the main “con” is just the adjustment period—it feels strange at first to let software do the tracking for you. But once it clicks, the timesheet process becomes much smoother.

Happy to answer questions if you want specifics on how it might fit for a smaller firm setup.

> At the most basic level, the answer is simple: other firms are already implementing AI, and clients will notice if you’re not.

But the heart of your post seems to be: Why would I use AI when I can have a paralegal bill for the same work and make more money?

The short answer: because when your competitors stop charging two hours for something AI does in minutes, you’ll either start losing clients — or, worse, face serious complaints about your billing practices. And it’s not just a business risk — it’s also a reputational and ethical one. As AI becomes more capable, continuing to bill for tasks that could be automated starts to look like you’re padding hours.

This change is inevitable. Even if your clients aren’t pushing now, they will. There’s a short window where AI is still optional. Soon, it’ll be expected and you’ll be scrambling to catch up when clients start asking why your competition delivers the same result in half the time for less money.

As for upcharging: clients pay for value, not process. If AI lets you deliver better outcomes, faster, with fewer errors — you might justify premium pricing. But you’re not going to get away with charging for what’s clearly been automated busywork for too long.

> If your entire business depends on SEO, then simply don't do it. 

I have worked as a white-label SEO consultant with agencies in USA, and have ranked websites in PI/Car accident niches including locations like Las Vegas, New Orleans where CPC is 100$+, I will answer this based on my actual experience.   
  
SEO would only work if you have other active client accusation channels. Be it referrals, paid ads. I am saying this because SEO is momentum. No body can actually tell whether it will work for you or not till you spend a certain amount of time testing it. 

If you don't have other active channels, this will work as a double ended sword, you might not only loose significant money, you will loose time, which I feel is more valuable. 

First thing is to figure out how much it would cost to run PPC ads, and what is the cost per click in your niche. If this is within your reach, test it out by targeting keywords that are used by people desperately in need for a lawyer. Many times, PPC firms would go after broad terms just to inflate the reports and very little money is spend on keywords that would actually bring in desperate leads. 

Second thing is to find out if your website/landing page is built to convert. I have seen this on several projects where the website looks like a blog, and the service page content is nothing but huge chunk of texts that no body would read. Treat your service area pages as if you are spending 10k per month driving PPC ads to that single page with 50$ a click. This will change your perspective and you will start treating the page from users perspective.

Sadly, there is so much dream selling done in Legal niche by agencies, pushing backlinks as magic bullets to Lawyers just to justify the hefty retainers. 

I have worked with agencies who would hire us for 2k and flip it for 8-10k by adding bunch of articles and backlinks which in reality, won't move the needle.

We have ranked for car accident lawyer terms, competing with big legal firms with massive budgets just based on these 3 things:  
1. You need to reverse engineer what's working for the top 5 results and try to build a better page than them.  
By better page, I simply don't mean more content or backlinks, here I mean engagement. That's possibly the no #1 thing that has helped us achieve results. If people spend more time on your page than the competitors, Google has no other choice but to give you visibility.

2. Focus on user experience and design of your page. The goal is not to drive more traffic, but convert the traffic as well. This is sold by some fancy CRO terms, but in reality its more about common sense. We build wireframes for each page that we optimize and pass that on to the design team. They then build on them. 

3. Build authority for your core service area that can get you maximum business. If you are a PI lawyer and you try to build authority for everything under the scope of PI, you become a generalist. It's impossible for Google to give real e

> What would you do for a $600 case?  File an answer, appear in court, negotiate a settlement by phone/email?  How many hours of work for $600 )e.g 1.0 for answer, 0.2 email negotiation, etc..  Going to court can easily cost 3.5 hrs depending on how close you are to the court.  How many hours dyou put into a $600 case, on average.  When do you jack up the price?  Also, employer plan referral?  What’s that?


In NYS, for example, you can’t use a P.O. Box only, you must have a location that can receive service, like a reception desk.  This drives up cost, but you can find something like that for $100 per month, without actually using the offices onsite- they charge extra for that.  This may not be the case in other states.  

One simple way to stop clients from leaving reviews about not having an office, is simply to include on your business card, or your website “satellite office” and also “by appointment only, various locations depending on client.”  You can always elaborate when you actually talk with them, but put them on notice that you’ll counsel them remotely, or whatever better language you can use.  You can also reply on google by stating the same.  And do it so it makes sense and sounds good to the potential clients who are reading.

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

> A lot of different answers in this thread but I’ll give you my experience from working both plaintiff and defense in my jurisdiction…

The answer is yes, many people in the personal injury supply chain have a financial stake in lawyer referrals - first responders, towing companies, hospital / healthcare workers, union representatives, and so on. 

It used to be straightforward cash for referrals, now there’s less obvious ways it gets done to get around legal and ethical hurdles.  

For example- look into who is actually paying for many of the lawyer billboards in your area. In my jurisdiction, it’s not uncommon for law firm advertising to be paid for by unaffiliated “marketing companies” that are comprised by different stakeholders - chiropractors and other first-stop clinics typical.

Why would chiropractors and doctors pay to advertise for a law firm? Because when those medical providers refer the injured patient to their choice lawyers, those lawyers can negotiate to protect the liens (ie the medical bills) of those providers to make sure they’re paid as-billed. If your jurisdiction has a collateral source rule, bills generated by providers are typically 2-3x higher than what a normal insurance carrier would reimburse, so personal injury patients are much much more valuable to the medical provider than someone paying with Blue Cross, etc. 

Still, those providers need lawyers to take the cases and get them paid. So they establish relationships with firms and it’s understood between them that the providers will keep referring patients in exchange for the lawyers protecting their bills. 

Once the scale exceeds a certain point, it can make sense for providers to advertise (and pay for) lawyer advertising to increase the amount of referrals from the firm to the providers. 

People who defend this arrangement will say everybody wins - the doctors who provide treatment (often to poor/broke patients that can’t afford to pay themselves) get paid top dollar for their treatment, injured people are directed to lawyers who know ostensibly what they’re doing, and the lawyers get more cases. 

I’m not aware of disciplinary actions in my jurisdiction against this, but I am aware of firms doing it openly and obtaining their own ethics opinions/white papers that say this is kosher to use in the event the ethics board ever cracks down on this (which will never happen). 

There’s other examples as well - it’s not exactly bribery for a law firm to sponsor expensive events / make donations to certain unions with the understanding that the union reps will funnel workplace injuries back to that firm in return, for example. 

I’d be speculating on how your particular case with the auto shop would work, but it’s easy to imagine auto shops getting some financial benefit (indirectly or directly) for referring people to a certain firm. Heck, it probably wouldn’t even have to be a nefarious arrangement- law firms with clients who need auto work can send their clients to

> > I am constantly anxious, stressed out, and I find myself taking all of that home with me.

Learning how to regulate and process your emotions is the single best skill any lawyer can make. What you're finding is when the core problem is being dysregulated vis-a-vis stifling your emotions instead of processing them, then the cascading impacts they have follow you. I'm not suggesting this piece is mutually exclusive with the autonomy of running your own firm -- I think you can do it regardless and you can do it now.

* The resources that worked for me include the YT channel "therapy in a nut shell." She has 2 playlists. One is how to regulate and process emotions. The second is anxiety specifically. 
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXAr5dh23zU&list=PLiUrrIiqidTWje-Oc4uA6LZZO8vSaHaDL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXAr5dh23zU&list=PLiUrrIiqidTWje-Oc4uA6LZZO8vSaHaDL)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kucxlrh74sg&list=PLiUrrIiqidTVqab7pZivzb-e-tMA8qjd-

There's lots of other resources but these two helped. Here's sort of the synopsis. 

* Emotional regulation is a learned skill; many have been inadvertently taught to ignore/stifle/avoid emotions. 
* There's a biological cost/result if you stifle/avoid your emotions; it makes you physiologically more likely to be more anxious
* The solution is easy and very freeing

>So, I started wondering if maybe going solo was the answer

The logical part of me thinks that you're replacing one set of problems with another. But you're not reducing the problems. Being good at marketing (that is finding paying clients) isn't something that appeals to me personally so take my comment with that grain of salt. I think it's harder than it looks.

&#x200B;

>I’m hoping that someone might see this and will relate with their own experience. Anyways, thanks for reading this far.

I worked for a somewhat toxic firm, but I think my experience seems similar to my classmates. It's the "sink or swim" training methodology combined with the "up or out" so you're constantly proving yourself. There's no real job security so it was easy to give into the constant anxiety. 

I had learned a bit more about the physiological impacts -- and solutions to control -- anxiety for the bar exam. I pushed them away for the billable hour, but brought them back when I was just constantly inflammed and burnt out. 

On top of the anxiety lessons, I also learned that getting a productivity schedule also helped me feel a sense of control. I use pomodoro -- you basically block your time and do 1 task in that block. You do as much as you can and then you stop at the end of your timer. It takes a while to figure out how to chain them together and how to break up your assignments. But, you never miss an appointment on your calendar. So, using that logic, you can just knock out assignments that way. 

Then I also learned the huge impact and benefit of getting 8 hours of restful sleep. After controlling for medical issues (e.g., sleep apnea is

> I am a California paralegal who had my own business doing contract remote work for solo attorneys and small firms. The firms that sent me regular business, and were available to answer questions and provide clarification periodically were the ones that got my best work. If that attorney/firm really needed me in a bind I would stay up late, give up my Saturday and push through to get something to them when they needed it.  I never missed a deadline and they always raved about my work. Some firms wouldn't send me business for months then suddenly wanted me to do things last minute, wouldn't get back to me for days if I had a few simple clarifying questions which stopped me from being able to do any work at all.... I didn't make myself available for them. They didn't respect me as a fellow professional or even human. 

You get what you pay for and it's not just money that is used to pay people.  Good management is an important part of the compensation. Outsourcing paralegals can be real win win for everybody. It all comes from respect, decent pay and decent communications and realistic standards and goals.

> If you're looking at where the money is actually made (or lost), it usually comes down to two specific areas of friction: **Administrative Lag** and **Response Latency.**

# 1. Contract/SOW Generation (Eliminating the "Drafting" Tax)

Most agencies let deals go cold because it takes 48 hours to "get the paperwork together."

* **The ROI:** You can move from a "Discovery Call" to a "Signed SOW" in under 30 minutes.
* **The System:** Use a tool (like Fireflies) to record the call. That transcript is fed into an LLM with your SOW template. It extracts the deliverables, pricing, and timelines discussed and pushes them into a draft in your CRM. Client get one link to sign contract, pay invoice
* **Result:** You aren't "writing" anymore; you're just "approving/correcting." That saves roughly 2–4 hours of high-level management time per lead.
* Ditch the hyped "AI agent" build. Use workflows. You need automations that give you ROI, not burn money on maintenance. Use local hosted tools for 7 USD / month like n8n 

# 2. Omnichannel Speed-to-Lead (The 5-Minute Rule)

Data shows that if you don't respond within 5 minutes, your odds of qualifying a lead drop by **80%**. In 2026, leads are hitting you on IG DMs, WhatsApp, Email, and site bots simultaneously.

* **The ROI:** It’s impossible to staff a human on every channel 24/7. Automating the *initial* triage ensures no lead feels ignored.
* **The System:** Use an aggregator (like Manychat + n8n ) to pipe all channels into one "AI Dispatcher." The bot acknowledges the lead, answers basic FAQs based on your past data, and-most importantly-books the meeting.
* **Result:** You stop losing revenue to competitors who simply picked up the phone faster.
* Make the bot self learn, by providing it human feedback. each day, give it feedback for how it replied. Store these in a vector database. Next days, the bot will reply very close to what you just told it

# 3. High-Value "Intent" Scrapes

Forget bulk scraping. The real ROI is in **Event-Based Marketing.** \* **The System:** Set up a scraper to monitor local news or trade journals for specific triggers (e.g., a mall announcing a new renovation or a major tenant exit).

* **The Pitch:** Your outreach isn't "Hi, we do marketing." It’s "I saw you’re losing your anchor tenant in June; here is how we’ve helped other malls fill that footfall gap."
* **Result:** High-signal outreach that gets a 10x higher response rate than standard cold email.
* You ca read all the news, filter out your ideal ICP, with cheap scrapers from marketplaces like apify

> Sorry just been back through the questions and realised I missed this - answers below:

1. At the beginning we just did PPC, we then added SEO, and then Paid Social. At that time we had the channel people managing the client relationships directly rather than having Account Managers. That worked well because the client had direct access to the person delivering the work, but it stopped working when we got bigger and we had clients where we were delivering big complex campaigns. We then hired a team of Account Managers / Account Directors. Account Managers / Account Directors maybe managed 10 clients each, although that would involve a few large clients that took up lots of time and some other smaller clients that were more light touch.

2. Pricing was always based on what we needed to charge in order to make the business profitable, taking into account our staff and overheads. We obviously sense-checked this against what we knew competitors were charging, but since all agencies pay similar salaries and have similar overheads, we were always roughly in line with the market. Pricing increased as we grew in size and our overheads increased, plus we were benchmarking ourselves against different competitors.

3. Our tech stack was Salesforce for sales / CRM (also used Sales Navigator and Apollo for lead gen), [Funnel.io](http://Funnel.io) & Tableau for reporting, and then we built custom tools for time-tracking / campaign management / invoicing.

> I see a lot of opinionated debate here, so I'm gonna jump in with some hard data, because the numbers actually support both of your stances to some extent.

For reference, we've run cold email for ourselves as well as dozens of clients over the past few years (some industry leading brands). At our peak, we were sending about 100k cold emails/month per client.

It is a canonical FACT that, over the last 5-10 years, cold email has experienced:

1. Increasing saturation
2. Decreasing ROI

We measured our **MSMB (Messages Sent to Meeting Booked)** rate over the past 5 years. The reason we use this as a north star metric is that, if you know your:

1. Sending Costs  
2. Close Rate  
3. LTV

you can easily calculate your overall ROI using your MSMB.

(Side note: Reply rate and open rate are vanity metrics. Anyone flexing a "high reply rate" usually doesn't know what they're talking about, in the same way that a media buyer flexing CPC over ROAS is likely inexperienced).

Over the past 5 years, MSMB has steadily worsened with the following trajectory:

* **2021 and before:** Avg \~50 emails to book 1 meeting.
* **2022:** Avg \~150 emails.
* **Early 2023:** Avg \~300.
* **Late 2023:** Avg \~1,000.
* **Early 2024:** Avg \~3,000.
* **Late 2024 and after:** Range 2,500 - Infinity. (We literally had clients send 25k emails with zero bookings).

So, if your cold outbound system has:

1. The ability to send massive volume for a low cost
2. A large TAM (total addressable market)
3. A completely untapped product-market fit

You can still make it work in 2025. The reality, however, is that fewer than 1/10 businesses have this right now.

We actually had clients profitably spending $50k+/month on Facebook ads who couldn't get a single booked meeting after 25,000+ cold emails.

Given the decreasing trust from sophisticated B2B prospects, we stopped fighting the inbox and started optimizing for Answer Engines/LLMs.

Internally, we call this building a "Semantic Trust Graph."

Basically, the goal is to structure data across high-authority nodes (Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, YouTube, etc) so that when a user asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a vendor, our clients are the cited answer.

And, given how the LLMs are now, you can actually start ranking within just a couple weeks (good for the new guys).

So yeah, cold email isn't 100% useless, but unless you have unicorn-like product-market fit in a totally unsaturated industry, it’s becoming like having a billboard in the desert.

> I think it mainly depends on what you and your team actually NEED, and what you need the software to do. I have worked in many industries that are very disconnected with little overlap, but almost every single business activity boils down to CRUD: you need a database you can Create, Read, Update and Delete from. Virtually every program and game, etc.; that we use is some kind of abstraction of an "interactive table(s)". For 20+ years I have always had the same job, roughly (outside my forays into other weird work), and that is essentially "make a highly specific and proprietary CRUD".

Customers? Appointments? Installs? Leads? These are all just tables of data and the interplay between them is what can give projects life. Obviously, this is not something you can just whip out if you do not have the skill set which is okay, I am just explaining this in the hopes that maybe you can look at your own processes and see what exactly you need.

The thing that I feel is really insidious about stuff like GHL is when it is also sold as being able to generate leads/sales or do proper lead nurturing. In both cases, they require more resources to get dumped in (advertising dollars in the first, and proper workflows/automations in the second). It isn't that you can't use GHL in any capacity: just that you would light-years ahead of most of your competition if you properly knew what it was and what it was **not** capable of, coupled with what exactly your team needs on a day-to-day basis.

There are also lots of alternatives and that SaaS space is absolutely flooded with options. Invariably, they will all have some shortcomings. Their own pros and cons. Some employees will want (Software Y) they used at their last company and not (Software X) that you end up choosing, which is also inevitable, so it is important to avoid a secondary trap of constantly searching for a solution and thinking that, just beyond the horizon, an oasis awaits. It is always a mirage.

I look at the process (in solar) like this: you have or generate a lead that is interested -> an appointment setter or the sales rep directly gets in contact with them virtually or ideally at their house -> management tracks these interactions very granular to watch for hiccups -> hopefully the deal converts (customer signs) and heads to your installer or you do the install and continue down the process further with customer retention/service, etc.;

The hardest part is the first step. You might end up having to dump a lot of uneasy money into various marketing. The internet does not operate the same way it did even a year ago: SEO got massively disrupted by AI, for example, and advertisements in **any** industry can be a crapshoot (even with highly skilled marketing teams and near limitless budgets). 

This whole process can be done on a spreadsheet and a lot of companies end up there, with mountains of spreadsheets everywhere (which doesn't scale very well and can be terrifying from a security standpoint

> There are a few schools of thought on finding out, or not finding out the budget. In a way, the price is the price regardless of how much they have to pay for it. On the other hand, if you want or need the work then you will likely be willing to fit your price into whatever constraints they put on you. Some people have strong arguments on one way of thinking about their budget or the other. Personally, if I can get the budget then I prefer to know the budget. 

So, if you haven't already, ask what them for the budget. There's nothing wrong with asking, and if you don't then you're flying blind. I sometimes use that analogy if someone wants a car, you need to know some details before you can point them in the right direction. New or used, low end or high end, features, etc. A car will get you there and back, but it could be a used Kia or a top in lambo. Apply that example to their project, a Shopify is not like all others, right? What will their budget allow in terms of bells, whistles, options, training, etc? If they have a small budget, you'll propose just the basics. If they have a large budget then you'll give them everything. 

Ask to speak to the client. If the design company won't allow it then it's a huge red flag. I long ago stopped working for intermediaries. It never worked out because you're answering to multiple parties, and in the end your client's client, who you don't have contact with, is the decision maker. That's a terrible situation to be in. And also, the intermediary can unilaterally cut you out whenever they want. You want contact, and a contract, with the end-client. If you can't get that and you still want to pursue the deal then you have risk that you should account for in your pricing. 

I like the idea of pricing in a set number of hours for support and training. Even better, be explicit about how many hours and what they get when you write your proposal and contract. Be sure to include in your proposal what your rate is for additional support and training, as well as for change orders. (they always want changes)

RE: bumping your cost to come up with the price. Are you adding any value to the project? Are you providing project management, scope management, communications, training, funding (you pay your dev before you get paid), etc? If so, include your time and liabilities in addition to the markup on your outsourced costs. Don't forget to pay yourself!

Before marking up the price, be sure to identify and quantify the risks of the project. The more risks you can account for, the better. So instead of arbitrarily slapping 40% on the developer's cost, first ensure that all your risks are accounted for in the price, then mark up on top of that for your profit. Shoot, 40% may be too low of a number. Where did you come up with that? Personally, I prefer to 2x to 3x my outsource direct costs because I have a shit ton of other expenses to account for besides just the COGS. 

Even better is to not price based on your cost. I

> I had good luck with my 1-man software MVP factory last year - was able to spin up some super impressive MVPs for a ton of clients (from clean tech startups to international peace keeping orgs) using new tech stacks such as TailwindUI, Supabase, Next.js, and APIs in Node.js or Python/FastAPI. 

Having GPT/Phind.com searching documentation for me and helping me to answer (easy!) tasks, especially around backend tasks, kept things fast. Could churn out 1 MVP a month easy, 2 at a deadly push.

Got to $19k MRR pretty quickly, and knowing the budgets in the US for MVPs with this tech stack, was aware it could have got to $100k MRR if I was a little wiser. I had very strong contracts with the clients I built MVPs for - but got completely shafted by 1 partnership agreement in particular that I signed, when I began working as the Fractional CTO for other agencies. 6 months of friendly fire caused me to stop customer acquisition, wind down to just 1 client on retainer, and pause to think.

Fixed price and fixed scope are great - especially when you have a tool to sort it out for you (I built my own tool for this, which works wonders. Basically an automated contract negotiator!) However the other piece needs is to have an efficient, zero-time solution around QA/testing - to validate that your fixed scope work is completed. 

1 unreasonable (generally non-technical, without budget) client that one of your partner agencies lets in - especially if they’re buddies - can run amok with what seems like a reasonable partnership agreement. 

Having end-to-end testing scripts to hand that can confirm - for 99% of users - that the terms of the contract has been met, and the current wishlist is for backlog/maintenancd given the scope of an MVP (keep defining and reiterating this, repeatedly) - is critical. Best to write them yourself - but as a quick extension, would also consider using the service over at octomind.dev for quick AI E2E testing. They’re still very much WIP, but if I pile fuel on the fire in the future, they’ll like be ready at that time!

Or just dictate terms in any partnership agreement upfront. Or just own all of the client relationships yourself, and aggressively refund and terminate any clients that show a slew of red flags.

> Greetings,  
Firstly, I want to thank you, not many people are willing to help me there, but let's get straight into it.  
My offer is running Meta & Twitter ads with a guarantee of money back.  
My niche is Health & Beauty. I mainly reach out to plastic surgery, dental clinics, and skincare brands.  Planning on either trying the martial arts equipment or the insurance nieche.   
Is any of these a good idea? Should I ditch them all and think of a new one? If yes, have you got any idea?  
My outreach methods -  
Sending an email to a brand, ( Have 4 templates they will be included down below ) and wait for an answer. I've seen that you recommended that I shouldn't use my domain email, so I do 50% domain and 50% Gmail. Wait 2-3 weeks and message the brand on Instagram. ( I will try to reach the owners now that you recommended too ). I have sent out about 550 cold emails now, but I got about 5 responses and none of them wanted to go through with anything. I have messaged about 400 brands on Instagram, and the results are way better there. About 1 in 25 brands are interested in my proposition, but after I explain it to them, they just stop answering. This is the furthest I got in half a year.  
I would try cold calling, but that isn't really an option for me. Where I live, it is insanely expensive to call numbers in the US and the UK.  
I also post on Instagram, would you mind checking it? @ kaloroadvertising  
I use snov.io, Hunter, and Anymailfinder to find emails. A lot of times I can only find info, support, etc. kind of mail. Should I even message those emails? Is there any point of that?  
This is everything I have for now. I know it is a lot, but I would be really grateful if you could help me with any of these.  
If you think I should do some other kind of outreach, please let me know!  
Here are the templates, please tell me what can I improve!  
Subject Lines: sometimes insert x!4 or their name before the lines  
"Change this ASAP" "This has to change" "Hello xxx" "You have to change this" "You NEED this"   
A,  
I’m not going to lie, your creatives are wonderful.  
I absolutely love them.  
While I was on your website, I noticed you have Pixel installed and you run ads too.  
I went ahead and checked them.  
I will be honest with you, I have seen a bunch of mistakes.  
You’re losing out on a bunch of money and brand awareness by not marketing properly.

> It'll try answer both your questions with a model we now use.

Tracking time and trying to achieve a maximum billable rate per head count is where most agencies start. However, soon it becomes a trap for managers. Focusing only at these two metrics (billable hours &amp; utilisation rates) limits the agency to increase its annual revenue. Because if the agency wants to increase its revenue, it has to increase headcount (to have more billable hours to sell to clients) - which is not always sustainable as you may not be able to control the work (i.e., clients may slow down spend etc.).

In the first 7 years of my agency, billable time and utilisation was a focus - we initially targeted 90% and quickly realised that wouldn't work (for reasons you have mentioned). We then targeted 80% per production headcount (6 hours per day) with a view to have 60% utilised across all productions staff on average.  In this model, timesheets was still key and it is important to remember that you can't simply KPI/performance manage staff on achieving 6 billable hours a day if they have no control in selling work to clients. Our Account / Strategy team focused on revenue (sale of hours), and our production team focus on delivery (utilisation and quality). For projects, we created detailed scope documentation (pages and pages of functional spec - which the client rarely read in full), granular estimates for each task, and fixed plans to a deadline date - all of which caused tension each time client wanted to make a minor change.

Fast forward to last year, and we abandoned timesheets altogether. We also stopped tracking billable hours per staff (however, we still track utilisation rates). Now, the engagement is done using sprints (2 week cycle) where we look at the project objectives, features, stories, and do rough point estimation to say "We believe to achieve the project MVP requirement, it will take 6 sprints with 4 resources in each sprint". Clients have flexibility to adjust priorities of scope and we do frequent releases to showcase work (which client love seeing progress every 2 weeks). Our Project Management team use a resource/capacity booking system to track utilisation of staff against projects. This model increased utilisation, motivation and helped the team focus on a single large project. In between big projects, the production team may go to a BAU (business as usual) bench to help with small bits of work for other clients - all of which still uses a 2 week sprint cycles to manage.

From a revenue point of view, our Account / Strategy team focused on maximising utilisation  and we have a revenue target per month/quarter/year. But it also has its revenue limitations - as again, you're selling total headcount capacity in a sprint fashion. Last year we started moving our pricing model towards value based pricing. Rather than charging an hourly rate or per headcount per sprint rate, we analyse what value a project creates for our clients (in collaboration wit

> I get this. I think the doubt is less about your capability and more about how the last 12 months have been set up to eat your confidence alive. You were asked to run without a harness: no training, poor marketing, zero budget, and the expectation that you both deliver and invent a repeatable GTM overnight. That will hollow anyone out.

A few practical things I would do, nothing dramatic, just work you can start today that rebuilds momentum and gives you something concrete to show:

Start with stories. Pick 3 client wins that actually mattered (renewals, cross-sells, a programme you rescued, a C-suite relationship that led to new work). For each: name the situation, what you did (not the team fluff), the measurable result ($$ value, % increase, retention uplift, timeline saved), and one short line about how you made it repeatable or scalable. These become interview answers, LinkedIn posts, and CV bullets, and they force you to see real impact instead of the fog of “I did a lot.”

You say you have always hit target. That’s gold. Turn it into structure: average deal size, sales cycle length, conversion rate from intro to win, number of accounts you reactivated, pipeline you owned at any point. Even rough numbers are useful. Hiring managers for BD roles want patterns not magic.

Build a 30–60–90 for a Head-of-BD role before you get the job. In interviews, present a concrete plan: how you would fix pipeline, what one process you’d change in 30 days, which hires you’d prioritise, a hypothesis for where to find quick early market wins. This shows you are already operating like a leader and not someone desperate to escape fee work.

Use your network like a market test. Tell three trusted clients and peers you are exploring leadership roles and ask two tactical questions: “If you were hiring a Head of BD, what woul you value most?” and “Who in your network should I speak with?” Those answers will both sharpen your pitch and surface warm intros.

Start a short, public signal: a 1–2 page one-pager on a sales play you ran or a client case study you own. Post a thoughtful LinkedIn note on a lesson learned (real and specific). The point is to create evidence you can point to when you feel the imposter voice.

Finally, practice the language of leadership! Move from “I sold this” to “I built the motion that produced X.” Leaders close deals and design repeatable systems. You already have the raw material (delivery credibility + client relationships). Frame it as system design and you stop sounding like a good seller and start sounding like someone who can scale a sales organisation.

IMO, you are closer than you think. The last year chewed up your confidence, but not your skill. If it helps, I touch on this exact transition (from being the rainmaker to building the machine) in [Beyond Slides](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr). Mostly because I saw so many people who could sell but struggled to sell themselves into leadership roles...

You have done the hardest bit: kept

> Good sales people always assume the sale. 

So the approach is to stay in the conversation and provide value for the things that can be answered quickly, which lets you show your quality and expertise. Deepen the conversation until it's clear that going further would require solving nuanced stuff, then the stage is set for asking to continue as a formal project.

Some comments here are going to be slightly off because of framing it as "sorry," like talking shop is offensive; or framing it passively like "I'd be happy to take that as a project," which is fine but it also sounds like you've stopped the conversation because you think there's a disconnect.

The approach is to assume they are asking you to help them. Because you have the ability to deliver, and they need this, so why wouldn't they want to generate value? To frame the mentality, think of when you stop for a refreshment in the summer, the vendor doesn't reply with sorry or "I'd be happy to help." They just assume you want a refreshment and talk to you like it's simply about figuring out what product to give you to best serve you. So you want to get into the conversation with a positive attitude and give value, and drive that conversation to the point that it feels like they clearly would benefit from a more dedicated effort and it's time to get more nuanced.

A lot of times, consultants fear if they say something savvy in a few minutes then the value they provide is gone. If all you have to give can be absorbed in a single conversation, whatever you were selling wasn't worth much anyway. IMO, be generous with giving value in conversation, because it amounts to very little without a proper process, and all it really does is position you better as a source of solutions and expertise. The vibe is: if I can blow your mind with a couple ideas in a 15 min conversation, imagine what I can do if you hire me to really get into this for you. So go ahead and blow their mind in a quick chat.

Here is a run that is closer to the bullseye:

"Yes, that's very interesting because we've been working on a similar project in the last few months and we ran into many of the same issues you are experiencing. We've worked out a few angles that are very useful and we are finding great progress, but it depends on various factors that we'd need to uncover further. I think pursuing this would be very meaningful for your organization. If you are ready to explore it further now, I can put together a project plan for us to work on this. It's going to be great."

Always Be Closing. Provide value, show unique expertise, show the complexity of the project, be excited about the project, confirm how valuable it is for them; once they are optimistic, assume the sale and ask for involvement.

If you give a bit of value away and there's no sale, you haven't lost anything, not even time. It's a marketing and sales investment. The process builds bridges and plants seeds. Someone that just wanted a quick help today might come

> What happens if you stop working? Can you and your medical profession husband survive on one income and have the family you want? 

That's the super worst case scenario. Less financially bad scenarios are: maybe you're out of work for a year or two because you're laid off and the job search is hard. Maybe you take a lower paying job than your current role. Etc. Same question about these scenarios - can you guys make it work financially?

If the answer is "yes," then you're free. Work doesn't matter except for however much you want to care about the relationships with coworkers and pride in your work. Only you can decide how much to value those, but the first step is taking a step back and realize that you're probably not as shackled to the corporate world as you realize

Obviously I'm making a lot of assumptions about your financial situation which includes a lot of privilege that many of us have capitalized on, so if you're in a less fortunate situation, at least you can recognize that you gotta be in it for your family and use that to self motivate

So now their technology is a Frankenstein monster of smaller solutions, and duct taped together. This makes proper implementations from a data engineering side near impossible, and as a result you get a very frustrating experience. That is further inhibited by the fact they place all their money into Marketing and not actually improving the product, product improvements are actually a cost center essentially as just having a feature is enough. The people who sign the contracts dont actually use the tool and just make product comparisons based on feature sets.

> I’ll try to give you a more direct answer. It’s hard to explain because we can do a lot of different shit, and with that we are not experts in anything.

Management consultants usually help companies understand where they are good at, where their customers see them adding value, how they compare against competitors, and where they can actually make money. In theory this should be the CEO’s job, but a lot of management teams are very narrow minded and can’t see outside of their own four walls. Lots of companies are still spending money on products that are losers because “that’s what we do”.

The way we do it is we look at a shit ton of market reports, talk to an immense amount of clients, competitors, industry experts and their own employees to try to understand market size and customer needs. After that we tell them where we think they should be and how we think they should approach the market, and if they do it right, which they not always do, we estimate how much money they can make. We also tell them where they are bad and should stop trying to invest. We talk a lot one because some consultants are only good at talking, but for every management consultant that talks a lot there is a larger number of consultants that actually do a lot of work. And clients talk a lot too, especially senior leaders, and ultimately every business’ goal is to make their clients happy. 

This is true for a strategy case, but other cases are pretty similar. Basically telling them what they are doing now and they should stop, and what they’re not doing now and should start doing.

Technical folks have a hard time understanding this because there is no clear deliverable, and unless they implement our recommendations the company will not be better off after we leave then they were when we came in. Strategic changes take time. 

For contrast, let’s say you’re an IT consultant doing SAP implementation. Yeah it feels great to finish the work with something to show, but after you’re done you don’t know if the client is going to use the right way, or if spending millions to get SAP was even the right thing to do. All you know is that the system is there and it’s working. Management consultants are there to answer the more conceptual questions.

He just want to know how much money he can make in Asia, give or take 40%, and he wants the answer by the end of the week. So in practice, the average expert is a 50-something middle manager. A bit like my colleagues.

> It’s such a mischaracterization. Scapegoats are honestly meaningless especially for public companies.  Do you think the Board gives out a “get out of jail free card” because McKinsey was behind a failed strategy?  They do not - the buck stops with management no matter who they might bring in to advise them. 

And a copy paste from a prior response…

 But to be honest, I strongly believe the majority of consulting work does generate value for clients. Consulting didn't become a $1T global industry by accident. Noting that you're at a boutique, and there is often a very high variability in that long tail, you might want to consider other opportunities that fit better for you.

Here's something I wrote the last time "value" in consulting (specifically MBB) was brought up:

============

Three areas come to mind where we have the most bang for our buck for our clients:

strategy

breaking new ground

organizational change

Strategy - In my opinion, the company's strategic choice - who we are - is the most important decision. When you're big enough, the risk of getting it wrong is astronomical - the cost of consultants pales in comparison. Where consultants bring value is through the an independent perspective of the holistic competitive space today, where it's going, and where the white space is. While the internal people may be talented and knowledgeable about their company, they lack the broader view that a Firm who works across an industry can bring. If I were a Chief Strategy Officer, I'd have the internal team working on a strategy and the consultants creating their own take free from insider influence. Then, bring the two together to blend the best of both worlds.

Breaking new ground - If I were running a business and looking to enter into an area I was not familiar with - whether that be industry or function - a consultancy's perspective would be valuable. They would be able to bring the latest thinking, best practices, and optimized processes that would take us much longer to develop, acquire, or hire on our own. I would not hire us if the new opportunity is a clear adjacency to the core business. To put it in real-world terms, if I were Amazon trying to improve customer engagement via mobile, hiring a consultant would not be on my short list of things to focus on. But if I were Aetna or Sysco, then it could make a lot more sense. Even more so if a company is looking to make moves into new markets or diversified acquisitions.

Organizational change - I'm not using "organizational change" in the way I usually would in this context, but what I'm trying to get at is things like transformation or operational effectiveness that represent a meaningful change for the company. Like strategy, these are typically areas where best practices are helpful and downside risk to the organization is large. The difference is that, as a client, I likely know what the high-level answer is - e.g., cut costs by x%, fix the marketing department, or merge two LOBs.

> >Ultimately, this is a relationship business.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Even if I were just doing implementations, I'd still want to stop in every now and then to show the flag, let them know we're here to help, and hear their concerns.

The rationale I've always been given is 'it's easier to justify billability'. Here's the thing too, I used to believe this exactly before COVID, then COVID demonstrated to me how completely invalid this all was. I've never had an issue billing a client for the same exact initiatives for the same amount of allotted hours whether on-site or not. Not sure if the billing structure is much different in strategy, but at least in most implementations I've done — much of it is already pre-planned, and if directors are somehow not aware of this — then that's just shockingly ignorant of them. 

My issue with this rhetoric is when you have older directors/executives who have rose-tinted glasses on and are out of touch with what actually drives value. I'm not against all travel (I think based on the projects I've done, maybe 1-2 weeks of travel per given implementation \[can take about 3-4 months\] is more than sufficient), but ultimately there are still consulting firms/arms that are still trying to push back to pre-COVID level travels, which is just moronic imho (particularly for something that isn't strategy based).

I genuinely do not see how this helps anyone. You end up burning out your consulting staff on non-value add related work (i.e. travel fatigue — a person is objectively worse cognitively traveling than not, just look up studies of sleeping in foreign environments), and many of them will oftentimes just find another role with less travel. OR, you end up just having your client blow more money on travel expenditures that didn't need to occur. Doesn't matter as much with enterprise accounts, but with lower-budget non-enterprise accounts? I think they'd definitely appreciate not spending 5-10k to fly me and X number of other consultants out just so I can point out to them a flag that needs to be flipped in the config — when the same exact outcome could have been achieved with far less effort or costs over a zoom meeting. 

Maybe this is a critique of my own product knowledge, but if a complex inquiry is asked of me (in which I don't immediately know the answer), it's a lot easier for me to find a solution faster when I can reference notes on a separate monitor instead of taking it away as an action item to be addressed later.

&#x200B;

IMHO, the people here who complain about WFH and reduced travel requirements should really take a step back and actually look at what drives the bottom line/revenue generation of their role and the associated fatigue with everything you do work-related. If something is fatiguing (very broad usage of this term mind you) but doesn't actually produce anything (especially something you can bill against), I think of it as a NVA generally.

> Look on youtube into FreePBX which is a UI on top of Asterisk, or FusionPBX which is a UI on top of Freeswitch. Both can work really well. It requires a little bit of a mind and understanding of telephone systems of old to configure but once you are used to it it makes sense. 

For example back in the day I did implement a few Lucent/AT&T systems and Meridian. The principles are still the same. They would allow you to for example have a numberplan like:

0 - reception / operator (if necessary at all)  
1000 series you could use for teams for example if necessary  
2001 hey that is your extension :P   
2002 co-worker 1  
2003 co-worker 2  
etc...

Then have something like   
3001 A hunt or ring group for like your main external number, which rings all of the 2000 series extensions that you added to the group, but if no answer you can continue to...

4001 The mailbox for teh hunt ring group or your main public telephone number...

And then you can get fancy and have like dial a 9 for an outside line, and also have internal calls...

On top of that you'd need to get a SIP trunk, a gateway. There are many providers, mine costs me €3 and then I have a local number and a geographic national number which are like €3 each. Plus the server to host costs like €9. And you are good for quite a few people.

Then for your extensions you can just have a SIP client on your desktop, and your mobile phone. The mobile phone ones need a push service and thus often come with a small subscription fee. But like zoiper can be as little as €0.99 per month.

Good luck :)

> Hi! I'm looking to see if anyone knows of a solution to my dilemma. Google has not been very helpful in answering this question.

I  currently use Microsoft Teams + Direct Routing at my business. This solution is cost-effective compared to many of the options out there for a business VoIP system. It works great when the user is on a wi-fi connection but has severe problems out in the field on a cellular data connection.

I was just recently testing a scheduling/job management product where the voice solution they offer is essentially a middleman. Within the app, you select the phone number you want to call, but the VoIP system actually calls you first before connecting with the call recipient. The VoIP system creates a three-way call with the user and recipient.

The software overall doesn't quite work for us, but I'm hoping there may be an alternative that can alleviate my cellular problem. Does anyone know of other systems that handle VoIP calls this way or that have an option?

&#x200B;

TL;DR:  VoIP phone system built into field service management software first calls the user and then connects the user with the recipient over cellular. It is a three-way call with the VoIP system. Alternatives?

> There is a actually a way to do this somewhat effectively. When email spam was a huge problem, some smart people had the same idea to catch spammers (ie. large trap banks). These are called spamtraps, and the techniques that have been used to make these can be used to make phone spam traps too. I would recommend reading the following articles, which have some good information on what you should try: [article1](https://wordtothewise.com/2011/08/a-brief-guide-to-spamtraps/), [article2](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/spamtraps-creating-and-seeding/), [article3](https://serverfault.com/questions/317876/how-can-i-attract-more-spammers-hitting-my-spam-traps). Generally however, the process is relatively simple:

1) Acquire a large number of phone numbers. Like a F\*\*\* load. (100-1000, depending on your budget. More is always better.) I recommend using BulkVS. I have had no problems with them before, and their rates are quite good.

2) Terminate all of these into a PBX of some kind. I think that a basic asterisk or freeswitch setup would work well. You can configure the PBX to send these to one or multiple phones depending on how many researchers you have available. You should also enable recording, CDR storage, CNAM lookups, and verbose logging on your PBX box, as this will give you some interesting information about the callers. If you don't know how to do this, I would recommend researching this, or getting someone who can. A proper spam harvesting setup should generate way more spam calls than a single person can handle. You'll also want the additional data that comes from running your own sip server.

3) Wait for calls to start coming in. You'll see that some numbers are "busy" and some aren't. Keep track of which ones are witch. Most importantly, ANSWER EVERY CALL. If you can't, ensure that voicemail is set up and works. ANSWER EVERY MESSAGE. You may even want to set up a webhook to auto reply to spam texts. Getting spam calls is like making money. The more you have, the easier it is to get more. Spammers sell lists of valid numbers to other spammers, and their computers detect answering machines and other features usually found on live numbers. When they see that you're answering and responding to their calls, they will add you to their gold lists, and you'll be getting dozens of calls a day soon enough. On the other hand, if the computer detects the three error tones usually found with an invalid number, or hears a phone error message, it will automatically scrub you from their list.

4) Make a list of the numbers that are bone-dry (Less than one call every other day). These numbers likely aren't on any list yet, so you're going to need to give them a kick-start. Start following the seeding techniques listed on the articles above, or devise some of your own. Get these phone numbers out there on social media, on public websites, on lists generally. Use them to sign up for shady services with other companies. Use them to sign up for

> **Niche Focus**

As for the real estate niche, I'm not a fan. First, it’s too broad. Are you talking about residential or commercial? Are you targeting agents, brokers, SaaS companies serving the industry, or something else?

I assume you really mean residential real estate agents. If so, here are some red flags...

* Most agents are solo operators. In other words, they pay out of their own pocket and their pockets are quite shallow.
* They are reluctant to spend money on marketing tools, especially if their brokerage already provides some, like most brokerages do.
* The majority of agents are unsuccessful and close very few deals per year, if any. 
* You will ride the ups and downs of the industry when things like demand for real estate and interest rates change. In other words, you'll have hard times ahead of you when people aren't buying real estate. This cycle is 100% out of your control. You're not recession-proof at all.

If you’re committed to this niche, I'd be very clear and intentional about who is your ideal prospect. Answer questions like...

* Residential or commercial?
* How many properties do they sell each year?
* What is their average deal size or total volume?
* How much do they need to make annually?
* Which geographic markets will you target (e.g., all of the U.S. or New York City)?

Get specific, then figure out where those people spend time and what they need. Make sure your services match their business goals.

Just a few thoughts. I hope this helps.

> This was run on a digital tv streaming service and generated 9 million customer leads…. So when you say more people look at social media i am not sure what your point is. The point of advertising is lead capturing. Their cost per lead ended up being $.01 per 125 leads. 

Comparing apples to tacos doesn’t make either less of a meal. You won’t get a CPL that low on any social platform ever. The only social media ads i have seen that have generated 1/1000th of the amount of leads cost quite a bit. 

You don’t see good ads on social media because people realized home made = looks like content and gets higher watches and engagement. So running TV level commercials on Social Platforms isn’t always a strategy that performs. When was the last time you saw an advertisement on social and stopped knowing it was a commercial and watched it? If your answer is all the time you should really ask others this to see if you still believe your idea is strong enough to build a business around.

> Thank you, I actually appreciate blunt answers, especially when it comes to work & business!

All of this is super solid insight, makes things much clearer for me.

Here's where I am confused now, was also discussing something similar in another comment thread on here and that person helped quite a bit as well:

I have a very healthy chunk of experience related to filmmaking. Albeit it's a lot of pre-production & production experience but not shy from video editing. For SOME reason, I was thinking I should leave filmmaking aside just as a hobby (because it's mostly for passion purposes), and dive into Digital Marketing from scratch. But after listening to some advice, that wouldn't be smart. I should do something video related. I absolutely do not want to provide on-site/hybrid services because that would mean my physical presence (hence, locally). Relative to a layperson, I am 9/10 in video editing, but when compared to experienced short form editors, I'm probably a 4. But I can learn and speed up my workflow very quickly, as I'm already familiar with the softwares. Only thing that is holding me back is my confusion on what to do and a slow laptop (can always sell some shit).

So the two paths I see could be:  
1. I can either get a \~$110-220/m job as an associate or whatever entry position in an agency & get some marketing experience. Build a portfolio and start my own thing.

2. Or I can polish up my video editing skills and get an $800-1700/m video editing remote job, will miss out on marketing & PPC/CPC ads experience though, but maybe I can figure that out later?   
  
This is where I'm stuck, should I start by providing the video editing services, have a client or two, build their trust, increase my market reputation/referrals/testimonials - and then gradually shift to Paid Video Ad Campaigns? Having learned how to run such ads using online resources/material.

I eventually want to go down the path of Direct Response Ads and similar marketing services that have a clear measurable ROI (in the form of ROAS etc), I reckon it keeps things simple when it comes to revenue growth.

> Any money spent on HR is less money available to pay overhead or salary for those employees.
If it's a small main street type restaurant, deli business usually they don't have much, or don't like to spend on labor. 
Think about the conversation with a business owner. How would you sell? What would be the reply from the business owner.

In my previous life, I managed a gas station, c store, rental apartments, etc. Revenue around 5mil annually. Paying employees decent wage or hiring adequate help was always an uphill battle. I had a board that I answered regarding operations. The board, or a business owner, refused to acknowledge how spending money on training, paying above the market, and better benefits would attract the best talent from neighboring businesses. 

This will allow us to form a team of memebers who are the best in what they do. Simple correct, you see the point. I see it. Everyone on this sub will also agree with what I wrote. But the board of partners, or in your case, a business owner refused to see value in hiring enough help or employing the best talent. I could not make them see it. Or they saw it but didn't agree with the benefit it provided compared to cost.

The conversation went like this.
Me - If we pay the best dollars we will attract the best talent and employees. Our customer service will go up, less turnover, also by attracting the best employees you are leaving other businesses at a disadvantage. Their employees will be second in competition. Look around us, all fortune 500 always assemble an awesome team. It's the bedrock of a successful business. You pay me top dollars and reap the rewards. We post increasing profit year after year. You give me amazing reviews. If we raise our comp by 20 percent, you can have a team that matches my work ethic and skill. Driven to make this business a success.

Answer- How will we measure that. Paying more doesn't guarantee the best employee. People come for the lowest gas price, good cook and food. They don't come here for cashier. We are happy with our profit now. It has worked like this for years. 

I left after failing to assemble a team that I wished. Having one or two great employees and the rest who have no interest in working for you leaves all the work and responsibility on those two employees. Takes the fun and your passion out. The team doesn't share your passion or care for the success of business.

So I quit. Now, I am in public accounting. Surrounded by talented people. Amazing mentors and coaches. I tried to build this in my existing job. Replicate this model for a small business. Just like you, I envisioned the benefit of mimicking strategies of Fortune 500 for small businesses and failed to let the owners see my vision. 

I hope you succeed. My advice is that small businesses are always run with short term view in mind, scarcity mentality no matter how profitable you are. The business owner does not plan for 5 or 10 years down the road. The business owner doesn't bel

You run a $1B company. You want up grow it to $3B in the next 5 years.

You’ve been successful addressing the needs of local market (small) businesses and grown quite a lot through acquisition of small businesses in your industry 

You are now a national business but your M&A practices, go to market approach and sales ops are all geared to serve local businesses.

Your geo business units act as fiefdoms with their own analytics, reporting… hell, maybe even pricing (think business services provider)

Your entire leadership team grew up in this construct

You know other companies do it better and you know there’s no way you grow to $3B by brining on loads more small businesses

You need large, national accounts that are served nationally and that you can cross sell

> Hi,

I’ve just recently had a thought that I might be missing out on a lot of income by not working as a consultant and being employed at my company. Some background: I have a MSc in business and computer science and spent the first 3 years of my career at a Big 4 firm working within Enterprise Risk. For the last 2 years, I’ve been working at a huge global security company, and have been responsible for the implementation of a new GRC & Privacy tool called OneTrust. Despite my relative young age, I have a very senior role as I have to liase with key stakeholders across the firm to establish their processes in the new mutual GRC & Privacy system.

Anyways, as with most things, once you’ve been working in the same area/system for a while, you become very good and efficient at it. My work here is almost done as I’ve managed to launch processes for almost all of our key functions across the world to use OneTrust. During a meeting with our Customer Success Manager at OneTrust, they also invited their other customer companies in my region in Europe. Due to OneTrust having been a relatively small player in the market (ServiceNow for example is much more common) I was shocked to see just how many companies actually used their services. Almost all of the questions these employers from various companies had were things I knew the answers to from experience, and quite frankly, I had better knowledge of the system than the OneTrust representative themselves.

It struck me that, despite me earning pretty okay money (€75k anually), if I was to become a freelance OneTrust consultant, I would be able to make a lot more by helping all of these huge companies actually implement the system instead of hiring employees for the job, or paying exorbinate amounts to OneTrust for their different assistance packages (which honestly helps with very little).

Does anyone have any experience of being an independent OneTrust consultant (or similar GRC & Privacy tools)? If so, how easy/hard is it to get contact with companies and ’sell’ yourself (in the EU)? How much could you charge them? Any information would be very useful. The work that took me 2 years to accomplish at my current company, would honestly take me about 1 month now as, like I said, I know this product inside and out at this point.

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

> 17 comments so far and they’re all highly aligned. 

You put yourself at high risk of not getting paid, or not being paid appropriately, if:

1. The client isn’t ethical. E.g., they “forget” to report all or some sales, or they “miscategorize” sales so you don’t get credit)

And…

2. They have the brand power to drive sales. As an example, they may have a terrible reputation in the community that requires remediation before you’d have any success with them. 

And…

3. They do the basics to convert leads to sales. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve found that clients aren’t answering calls we sent them from hot leads. Lack of any follow-up is another common problem. Guess who they blame for their sales incompetence?

And…

4. They provide a quality service to your lead. If not, the lead/customer may not pay, they may pay less than the sales price, they may get a refund, etc.

And…

5. The client ACTUALLY gets paid.

All of the above are 100% out of your control. You accept a ton of risk for arguably little reward.

I would only advise doing something like this if you have worked with the client for some time, and are sure they don’t have any of the above common problems that the vast majority of businesses have.

Also, only do something if you are rock-solid confident in your ability to deliver. I don’t mean having blind faith that you’ll rise to the occasion. I mean you’ve done it dozens of times, you know very specifically what you’re getting into, and you know exactly what it will take of you and the client to pull it off. Think science, not emotion. 

Lastly, you must get full buy-in from the client that they will do their part. Not a token “yah sure,” - a contractual obligation do so with a penalty if they don’t fulfill their end of the agreement (you’ll have wasted your time and money if they don’t).

If I were in your position, I would opt for a combination of what u/willmanracing and u/its_akhil_mishra have recommended.

1. Lower your base recurring fees. 

2. Ask the client to increase ad spend.

3. Negotiation to get paid per lead. 

I wouldn’t get into the business of calling my clients customers to qualify them. That’s time consuming, you’ll likely have trouble reaching many of them, and it’s messy AF. In the end, it won’t matter when your client disagrees with your assessment that a prospect is qualified. 

Sell leads if anything. I’d avoid selling leads that the client says are good leads (remember, they have to do all of those five things above to make this worthwhile for you, and if they’re unethical it’ll be easy for them to wave their hand and say a lead sucks). It’s stay clear of selling revenue. 

To that last point, NEVER link your payment to their profit or profit per lead you send them. It’s almost impossible for business owners to accurately determine profit per customer, and requires substantial assumption of activity base costing that are literally none of your business. Their profit is 100% out of your control even if

> Great question with a difficult answer.

Unfortunately I've seen some clients ask for proposals/tenders like these as a negotiating tactic. They ask for all-inclusive pricing with the full knowledge that they'll cut out big parts and get the cheapest possible.

It's really hard to retroactively price, but what I would do is send over the same services "broken out" and say that your previous tender had an X% discount for the whole package.

Don't take the hit to the bottom line. I don't think it's worth it, even more so because cheap clients like this are usually terrible to work with. They will continue nickel & diming you.

The only way to solve this is by not offering a la carte in the first place (not always an option, but probably worth exploring for the future). After a few times of having bad experiences offering a la carte services, around five years ago we shifted our agency to all or nothing. We work on a flat fee retainer model: you get the whole shebang of ad management, ongoing optimization, reporting, dashboard, analytics, or you don't get anything at all.

Using VoIP, your virtual receptionist can receive calls from anywhere with a solid internet connection and then easily divert them to the appropriate members of your staff. This flexibility makes it ideal for remote work situations, ensuring that your small business can continue to operate smoothly regardless of your receptionist's location. Additionally, VoIP systems are generally user-friendly and easy to set up, which means you won't have to spend much time learning the ins and outs of the technology. Overall, utilizing a virtual receptionist with VoIP capabilities is a great solution for ensuring efficient communication within your small business.  [So, it's definitely worth considering for your current situation.  In fact, many businesses are now using VoIP to streamline their communication processes, especially with the rise of remote work and virtual teams.

It allows your receptionist to receive calls over the internet from her rural location and then easily divert them to the appropriate staff members, regardless of where they are. This technology is designed to make remote working seamless and efficient, making it an ideal solution for your business's needs. With VoIP, the geographical location of your team becomes irrelevant, enabling smooth communication just as if you were all in the same office. This can also save your business money on long-distance call charges, making it a practical and cost-effective choice. Whether you know about VoIP or not, implementing this technology will significantly benefit your business operations. So, to answer your question, VoIP is worth considering for your remote receptionist needs.

Additionally, with the rise in virtual work environments, VoIP has become essential for businesses to maintain effective communication and collaboration among their team members. It offers various features such as call forwarding, voicemail-to-email, and virtual faxing, which can significantly enhance the productivity of your remote receptionist and overall business operations. Furthermore, utilizing a virtual receptionist from a company like VMeDx would provide the technical support for implementing VoIP and a trained professional to handle your incoming calls, ensuring a seamless and professional experience for your clients.

> Hi everyone -

  
I'm the IT guy (in my spare time; not a real job) for a (very) small medical office. They currently have four phone lines (one of which is fax) through their ISP. The fax line I can split off to a hipaa-compliant service, and they really only need two phone lines, not three. Two users. Nothing fancy, minimal needs. Outbound calling used around 600-700 minutes over the last month (not sure about inbound). I'm located a few hours away, so I can't really provide in-person support.

  
There's so much out there to try to make sense of. Again, it's a small shop, and I'm not well-versed in phone/voip (yet). We need auto-attendant (press 1 for X, press 2 for Y), but that's about it. Maybe voicemail / call transferring (receptionist picks up, transfers the call). Current after-hours system is to send a page to one of the users. No need for AI or anything big and complicated.



I've been looking at Google Workspace/Voice, O365/Teams Phone, Grasshopper, Dialpad, that kind of stuff. My users currently have physical phones, and while simplicity is certainly welcome, I don't think headsets/headphones are any kind of dealbreaker.



We currently use MS word/excel but don't have any subscriptions (standalone licenses from a few years back), so it miiiight be worth signing up for O365 to keep desktop apps updated, too? I've been a RingCentral customer and would prefer to probably not use them again (too big and heavy for our needs). I just signed up for [voip.ms](http://voip.ms) to play around with it, but I know very little about SIP and making all that work - I think I can do it, I've just never done it before.



Any help would be really appreciated. At this very moment, I'm very loosely leaning towards O365 & Teams Phone purely for the desktop apps and maybe onedrive, but I just don't know. Maybe Google. I'm driving myself in circles. I use google voice personally and it works well for my needs (I'd get them Google Workspace accounts, wouldn't use the free stuff).



I've been hands-off with their phones, but after looking at their monthly bills, I'm definitely thinking to switch things up. If anyone has any recommendations or can point out what I might be overlooking, that'd be a big help. Thank you!!

> Road warrior here. I’ve been doing this now for a little over 12 years and I actually really love it. I’m lucky enough that I get to choose my own destiny and control most of how and where I travel (but not always). A few things that I do to help keep it interesting - YMMV.   
  
• Early flights only where possible. No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   
  
• Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. 

• Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. 

• Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   
  
• Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    
  
• Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   
  
• Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   
  
• Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   
  
• Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  
  
• Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   
  
• One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   
  
• Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   
  
• Know when to break the routine. If you’re going to a com

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-29 | 5pts

> I'm going to first put two pieces of advice I wrote in a different thread, slightly modifie; then address some of your specific questions:

I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. 

Here is what you need to make this work.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps

> Super exciting! Congrats on the opportunity. You're going to crush it.

One very helpful mantra I have learned ([from DHH of Basecamp](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71)) I tell myself all the time is: **when you plan a project, you are doing so with the absolute worst understanding of the problem.**

When I first started my agency (one year ago, still very new to the game), I was completely paralyzed when it came to writing my first proposals. I told myself: *"how am I supposed to confidently present a plan for something...when I've never done that thing? They'll know I'm full of shit...or I'll estimate everything all wrong and will look like a fool."* So my advice is keep your proposal as simple as possible, focus on the things you do know to be true versus what is variable, and know that projects will always evolve over their course. Priorities shift, clients want changes, what you launch doesn't work perfectly, etc. This is fundamental to the process of making anything, and going in with a positive and adaptable mindset is the most helpful frame.

* **In terms of time,** that's an easy place to start - how much can you realistically devote \*without\* impacting other parts of your life that are important to you? **Only you and you alone can set your boundaries.** So if the answer is 2 hours every other day (so Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), then the answer is 6 hours per week. If you don't draw a clear line in the sand, the people you're working with won't know what is reasonable for you - so they'll ask for more. And not because they're inherently demanding, just because they don't know your boundaries. And without boundaries, you'll come to resent the work - and that's a bad place to be. So ask yourself what *you* *want*.
* **What you do vs delegate**: again, this is all about your boundaries. It seems like it's important for you \*not\* to run socials yourself, so make that clear to your business partner. Offer to work together to find someone who can dot hat work that works within the project's budget. Or, if you want to take ownership of hiring and managing that person, that's your choice - just make sure the price you charge incorporates that cost.
* **Your hourly rate** is hard to help out with without more information. It depends on your location, your years of experience, the project's budget, what similar consultants in your area/market charge for similar services, and more.
   * But since this is your first project, I wouldn't get too hung up on price - you can always charge more for the next project. I would consider the floor price the minimum amount that is worth your time. Said another way, it can't be *so low* that when you're mid-way through the project, you're upset that you didn't charge enough. That's another easy path towards resentment and feeling taken advantage of.
   * Another way to think about it is: if you put a price that's too high in your proposal, your bus

> A few options...  
  
1. **Do nothing**. 

Don't accept the deal and see where it goes. Maybe they'll forget about it...maybe not. Not a great option. It's best to transparently discuss these kinds of things with your clients.

2. **Take the deal**. 

If you take the deal then there are many side effects to consider.   
a) What's the opportunity cost? Not just financially from other deals that will no longer materialize, but also in the risk of working for just one client.   
b) Can you guarantee they will pay you?   
c) Can you guarantee that they'll continue to use your services?  For how long and at what levels?  
d) Can you gain exclusivity with them too? In other words, if you can't work for anyone else, will they commit to not hiring anyone else for their YT/socials? This is a real threat because it's 100% possible and even likely that they could dilute what they give you over time.    
e) Can you get a higher rate or more services (e.g., not just YT, but what about other platforms too like IG) that with your existing arrangement?  
f) What are the contract terms? How long are they locking in for? I'd make it at least two years.

3) **Reject the deal**. 

The big con with their proposal is that they'll be taking 100% of your agency's resources, bandwidth, and future opportunities. If you take a deal, you're effectively not an agency anymore...you're a contract vehicle to provide individual talent to a single client...a staff augmentation contractor. You wouldn't have much of a future, if any, as an agency. There's nothing wrong with that and you can can probably make some dough with the arrangement, but it's a completely different business model. If you're considering rejecting the deal, first review possible alternatives that could make the arrangement more to your liking and reduce the client concentration risk. Push hard to make it the right deal for you, because worst case, the deal and relationship fall apart and you're back to being an agency. What's really the worst case to rejecting the deal? You go get more work elsewhere, and there's plenty of that to go around. 

4) **Proposal an alternative arrangement**. 

Counteroffers could be:  
a) Tweaking any proposed terms or items listed in the rest of this answer.  
b) Insist on the ability to take on other work. It'd be in your best interest to have as few restrictions as possible.   
c) Make sure you get paid and handsomely.    
d) They buy you out. They'll going to be taking 100% of your agency bandwidth, and why not just acquire you? 

I hope this helps you think through your options.

I don't have any reviews. Doesn't mean I'm bad. I've worked in Meta and several other big tech brands as well as running ads for my own startup.

Not having reviews or not means very little. Most business owners/marketing teams are too busy to leave reviews. Then you have agencies like KlientBoost, who I know for a fact, who pays for reviews.   


>Look at how they do their own advertised services for themselves. If they are a web developer, how is their website? If they run ads, find their ads on Facebook Ad Library or Google Searches by searching the agency names. Do they come up? What's the quality like?

I don't know if ads are any good just by looking at them, so I'm not sure how you would gain any insight from that. We don't know how they're doing their retargeting, how those ads are delivered, which part of the funnel they're being delivered to, etc... 

We can make assumptions based on copy and design with what little information we have, but I would say making assumptions isn't very effective in the majority of situations--especially with little context. 

In fact, it's well-known that B2B champions and decision makers start the procurement process through social by speaking to their peers--dark social. So depending on the target deal size and service complexity, it might be beneficial to not run ads at all and instead focus on content.   


>Look at their previous work and case studies on their website. Do they have them? Check out the companies they mentioned. Look at how that company is doing the services the agency claims to provide. Is it well done?

Case studies are low-hanging fruit with dramatic results. They aren't peer-reviewed. Not an effective way to demonstrate expertise nor judge it. There is an exception here--progress over time. It's also best if they can provide rationale. Multiple wins over an extended period of time which shows that they deliver beyond low-hanging fruits and can do more than push buttons.   


>Look to see if the agency is organized and follows structured methods. Ask to see their SOPs, also known as standard operations procedures, to see if they have one. Do they have a clear system for getting started and taking you through the processes? How do they manage their client relationship? How do they know that they are failing you?

I don't have anything to argue here. This is clearly necessary. But how really just how detailed are those SOPs? Also is there an emphasis on strategic thinking? Because I worked at a large international agency, and that's what people lacked most.

> But tea leaves aside, what you really want to do here (like any good consultant :) is to ask lots of questions. Like so: "So, I'm very excited about this opportunity! But since I've never worked in consultancy, I'm just trying to build up a picture of how you all work here.

**Client**: who's the commissioning client (level / role)? who do you liaise with day-to-day? what's their budget? what typically leads them to work with you in the first place? 

**Competition**: who do you compete against for these contracts? Who are the hardest competitors to beat? Why?

**Case**: what's the typical scope? What's the largest / smallest project you ever worked on? What are 'deliverables'? Who approves them? How much do you usually iterate? Describe the 'ideal' project for your firm - what made it ideal? Now describe the 'not great' version - what made it suck?

**Core competencies**: what makes your firm suited to the type of work it does? how would clients describe it?

**Collaboration**: how do you work with the client? what is the best possible setup? what's a bad setup? (how close is the 'usual' to best / worst?)

**Case team**: who's on the team? What are their levels and backgrounds? Where do you like to hire from (firms, universities, backgrounds)? Are they dedicated to one project / multiple projects? -- What's a 'typical day' like when you're on a project? What's a typical day like when you're 'on the beach' (not staffed on a project)?

**Commercials**: How do you win new business? How do pitches work (custom? standardised-ish?) Who wins new contracts? And how will you be involved? --  How do make money (billable hours? deliverables? all-inproject fee?). How do you price your services? Are clients price-sensitive? 

Now ideally don't turn this into an interrogation, but make sure you get good answers in the course of a conversation. Read between the lines, and try to build up a picture of a typical day, and that of a bad day.

(Top tip: joining as a manager / director? ask to have a chat with one of the more junior team members, and get answers to the same questions. Read between the lines ofc, but you should get a really solid read)

Not to quibble, but you said = google voice told me...    in a chat / call?  Or a web page?  In general I am disappointed in most EVERY business and it's a running joke with my wife - ask a question and get an answer.  Ask someone else at the company and get a different answer.  and rarely, if you ask a 3rd person there, that you get a same answer as a tie breaker.

and you mention google voice isn't offering a permanent number.... not sure of the interface, but you don't want a number they offer you.  You want to port in your number and THAT will be a permanent number.

Down a rabbit hole..... I googled $10 google voice and got told it's called starter:

Googling google voice starter plan port in, I get:

**You cannot port a number into the Starter plan for Google Voice. Number porting is only available for Google Voice for Business plans, which require a Google Workspace account, not the individual, free, or paid plans of personal Google Voice. You will need to set up a business account to port a number into Google Voice.** 

So that's wrong at least on this:....  number porting IS available on the personal / individual plans.

And starter?  There's a personal version (you are on?) and business?

That's googling / AI answers about a GOOGLE service.  

I get soooo frustrated at the inability to get accurate answers from companies.   perfect example here - you will likely get more accurate info from someone (seems like it won't be from me... sorry!) here rather than google's own pages.

> THE ISSUES: 

We get no coordination between phones, one phone will ring and the other won't acknowledge a call ever happened. Our call histories are completely different, even after waiting a day and signing out and in we can never get anything to match. Better yet, you can't even seem to delete a simple text message from the application when you want to, instead receiving an error message that it's unable to be deleted. 

The voicemail is a huge disappointment. There's no voicemail box that can be accessed from both phones via the app. Instead one user gets the voicemail and the other gets an email with the voicemail attached. I could live with that except the voicemail is attached in .wav format which is not supported by any extension in existence on google chrome so every voicemail needs to be downloaded to just listen to it. 

Text messaging (we have our 10 DLC registration) seems to decide on whether it will work or not day by day. Sometimes messages send, sometimes they don't, but they always show they sent on my end just adding to the confusion and irritation. I end up often having to give customers my personal number so that we can effectively communicate. The entire reason I have a VoIP is to just use one number and now we have customers that have three numbers, exactly what I wanted to absolutely avoid! 

Don't even get me started on the Bluetooth connectivity with vehicles, it's bizarre. If I had been on a call at and get into my vehicle at a later time, long after the call has ended my vehicle Bluetooth thinks there is a phone call in process. But there is no phone call and the only way to get my phone to connect correctly is to completely restart my phone, closing the Nextiva app doesn't have an affect at all.

Worst yet is the scenario when I try to answer a call while connected to Bluetooth. When I pick up, the music lowers volume but does not stop or turn off completely. It continues to play via the car speakers but sounds as if it is playing through the phone speakers (poor audio quality) at the same time the callers voice comes through the speakers as the music continues to play but at a very low volume (even when volume is all the way up). I have no idea if the caller can hear the music on their side but its impossible for me to hear them anyways so I have to be sure to turn off Bluetooth before taking a Nextiva call. When taking a phone call on my actual phone, none of these issues exist. 

This has happened on both my Galaxy S20 Ultra and my new Galaxy S22 Ultra (just upgraded a couple weeks ago) so it's not a phone issue. Making things EVEN worst is the fact that I have "Number Garage" another VoIP service on my phone for another business that I do not own but manage. That VoIP and application that costs a FRACTION of what Nextiva costs seems to work flawlessly with little to no issues in comparison. 

Now I am unsure on what direction to go in, I've been researching other VoIPs but hesitant to make any decision because I a

> "If you're not making the firm money then why would they continue to employ you."

For the same reason that the firm employs folks like the receptionist, the Intake Specialist, the Office Services Clerks, the Records Manager, the IT Manager, and the Biller.

None of those folks can bill their time to clients for what they do.  But, what they do SAVES the firm more money than it costs to pay them.

Firing a paralegal - especially a paralegal who has expertise in an Admin function like Billing, or IT, or Records management, or Risk Management - is wasteful, and could expose the firm to wrongful termination claims in the future.

The much more cost-efficient strategy is to re-train or cross-train paralegals who are failing to meet billable requirements into doing some of the cost-saving functions that the firm needs just as much as time-billers as profit centers.

Using what you have - instead of wasting money to recruit, hire, train and retain new talent - is one of the principles of Strategic Management.  Since you didn't mention it, that indicates that you went straight to law school from undergrad.

> I personally think Clio is the biggest waste of time possible, but my current Of Counsel home insists on it, mainly for conflicts checks. They pay for it as part of their split.

I personally find that Clio just adds an extra layer of hassle because it doesn't integrate well with outlook, doesn't integrate at all with mobile (seriously, I can't email a PDF on mobile?? In 2024???), and I have to constantly reinstall it when I switch from desktop to laptop.

So, after a few weeks of fighting with it I just save everything to dropbox first and then drag it over to clio. If I need to email someone a PDF from my phone, dropbox makes it possible. Whatever. It's their money and I'm a team player.

As for a receptionist, I don't see the need. The clients and realtors get my cell. On the extremely rare occasions that a client abuses this privilege, caller ID saves the day and I just decline the calls, close the deal, and never work with that client again.

If those systems help you make more money than they cost you, though, more power to you. Always interesting to see how different systems work in different set ups.

> I worked for a solo six months after he hung his shingle in 1997 until 2022.  Hire the most experienced paralegal you can afford.  I slowly took over many of the routine office management responsibilities to give him more time for rainmakering.  Don't be afraid to hand off responsibilities that slow you down, and include this person in meetings for things like insurance needs, office supply needs, light bookkeeper needs, and other ordinary "office running" necessities.  If you should get sick, which happened in my case, I needed to know where things were and who to call.  Same with setting up an agreement with another attorney who can sign routine pleadings in an emergency.   In our case, my bosses illness was severe enough where a Notice of Unavailability needed to be filed in some cases to extend litigation deadlines.  These are the kinds of things you never think will happen, but do.

We had a receptionist full time and experimented with using just a phone service to take messages.  For us, that bombed. Yes, it was significantly cheaper, but our clients liked (and were willing to pay for) handholding.  Our receptionist was a gem, and I credit her caring nature in the office for client retention.

Remember, this is old school advice.  I happen to have my own personal personal injury case going with another firm that does everything remotely.  Right now, because my case has been reassigned (yet again), I wouldn't be able to recognize my own attorney or any staff if I walked into a courtroom.  It is certainly not a full service firm as I have been responsible for delivering documents any paralegal could easily obtain to move my case forward.  We were a full service firm.  I believe there are plenty of clients still willing to pay for full service.

Advertising is so different now. I can't offer any helpful information.  It's all so different now.

If I can help, let me know.  There were decisions that were great, and others that bombed and wasted so much money.

> Depends on what area and how you’re getting new clients now. 

Shrug - It’s true most people won’t hire you from social media. But most won’t hire you from a website either. But they will get to know you and your firm. They’ll get to watch video, see how you interact with others - see if they fit in with your culture and eventually they’ll hire you. The more exposure they have to you, the more likely that conversion will happen and happen sooner. 

It used to be people had to have 7-10 touches with a business before buying since we’re all bombarded with ads all day everyday it takes 23-25 now. Having consistent social media posting is one way to do that. 

If you’re running ads on social media consistent posting will help with better targeting thus reducing your ad costs as it reaches the right people more consistently. Since some law firms are now getting business through being recommended by AI (aka geo) regular posting on social media is one of the “trust signals” AI uses those to prioritize who it recommends. 

When someone looks at a law firm to hire now they don’t just go to Google (or the yellow pages as they did before Google) most will ask friends and family, go to Google and then stalk their socials and website to see “is this someone I connect with.” 

Honestly the #1 factor I’ve seen is how fast you answer the phone and get them in the door when they’re ready to hire. But again it depends more on your firm’s specialties- family law, criminal, immigration, PI - when they need an attorney NOW they’ll grab who gets them in first. Contact disputes they’ll dig through everything about them. Wills, estates, trademark most are referral businesses. 

I’d never say give them up totally but wouldn’t make it a top part of your marketing budget if you’re struggling  - plus as someone else mentioned you need to save your name or someone else will snag it up and then when you do want it charge you to get it back.

> Could not agree more, don't mix messages. Focus more on the PI website and immediately start working with a company to help you optimize SEO.  It will take you a long time to see results but you'll quickly learn how much more profitable a direct in case is versus a referred in case.  

There are a lot of charlatans in the SEO space it's taking us years to find a reputable company, and even they aren't perfect.

Unless you have an unlimited trust fund, you'll never be able to compete with the big marketers in your area. There are probably multiple firms with eight figure marketing budgets.  You have to figure out where they've left gaps in their coverage and paint those corners.  Make sure your personal network knows what you do.   Your style is your style, but there are ways to remind your Facebook friends what you do (posting about a hearing or interesting details about a specific case, check in at your state bureau of investigation when you take a medical examiners's deposition) without coming across as an ambulance chaser.   

Figure out how AI can help you .  I'm no expert, but it's amazing how much time the upgraded ChatGPT account has saved me.   By no means is it perfect and be careful for legal research, but proofreading briefs and stylistic improvements can be amazing.  Upload your motion and the defendants responses, provide other helpful details like depositions, and let GPT brainstorm creative arguments or pour out inconsistencies in the defendants briefing, etc. Just make sure to check everything before you cite.  Spend time creating good prompts and you can easily summarize depositions or create timelines etc.

Try to share Office space with other personal injury firms if possible. It's amazing how many successful strategies we've developed were ideas of other attorneys shared during an encounter in the hallway 

If you don't already, get an assistant or paralegal ASAP. Both for optics (who wants a lawyer who answers their own phone) and because your time is much more valuable generating business or closing out your cases than licking stamps and sending letters .  

Finally, get a good bookkeeper ASAP. Don't waste your time doing quick book entries unless you have significant bookkeeping/accounting experience. Trust accounts are no joke and you can get in big Doodoo if you mess that up, even innocently.

Enjoy!   I started with no cases and an $800 HP computer attached to a dropbox account – now we have a 20 person Firm and handle 7 to 9 figure cases.   I say that not to brag but as context for this statement: the most enjoyable years in my career were the first 3 to 5 of the firm when we were building the Firm and trying to figure it out.   Of all the recoveries over the years, the most memorable was that first million dollar settlement, which felt like proof of concept for us.    It's a ton of fun!

> I think you didn't quite catch what I wrote. Time keeping is already integrated into the CLM. In Clio, I select my client and then push the "send email" button. It will automatically create a billable entry. I have document automation integrated into Clio... I select my client and then select the "Draft Petition" button and it will automatically draft a petition and create a billable entry.

I don't see how paying for an entirely separate system will help at all. What time will I save? The billable entry is already recorded on the client's invoice.

For billable entries that are manually recorded and take place outside of clio, I am very skeptical that you can do what you claim you can do in an efficient manner. If I'm researching case law on LexisAdvance, how will you know what client it's for? How will you account for interruptions and phone calls, and when my boss walks into my office?

There is a reason attorneys record their time throughout the day as they work on things. Trying to remember what you did for every 6 minute increment throughout the entire workday is literally impossible.

I wouldn't even trust myself to approve the AI generated summary. What if it misses something for one client, and bills it to the wrong client? I honestly probably won't even catch the mistake even with your AI generated summary. I will only know I made the mistake when some angry client calls my office to complain he is getting billed for work that was completed for other clients. How embarrassing that would be...

Honestly, is this even solving a problem that I have? I don't think so. The more I think about this... This doesn't even seem like a solution at all. This is not even a solution searching for a problem. This seems like a software that will create even more work for me and should be avoided at all costs.

> Beating up your attorneys won’t solve the issue.

My previous firm went through this. 

1) first they hired an “office manager” that brought big corp/big law style drama into our little firm.


That didn’t help matters at all and now the owner of this little 3 attorney firm is paying a full time position for someone whose only job is nag and harass attorneys about “their KPIs” and makes them waste time with a whole new layer of meetings and bureaucracy.

2) then he hired a “customer relationship manager”, in other words a 25 year old dude that picks up the phone and books meetings.

Did I mention that we also have a receptionist that picks up the phone and books meetings?  Did I mention both usually end passing the phone calls to the paralegals anyway? 

That’s another role/extra mouth to feed. 

3) then they began screeching about KPIs,case turnover and all that.  We have never had an issue with case turnover, we were a lean and mean firm! But now the “office manager” has to justify his job, and that means harassing the lawyers and paralegals. And now we have an “office manager” and a “CRM specialist” who are just overhead, so we gotta BILL BILL BILL!

4) so the firm’s owner decided it was time to cut costs… FINALLY! Ok, good, we will be back on track 🙂…. Wait, how is he going to cut costs? By doing the same greedy little thing you suggested, he fired an attorney and one parelegal so he could hire 3 “virtual paralegals” based in India and Philippines and a “foreign attorney” from India who does the stuff and sends it to the other attorneys to review because he can’t really do the attorney job without a US license, so now there is even more stuff on the (real) attorney’s plate, who are already getting choked by the ridiculous KPIs and harassment they’re subject to because they have to pay for the overhead cause by the office manager and the CRM guy.

Guess how the firm is doing now? Hint; I got the heck out of there because it’s a sinking ship. They were just fine from a profitability perspective and from a legal quality perspective until these “amazing optimizations” and “improvements in efficiency” were implemented.

Last I heard this firm is not worried about their rapidly declining profitability because “they will use AI to improve efficiency”, so I guess they are firing a paralegal or two, maybe even an attorney, “ai and smart forms will do it all”.

> I used Ruby when they first launched years ago. Wasn’t a huge call center then and there were assigned receptionists (team) to our account. 90% of the time we got one of the team receptionists…during higher caller volume or overflow it was someone else but no issues. Sold that business and don’t know if they continued with them or not. But used them for a couple years. 

Switched to a local provider for current business. Prices for Ruby have gone up, sure. It wasn’t 24/7/365 coverage back then nor did we need that. We don’t have that now from the current local provider, either. But you expect people to pay $3.50 a minute for overage on a starter or entry level plan? Or $2.25 on a basic plan? Your pricing of your packages is completely inconsistent. Where did you go to business school? Also where is your HIPAA compliance policy? PCI compliance policy? I would absolutely pay Ruby MORE for peace of mind and not worrying about the inherent liability. Are you receptionists bilingual?

Your site also mentions a dedicated personal receptionist “coming soon” and suggests we sign up and pay now to get on the waiting list. So it’s like Ruby used to except they did a small team? I’d consider paying your prices if the person(s) were dedicated.

We pay less now than your rates and have dedicated person(s) and don’t have any compliance concerns. If you offer a demo or trial I’d give you a shot as I have no idea what your backend looks like. I hope the client portal isn’t designed like your Wordpress site. Also hope it’s not an off the shelf solution that will have integration issues. 

Not trying to crap on your company…just was pointing out your pricing is grandiose. But I guess it makes sense if you putting yourself in the same league as Ruby, Abby, Smith AI, Nexa etc.. Correct me if I’m wrong, but are you on that level? If so, congrats.

> My response is anecdotal, but I’ve seen this movie play out. About 10 years ago (around 2015), I attended a small-firm / solo practitioner tech show run by a state bar association (US State). Most case-management vendors there were locally hosted. Only one was cloud-first: Clio. The on-prem vendors spent a surprising amount of time bad-mouthing “the cloud.” It got borderline absurd. Some were using Google Drive and Google Cloud interchangeably, warning lawyers that Google was mining their data, and citing Gmail ads as “proof.” I personally believed the cloud was inevitable, but at the time I could not convince most small firms that cloud convenience would win out long-term.

Fast-forward \~10 years. Same conference :There is exactly one self-hosted case-management vendor left. They’re still there largely because 90% of their customers are in that state, they still accept paper checks, and they’re running a very healthy lifestyle business (I chatted with the owner).

Meanwhile, Clio is now the legal-tech darling with massive scale and late-stage funding.

So my takeaway:If you plan to keep this as a niche or lifestyle business, a fully offline / local-only solution absolutely has a market. If you plan to scale, cloud (or at least some hybrid) is almost unavoidable. Security arguments eventually lose to convenience. Not because lawyers stop caring about confidentiality, but because workflow gravity wins. If your product won’t trade some risk for speed and convenience, another one will.  
That said, I think your best option is not either/or: Local storage vs Cloud, Private or single-tenant hosted LLMs, Optional offline mode. It might be a combination of both.

A pure desktop, compute-heavy AI product runs into very real friction: Aging laptop,Locked-down IT environments, Firms that can approve case budgets but not hardware upgrades

At that point you’re selling not just software, but fighting IT policy and capital budgets. So yes, “fully offline” is a real selling point , just not a mass-market one. The trick is deciding whether you want to optimize for control and certainty, or scale and convenience, and designing the product so you don’t paint yourself into a corner. While the cloud only (i.e. public LLM) has a lot of players, you might have a niche with desktop and a different flavor with a private hosted version.

> Maybe the answer is to focus on building other skills until you can leave or you can try education. Before you bring up the topic again, consider their side (use your lawyering skills). 

Maybe they don’t want to do it because they have no written privacy policy and so would be in for it with the malpractice insurance if there is ever an issue. And yes, if anyone at the firm is using the free version of most LLMs then you cannot guarantee client privacy. 
Maybe they don’t want to put notice of AI use in their retainer letter because they don’t know how to answer a client questioning why they should get paid if they can just have AI do it. (This is a good one for you to articulate for yourself as you may have to sell future clients on why you choose to use AI and how it makes you more valuable to them as a lawyer instead of less. And speed, low cost can’t be the answer because then the even faster/cheaper option is to do it themselves.)
Maybe they assume that all you have to do is ask a magic question, and your perfectly drafted motion pops out. Or they are afraid this isn’t actually the case, but don’t want to have to learn how to properly prep and prompt. 
Maybe they just don’t want to spend the time setting it up. 
Maybe it’s something completely random, like a grandchild’s expulsion because they plagiarized their term paper from Wikipedia back in the day.

And it makes for interesting interview content as it’s something that’s a value add to a firm that may have this, but incompletely. )
I think it’s worth it to see if you can actually get all their fears or concerns out. There may be issues you haven’t considered. And if you’re only seeing your side, it’s hard to change anyone’s mind.

> Hi! So, I graduated from law school in 2021. Ten days after graduation, my wife passed away. As you can imagine, my post-graduation employment wasn't going to work. I knocked out the bar while handling my wife's affairs and hung out a shingle in my hometown so I could help my in-laws, etc. 

Since then, it's been pretty good. I average about $2-4k/week depending on what I'm focusing on. Problem is that I spend about 10-20 hours/week drumming up more work to get into the pipeline. If you're willing to take the odd one-off projects -- such as reviewing a commercial lease for a small business for $500 -- between more complex litigation and business clients, then it's definitely workable.  
  
One note: there are incidental costs that you don't think about at first. Ooma for my office phone costs like $50/month. My domain, email service, and website are about another $100/month. Then there's your portion of the FICA taxes, whether or not you're an S-Corp. You pay for your own insurance. You get the idea.   
  
And there's always the dreaded accounts receivable issue -- some people don't like to pay their bills. One law firm I did contract work for still owes me $10,000 that I'll have to sue for most likely. That'll be a pain. 

Finally, there are emotional costs I didn't expect. It's hard to hear the schizophrenic people leave voicemails; you can hear how much they are suffering with their delusions. People struggling through addiction will cry when you tell them that their criminal charge can't be expunged/sealed. You'll never do enough pro bono work to stem the tide of need out there, but you'll feel like you can and should do more anyway.   

With that said, I feel like there's a limit on what you can do yourself without working for other attorneys. I've been feeling like an unevenly sharpened knife lately. Because I am in charge of what work I get, I naturally gravitate toward my strengths which leaves my weaknesses to atrophy further. I just finished revising my resume and plan on putting out feelers to see what's out there. My hope is that a stint with a law firm could help me polish myself into something more refined and effective. 

I hope this helps. =)

> We have had Vonage since 2010 and they haven't been great, but they have been good enough for us to stick with them. .   
This year the wheels have come off, so we need to begin to consider other options.  We are a very small nonprofit so cost is a significant factor in our choices.  

Our NEEDS: 

* One number for all calls in & out
* Voicemail 
* Dashboard accessible via and able to make calls via web browser (not phone app dependent) 
* Ability to send & receive SMS 
* Easy to switch outgoing V/M message (for office closures, etc)

* Reliable service that doesn't go down frequently or significantly change without prior notice and options

Our WANTS: 

* Ability to schedule SMS in advance
* Ability to send/receive images or attachments via SMS
* Voicemail transcription

We currently have 2 lines and pay about $80/month and if possible would like to stay in that range.

> I use Back Office Betties and am pleased with their service. They don't charge for spam calls, which is fantastic. They do all the things you mentioned. Not cheap, but absolutely worth it.

With all services, every now and then they'll bungle a call, and you will need to set up rules for call handling and answering questions. One thing I appreciate about BOB is that they make it easy to tweak instructions.

No service is perfect, but neither are most full-time employee receptionists. I have someone do a mystery call every now and then, with me listening, just to check quality. 

Someone else mentioned how people will usually be happier to leave a message with a human than to leave a voicemail, and I agree. Many times I've heard people say mine was the first firm that actually answered the call, and how that made a difference to them.

> I think the main problem is that you will have a very hard time attracting your ideal of "institutional clients or sophisticated defendants charged with white collar crimes".

If I'm in their shoes, I would want a lawyer who is very experienced in white collar crime (you only have 5 years as a lawyer), someone who has support with paralegals or associate lawyers (so they can handle it if the case gets big with lots of witnesses or documents), someone who has experience in the local legal market so they have relationships with the prosecutors to have a better chance at making deals (you're a transplant so you don't know the prosecutors), and someone who they can get a referral for from a friend/colleague/the other lawyers that they pay instead of just picking a name out of Google (you don't have a local network). 

I don't know why these clients would pick you, instead of a lawyer who meets more of those criteria. The only thing you might be able to compete on clearly is price, but these clients have money and would probably prefer to pay more if they got a better perceived chance of success in their criminal case. I can't see a handful of internet ads you pay for changing any of that.

If your plan was more a more general criminal law focus, I think you'd be ok. You might also try to push federal criminal defense as a subspeciality, in my state it's often notably harder to find a lawyer to practice in federal court compared to state court.

If you want some complexity to keep yourself interested, dip your toes into 1983 civil rights cases. A certain percent of your generic criminal law clients will have viable cases, plus you can try to network in your criminal defense lawyer groups for these sort of referrals (the vast majority just refer these cases out).

Also, you need some sort of actual or virtual receptionist to field calls for you.  If people call and they get a voicemail, they usually hang up instead of leaving a message.

> What's your practice area, and what size of city are you in?

When I started out the only thing that worked right away was Google Ads. I made less on those files, but made sure to get good reviews. Within a year I was top of the map pack in my practice area for my city (smallish city). You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick. Also, always ask for a review (unless you mess things up -- in which case I always [only happened once] give full refund and complete work).

I have an SEO guy now. I went through SO MANY, it was frustrating. But finding a good one was worth it. I would strongly caution against a falt-fee or retainer model -- they just pump out AI slop. I pay hourly and we have targets in mind (organic clicks). SEO is pretty great once it's done right, but it does take forever, and I spent way too much on what probably weren't technically scams, but that felt that way. 

I tried to make FB ads work. They are so cheap, but I could never convert them. 

Oh, and here's the industry standard as far as I know for setting calls. You need a receptionist. It's a free consultation to speak to the receptionist, who bills CC for a paid intake call with you. Don't speak to clients for free, or they essentially never close (unless your PI, I don't know how that works). You can get an assistant/receptionist part time, just post on indeed. But you will have to figure out payroll if you do.

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

> I'm a PI lawyer, and I have been us⁤ing a virtual receptionist (real people) for the last three years.

It took a few weeks for them to get things really dialed in, and there was some upfront work. But after that, it was incredibly worth it. 

It especially helps when I increase my marketing and need help with calls. 

Financially it makes a ton of sense. If they even capture a handful of cases a month, you make many times your money back. 

Especially helpful in practice areas where speed to lead is crucial. Also, steer clear of AI at all costs, or you'll regret it. Hope this helps.

> You need to formalize ownership and gatekeeping on your matters, in writing, and add a simple approval workflow.

Action plan:

\- Email the partner and that para: for my files, all opposing counsel comms go through me; filings sit in a Ready to File folder until I approve; 24-hour turnaround; 15‑minute weekly huddle to review deadlines. Put the matter number in every subject and use a clear naming rule for drafts vs finals.

\- Track errors in a neutral log; after two weeks, take the data and the workflow to the partner as “this protects clients and the firm,” not a personality fight.

\- Designate the receptionist as your file coordinator with limited authority (calendaring, service, medical records, follow‑ups). Cheaper than burning attorney time.

\- Self‑manage only high‑risk items (court filings, OC calls) until trust is earned; everything else runs through your checklist.

\- Bridge hire: pitch a contract/fractional para 10–15 hrs/week for 90 days with KPIs (cycle times, zero missed deadlines). Full‑time para makes sense once you consistently collect 2.5–3x their total cost and you’re at \~120–150 active WC files or 3+ trials/month.

On tools: I’ve used Clio and DocuSign, but SignWell’s templates and sequential routing cut our retainer/med‑auth back‑and‑forth and unclogged bottlenecks.

Formalize ownership and workflows now so you can serve clients and avoid burnout.

> Regus worked for us as a startup, but we quickly (within 1 year) had to get a real office due to the Google maps/marketing needs and all kinds of issues. Also they really nickle and dime ya over everything. They tried charging us ridiculous pricing for a phone line they didn’t even answer (We had it forwarded because their receptionists were so bad). We had to fight over charges not revealed in any contract, not given notification of, and Regus themselves couldn’t/wouldn’t actually give us a breakdown of how the charges were calculated. After threat of legal action, we parted ways and they tried to assign collections. More legal threats and they finally gave up.

It’ll work if you need an address and a decent looking office space to meet clients. But once you get going after 6-12 months and have some money coming in, jump to a real office immediately.

I’d generally recommend. They have good customer support for setup and when things go wrong. You have to be watchful of things like a lead needing urgent help and calling 5 times. That’ll cost you $50 plus. But they’ll take instructions like don’t take second calls and fwd to voicemail.

> been using virtual assistants for our firm for about a year now - definitely worth considering.

pros:
- huge cost savings vs full-time employee
- no benefits, office space, or equipment costs
- can get specialized skills (legal experience, specific software)
- flexibility to scale hours up/down

cons:

- finding quality ones is a pain - most are basic call center level
- security/confidentiality concerns with sensitive client info
- takes time to train on your specific processes

for law firms specifically, you really need someone who understands professional services and can handle confidential information properly.

what's worked for us is going through a service that pre-vets candidates specifically for professional services. we found someone who has previous legal admin experience and excellent communication skills. way better than the generic virtual receptionist companies.

the cost difference is massive - we're paying like 60% less than a full-time assistant but getting someone who's actually more skilled in certain areas.

given you're going from 2 to 1 assistant, a virtual one could help bridge that gap without the full overhead.

what kind of call volume and admin tasks are you looking to cover?

**Pros:**   
No missed calls = no missed clients  
Way cheaper than hiring full-time  
Handles intake, scheduling, basic Qs, frees up your assistant

**Cons:**  
Complex/legal Qs may still need you or your team

Tip: If calls are eating your time or your assistant’s, start with a receptionist just for phone coverage. You’ll know fast if it’s worth it.

I’m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.

Within the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn’t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.

6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person. I was finally comfortable spending 4k a month on a PI membership and the 1,400 on my criminal membership but my key account person got me a better deal I got the combo membership for only 4,600/month. The criminal clients are paying for this membership and then some. On the PI membership some of the clients are very good a lot are trash, but, the day a case came in involving a Walmart truck that killed someone I jumped on it and I settled for 7.5 million from that case. Now I’m taking PI statewide and Criminal only in the metropolitan I live in.

Anyone who says this didn’t work for them. It’s because they didn’t work the program. I have notifications on for my mobile app, my secretary is logged in on her phone and computer and I get emails. The two of us click on every new case as soon as it gets on and she’s trained to know a good vs a bad client and we respond right away. Either she’s calling to set up a consult or I’m calling to begin the consult and get them into the firm. The only time I’ve ever missed out on a client I was on vacation and my receptionist’s phone died. With there being a limited number of attorneys in each group this is unlike any other lead service, and I’ve used a lot of them.

> Okay so I’ve read the responses posted by other attorneys who have had “bad experiences” with legalmatch and I would like to share my story.

I’m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.

Within the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn’t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.

6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person. I was finally comfortable spending 4k a month on a PI membership and the 1,400 on my criminal membership but my key account person got me a better deal I got the combo membership for only 4,600/month. The criminal clients are paying for this membership and then some. On the PI membership some of the clients are very good a lot are trash, but, the day a case came in involving a Walmart truck that killed someone I jumped on it and I settled for 7.5 million from that case. Now I’m taking PI statewide and Criminal only in the metropolitan I live in.

Anyone who says this didn’t work for them. It’s because they didn’t work the program. I have notifications on for my mobile app, my secretary is logged in on her phone and computer and I get emails. The two of us click on every new case as soon as it gets on and she’s trained to know a good vs a bad client and we respond right away. Either she’s calling to set up a consult or I’m calling to begin the consult and get them into the firm. The only time I’ve ever missed out on a client I was on vacation and my receptionist’s phone died. With there being a limited number of attorneys in each group this is unlike any other lead service, and I’ve used a lot of them.

> A virtual receptionist can be a great solution for law firms that need professional support without the cost of a full-time admin. They can handle client calls, schedule appointments, and even manage bilingual communications, which would be especially helpful for your Spanish-speaking clients.

Many virtual receptionist services offer flexible pricing based on call volume. You can look into agencies like Mango Bibo, which provides legal support services and virtual assistants for law firms, including reception services. You can check them out here: [Mango Bibo Legal Support](https://www.mangobibo.com/get-started-legal-support).

> Once you start getting more calls than you can handle yourself you would want to look into getting a receptionist. The problem with hiring in office receptionist is you have sick days, people quitting, hiring and training costs etc. plus you have the issue of after hour calls needing to be answered.

So you really want to put a focus on call answering once you get to that point because that will boost your profitability. A lot of firms lose money simply because they lost new potential clients which can be as simple missing incoming calls.

> It sounds like you don't have anything lined up in the US. So why "quit" as opposed to just telling them you cannot work during that period? 

I would tell them that you really enjoy working there, that you are getting married and moving to the US and will be unable to work due to visa restrictions from \[date\] to \[date\], and that you'd like to resume working for them after that period ends, and ask them if they would be okay with that. You can always quit later if/when you find a different job.

As far as how much notice to give them, that depends on a number of factors. 

If you have a contract with them, that could require you to give a certain amount. 

How much will your absence affect them and how easily could you be replaced? 

For example, say you are 1 of 2 receptionists, you could probably be replaced relatively quickly and the other receptionist could cover in the meantime. In that situation, 2 weeks' notice would be more than adequate. On the other hand, the last time I left a firm, I ended up giving a month's notice because there would have been real problems if I left two weeks before certain hearings were about to start. As long as 2-weeks' notice wouldn't create real problems for them, they shouldn't be upset with 2 weeks.

How important is this income to you? 

It's always possible that if you tell them you're leaving, they'll fire you. Depending on how badly you need the income, you may not want to risk that.

> I use my case
I’ve never even heard of the program that you use, but I’m going to check it out. I’m happy with mycase, but it can’t hurt to see what you’re using. 

I think you’re in estate planning. If so, you should reach out to divorce lawyers in the area that you service. Explain to them that once their clients are divorced they’ll need a new estate plan. (obviously you have to focus on the divorce lawyers that service the middle-class and upper class.) offer them a referral fee. I imagine you’ll get a fair amount of work.

I’m curious as to why you need Lexis. I’m not throwing any shade. I mean it’s an honest question. Estate planning law changes slowly. I run a family law firm 82.7% of our time is spent on Paternity, Divorce, and family law post judgment order modification. The rest is spent doing estate planning for our middle and upper class clients post judgment. 

I read what used to be called the advanced sheets— that is the appellate cases and state Supreme Court cases relevant to family law as they come out. They are free and I’m sure they’re free in your state too. On September 1, 2024 my state, California, modified the algebra equation we use to calculate child support. Legal news reported it six months before it happened so no surprises for us.

Depending on how much you’re earning the 350 you’re gonna be paying for Lexus could be significant and might be a cost you can do without

I found that if you focus on a certain area such as estate planning or family law, the amount of new laws very modest and as a result, Alexis or West law subscription is unnecessary  (using fastlaw) to ensure any cases you cite are up-to-date (ie Shepardize the cases).

I’m very interested in your virtual legal assistant. And I’d love it if you had the time too expand on that either on this post or DM. I have four experience, legal assistance and office manager one real receptionist +4 virtual receptionists that we pay for as an expense words I don’t give them 1099s. 

I love my virtual receptionists. I’ve made an effort to get to know them and to be interested in them at least superficially and they really do a great job for us. The way we have it set up. Is potential clients go to me or to the office manager. and we can switch that up on the fly. My unique sales proposition is that I have a lot of litigation experience,  so I’m in court three days out of five. But I don’t always have to spend the entire day there. Plus our court takes a lunch break from 12 to 130 during which I spent a portion of my time prepping the parties and witnesses for the second half of the day and a portion of my time returning calls.

I think it’s important that the owner of the firm takes client calls often.   I’m personable. I speak plainly and I am the person who is best able to judge whether the client is a good fit.

> “Outsourcing” is a vague term. That’s why this question can’t be answered. 

Potential meanings of outsourcing:

* what you said, giving work to firm B when you have too much work
* hiring temporary attorneys to do legal work. There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work
* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn’t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly. Hiring a provider to answer your phone can be much cheaper and be 24/7.
* you can outsource things like intake or generating social media posts/blog posts, etc.

> -Put together your resume and reach out over LinkedIn to folks you have worked with in the past. 

You were involved with litigation, right? Perhaps there’s some opposing firms you liked working with and could see yourself moving to. Chat them up and see if there’s opportunities for you. This isn’t the only game in town. Even if things aren’t bad, you still progressed from receptionist to paralegal and your skill set has grown. It’s perfectly normal for folks to find a new job to continue growing their career a year or so after a promotion.

-Regarding the device security, I’d suggest to them they need to give you a device owned by the firm. 

Also, don’t install any MDM stuff because they will erase everything on your laptop/phone if and when they fold the firm or you leave- regardless of whether it’s your or their device. Also, you probably don’t want to have the liability of keeping your device secure “enough”.

If they can’t afford a MacBook M2 Air or a $1k Costco laptop it’s a pretty good signal they really are out of money. They may be looking for ways to control access to client files very soon.

> I rent from Regus/MyHQ which had been great.  Very comporable rates with other space in the area but actually lower since all utilities are included and we all share a receptionist.  I get a nice big kitchen area with appliances and up to 2 hours per day in a meeting room also included.  It also has all the necessary office machines in case mine ever goes down.  There is a much larger nicer meeting room with all the trimmings but that you have to pay for.  Reasonable rate.  Perfect for me because the free room is quite large.  Would only need the bigger room in the case of a full deposition that would go longer than two hours.  

But they also have flexibility.  If you need more soace they have bigger offices so you would be moving next door not across town.  Or you can add on smaller offices or release some you already have to downsize.  You can also use their facilities anywhere.  So I can pop in and use a meeting room in the next county if need be.  They are all over the place.  

That is at least one option to look into.

Entity registration: 250
Malpractice insurance: 1500 annually 
Web/branding/photos: 5000 one time - no maintenance or SEO needed 
45k working capital LOC: 600 lender fees
Openphone: 275 annually
Adobe: 15/mo
Clio: 35/mo
Office 365: 7/mo
Quick books: 17/mo intro rate 
Remote receptionist: 15/mo
Square space: 15/mo

I splurged on the website bc I’m using a client. You can do your own for like 50/100 bucks and get a logo on fiverr or something.

I plan to buy a Lenovo laptop or something g similar from Costco for $500 or so in the near future. 

I’m working from home and using conference space at my accountant’s office if ever needed. Most of my meetings and closings are remote. 

I’m probably missing something but that’s a good start. I have about 30k in cash set aside to draw on until I generate steady revenue.

However, the cost justification for small law firms isn't based on volume; it's about how quickly we need to respond. The average case value is between $10,000 and $50,000. Our system pays for itself the first time it handles a missed after-hours call, which occurs regularly when the receptionist leaves at 5 PM.

> I still do free consults, but as soon as someone mentions "quick question," "free," "small problem," I say that the purposes of the consult is to ensure that our firm can help with their issue, then briefly describe how we might approach such a case to make sure we're a good fit for the client.  Then say something like, my professional liability insurance provider would not like me to review documents or provide legal advice without a signed engagement agreement. 

Yesterday, I had a call where the client wanted me to review and agreement and tell them how to get out of their obligations.  I gave them my speech and they say, "we definitely don't want to engage a lawyer or pay for this."  OK, if things change and you would like to engage a lawyer, feel free to call me back.

If they do have a question or issue that isn't worth engaging an attorney and I can point them to some helpful resources or give some general guidance in five minutes, I'll do that.  

Hard cap of 15 minutes and calls only, unless this person is almost certainly going to turn into a paying client.  My receptionist screens out people outside of our practice area, but even if she thinks they're a bit crazy/unserious, I want to talk with them.  Cut them off at 5 minutes if they're disrespectful, "sorry, too busy/not my practice/whatever, here's the phone number for the bar association's lawyer referral service."

> As someone who was at a small firm way longer than I should have been, the equal bonus amongst staff was always leaving me on a sour note. As the highest biller (sometimes bringing in more than senior attorneys) and getting the same bonus as the file clerk and receptionist - it made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. It also felt horrible when law clerks and associates would get sometimes a bonus that equaled a partner share - when a lot of their billable hours were written off and mine was always charged. Not to mention - no raises. 

I always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. 

When a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. 

Remember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. 

Just my thoughts!

> Not a lawyer, but I’ve used them a bunch over the years, both personally and for our businesses.

In 2018 I was sued over lease hold agreement. This was the landlord for commercial building that my business was renting and leased for several years. He was suing us because he changed the terms of the lease about two years into attend your lease he did not ask he did not offer: he demanded and proclaimed that they were changing and we had no choice.  

The attorney I was using at that time was in her third year with a local firm. At one point about two months after the first service, something happened at the Law Firm and the next time I called to talk to her the receptionist or secretary sent me to a different attorney who told me that he was taking over the case because she was no longer with that firm. I asked him if her departure had anything to do with any of our current work, to which he replied no. 

Once we started talking about the next response, it was obvious that not only had he not read the case file, he incorrectly summarized what he had read, and wasn’t at all interested in listening. 

Once I hung up with him, I called my former attorneys cell phone, and asked her how she th was doing. We spoke for about 10 minutes, and at that time, she was very adroit at never even implying or allowing inference through omission that there was anything untoward at her former firm.

Before the call, I told her that I wasn’t entirely certain about my comfort with the new council, but I wasn’t sure about the ethics, and politics,… We are a rather small town… surrounding whether she might be able to take up my case again. 

That night, one of our friends who has a relative who works at the old Law Firm said that not only was our attorney gone, but one of the senior partners was gone, and there had been a  settlement with my attorney having to do with something “not right” happening between the senior partner and her. 

TLDR: IANAL but I will definitely follow any attorney I’m working with -who I trust - if they leave a firm while they’re working on one of my cases.  

Preempt: I’ve never initiated a lawsuit, although I have counter-sued. most of the words that I have for attorneys is contractual and or mineral rights associated.

> **Answering Your Question:**

Be optimisic. It's hard to tell over text, but I feel like the tone you're asking the question in is a frustrated one. High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.

Some of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:

* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.
* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.
* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level. This is normal and required an atitidue adjustment on my part to get the most out of my internship. Understand you're not being treated poorly, the things they're trying to teach you are likely just very different from anything you've ever worked with.

I'd also like to clarify that the I began work for the firm I am with now while I was in high school, so I understand your position. In my direct experience, you have to get your foot in the door doing absolute grunt work and then go from there. Through an ICE program, I was the morning receptionist at out main location for about 6 months until they could hire someone full-time. It wasn't until that point that I was given a position I actually enjoyed. 

Now a year later, I'm about to start college and the dynamic I have with the firm is beggining to change. It just takes time.



**Some general advice for starting a career before you have an undergrad degree:**

Once you have your foot in the door, set yourself apart. I took tons of side-projects while also doing reception work, typically on the bussiness management side, and our managing partner started to lean on me to deal with some of the administrative things he didn't enjoy. 

With resumes, I also recommend you follow the guides listed by top universities. I did tons of unpaid work on political campaigns before this position, which wasn't fun but beefed up my resume and gave me real-world experience. When creating my resume, I based it off the placement office resources at Indiana University, Harvard University, and MIT. Your resume should absolutely be a single page. I'd be happy to send you mine if you do want a reference. Timing is also important. Push your resume to as many firms as you can.

> Not trying to be a jerk, but I would dissuade you from this course of action. The fact that you “love to argue about the law” and are interested in crime and politics are really not good reasons to go spend three+ years and a bunch of money only to get spit out low on the totem pole into a grueling and largely unfulfilling profession where you have like a 10% chance at finding something that even somewhat resembles your expectation of what lawyers do.

If you are serious about this, and this is a thoroughly well thought out plan where you understand the cost/benefit, I would make SURE you shadow some attorneys first. Not the glamorous side of the job, but actually try to see under the hood. Maybe even take a part time gig as a receptionist or assistant at a small law firm for a few months on your non-nursing days. I think you will be surprised at what you find. Just like nursing is not like Grey’s Anatomy, law is not like Suits.

> TL;DR: You can go solo and there are TONS of ways to do so! 

  
Meh. It depends. You can work up to an easy solo "Ronin" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  

You can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do "DSS Defense" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).

The worst part (for me) is the "running a business" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a "brick and mortar" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that "Gen-X Joke" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  


The #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  


14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)

> How well the firm did over the year, how much cash they have on hand at the end of the year, and how much they value the person getting the bonus.  

I've heard of small plaintiff's firms that landed a huge verdict doling out BIG bonuses to everyone - not just associates.  If you work in a firm with three attorneys and five staffers and the firm gets (for example) a $5 million fee, I could totally see them giving the five staffers $25K+ bonuses.  That's a drop in the bucket with a fee that big, but it could be life-changing for a receptionist making $50K per year.

> Your age is not an issue.  Your GPA will be an issue for getting into a law school, but you're probably already knocked out of consideration of the higher ranked schools (I had a 2.7 coming out of college and was in the lowest quarter of my entering class).

I generally try to dissuade people from going to law school mainly because the price tag isn't worth it.  Most people coming out of law school are not going to have jobs that earn enough money to live and pay back the monstrous loans.  Those that are capable of paying their loans take on extremely soul-sucking jobs to do so.  

The apprenticing model in California requires you to work in a lawyer's office.  If you're interested at all, I would try to find a non-attorney job (like a paralegal or investigator) to get into an office and show you what the industry is like.  My first job out of college was as a receptionist for a small law firm in Boston.  I did go on to law school, but never landed a "real" law job afterwards and now I do compliance for the Federal Government.  It took almost twenty years after graduating to get to a comfortable spot.  Not lucrative, but comfortable.

1. Vonage Business integrates directly with Clio to the point that a phone call auto logs into the billing entry and adds the contact if they are in there. Really convenient for auto billing every phone call. 

2. Don’t know. We use old school receptionist

3. We use Google workplace as our main server and email, Microsoft office suite, quick books. Also, give faster suite a try. It’s a really neat Clio integration. It’s a little pricey but works well. Zoom integration works. Zapier is great for automation. 

4. Don’t know, don’t use Clios trust account. 

5. Google loves organic content. Make sure you have your local Google maps set up, write good blog posts to generate valuable content, have clients leave Google reviews. I tried to learn Google AdWords. It’s hard to do on your own and you can blow your budget without the proper skill. Hire a great SEO person who can put your money to work.

> Well, one of the advantages of dealing with clients at weekends is that you can raise the price. For example, if you have an ice cream shop, instead of closing it at night, keep it open at night but raise the prices because of the timing. So it's better if you deal with clients on weekends.

Even if you can't, you can integrate AI to deal with clients using AI tools such as AI Front Desk.

> This is tricky but I can share some industry standards.

For my clients I recommend considering 70% “at capacity“ If you have fewer than ten employees. (Contractors don’t count because they aren’t fixed costs). 

That’s about 30 hours a week per billable employee. 

This is not just to allow work that isn‘t billable, it’s to put some slack in your schedule to better respond to clients and opportunities. its hard to respond if you are at 100% utilization. 

Now not all employees are billable. For example, a receptionist or bookkeeper, CFO, etc. 

That gives you your rough ceiling. If the founder only spends half their time on billable work, you account for that (15 hrs a week). 

So 6 hours a day for production people is “at capacity” 4.85 is low. 

Another issue is timekeeping. Time keeping will always lag behind ACTUAL TIME spent on billable work because people forget to enter time for small things - multiply that five minute email here and that 15 min internal client discussion X ten people = a lot of “lost” time. 

You are over staffed. One of the biggest and most expensive mistakes I made was not cutting staff fast enough. We would work on elaborate internal projects - great work but bad practice. 

Drive more billable hours or cut 1-2 people.

I’ve been exploring AI receptionists to help handle incoming calls and reduce missed opportunities for my small insurance office. Most of my callers hang up without leaving a voicemail, and it’s been a recurring issue during busy hours. 

I recently started using Sonant AI and it’s been a game changer. It answers instantly 24/7, and handles basic stuff like intake questions and appointment requests without missing a beat. And it sounds real and most people have no idea that it’s AI. It also integrates easily with the systems I already use which is just great.

That said, there are a ton of options out there like Smith AI, Dialzara, etc. but their pricing and features are all over the place. Has anyone done a deep dive or tested multiple tools? Curious what’s actually worked well for others in practice.

> Yo just saw this thread. DO NOT AND LET ME REPEAT DO NOT Listen to anyone who says "creating a new account" is the way to fix local services ads. This is a severely misguided suggestion from people who do not understand how LSA works. When LSA performance tanks its generally because Google has stopped serving LSA as much. Google has to walk a delicate balance with LSA while also keeping law firms who only run PPC ads getting leads. This is often the case when performance drops. LSA is a black box and Google can and does do whatever they want with it. This often means that sometimes performance will be WAYYY up, sometime performace will be way down. Then other times you will suddenly get off topic and out of geo leads. This is when they are testing keyword and geo expansions behind the scenes. The REAL answer to fix LSA is to also be running PPC and run these account in unison to reach your monthly goal. We break LSA accounts out from PPC account in our MCC so that we can see the fluctuations happening in real and make adjustments to budgets between platforms. This is how the pro's do it, because you cant entirely trust a black box and you DEFINTELY should not trust anyone who says "Making a new account will fix it" this is just PURE NONSENSE!!!!!

The traditional answering services were eating into our budget at like $3-4 per minute, and half the time they'd mess up the initial screening anyway.

From what I've researched, the tech has gotten pretty solid especially the ones that can actually qualify leads and integrate directly with your practice management system. We've been testing out getserva.ai since they're doing a 30-day free trial right now, and honestly it's been handling our intake calls way better than I expected for just $149/month.

> cell providers are (at least Verizon and AT&T)  flagging tons of businesses as spam that are not. 

You say you have a verizon MVNO, even if you replicated the issue you are out of luck.  They will not, cannot,  help you.  

You need a test line with one or all of the big 3 that is having the issue.  NVNO do not have the ability to escalate tickets to people who can help.  That is the point of the NVNO, that is why they are cheap.

Threaten your provider with moving to a different carrier. 

If they can't help, then look at the cost to move to a big carrier.  

Verizon business isn't absolutely awful, not fantastic, and customers get lost in the shuffle, and maybe don't get the best support on issues.  

Get a sales quote from a couple providers.  Take that to your provider.  Tell them to fix it or you are going to cancel.

Your provider may do some poor practices, like not validate calling numbers against their customers accounts, thus allowing a customer to outpulse any number they want.  This is a big no no.  They might have a large number of customers with auto dialers.  Could be lots of things.  It could be the big companies are using stir shaken as an excuse to screw over small low cost providers by rating their trust as low and flagging calls as spam.

Track all the issues you have, emails, and support calls to your provider.  If you are under contract you will need maybe six or so attempts at working with your provider documented to get out of paying ETF for breaking any contracts you are under.  Contracts can always be broken, you just need examples of how the provider is not providing a quality service.  It doesn't matter that caller id is not guaranteed or that service quality is not in the contract.  Any provider giving bad service will let you out of a contract rather than deal with government fines.

If you really want to keep your provider then file a complaint with your states utility commission.  Every state has one or more departments that take resident complaints about utilities.  And these departments have POWER.  Providers mess with them and suddenly no permits for doing any work on poles, no permits for expansions. 

If you have documented tickets and they want to charge ETF, a report to the FTC will clear that up immediately.  You need good documented tickets.  You need to work with your provider in good faith. If they call you back, answer the calls.  If they want test calls then you make them.  Filing a complaint is not a free service/pay no fees card.

You can complain to the FCC's consumer complaint.  Last I knew these were slower to get worked due to the volume of reports they get.  I know some really nice helpful people at the FCC, but waiting weeks for your ticket to reach the top of the que sucks.

> This question was secretly and silently deleted years ago by some mod for some unexplained reason shortly after I posted it. 

Purely to make the original question viewable, I've pasted the original text below. 

I am no longer looking for answers to my questions. No response is needed if you happen to stumble upon this post in 2023 or later.

----

I've actually installed asterisk on my work box, edited a dial plan, sent commands to a ATA, etc* so maybe I'm not a total n00b, but I'm at a loss on where to go to get started.

Currently: I have two prepaid cellphones. One with a number that I've had for 10+ years, so I want to keep it. I cut the copper landline years ago, and probably I can't go back. (Because...) I have FiOS at home (...and I doubt they would want to hook up the copper again). I have several boxes at home and would not be adverse to making up a new box running linux or BSD to run 24/7 as my answering machine/ forwarding box/ etc.

I want to ease in to this because I'm currently job hunting. The truth is that these prepaid phones kinda suck. Sometimes I don't get  my voice mail notification promptly. I do pay less than $12/month for the prepaid plan though. I don't make a lot of calls, but I do need to be accessible.

My rough plan of action would go something like this:

1. Get VoIP service from a provider and a new local phone number.

2. Build a box to run at home 24/7 to store phone messages, custom dial plans (ex-girlfriend and others), and manage a desktop VoIP phone that plugs in via ethernet (which I have not purchased yet). Probably no analog POTS phones at all unless it is a super cheap option vs getting a digital desk phone off ebay.

3. Forward my new phone number so it rings my two cell phones and my desk phone at work (during certain hours) at the same time, and takes messages if I don't answer (emails me an mp3 of the message, etc..)

4. Port my 10 year cell number over to my VoIP provider once everything is stable and to my liking.

5. (optional) Buy a used Android phone off ebay, flash firmware if needed, and use it without a cell plan for calls over wi-fi to my home asterisk box.

I saw a message a few weeks ago that offered advice for picking a provider, but what I'm really lacking is the VoIP lingo I need to intelligently evaluate what a provider can do for me.  **So (tl;dr) step 1 is probably "What do I need to look for with a VoIP provider in relationship with what I want to do as outlined above?"**

*(this was actually done to simulate a user picking up a phone, dialing numbers, etc. It allowed me to write scripts to do automated regression testing on work's souper seekret phone related box. So I'm perhaps not a total n00b but have zero experience with some aspects of routing SIP calls over the net, providers, etc.)

> Real talk: The traditional "find a mentor" approach rarely works. Here's what actually works:



\*\*1. Reverse mentorship\*\*



Instead of asking "will you mentor me?", lead with value:

\- Share insights from your recent experiments

\- Introduce them to potential clients/partners

\- Contribute to their content/projects



I've built stronger relationships by helping experienced folks with things they don't have time for (research, testing tools, community management) than by directly asking for mentorship.



\*\*2. Specific, not general\*\*



Don't ask: "Can you mentor me?"

Ask: "I'm struggling with pricing my productized service. You mentioned charging $X for similar work - what metrics did you use to land on that number?"



People love answering specific questions. It's the vague "pick your brain" requests that get ignored.



\*\*3. Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn threads\*\*



Honestly, you're doing it right now. Posting questions, getting feedback from multiple experienced people > one formal mentor. I've learned more from:

\- r/agency discussions

\- Indie Hackers threads

\- Product Hunt comment sections

\- LinkedIn posts with real numbers



...than from any formal mentorship.



\*\*4. Build in public\*\*



Share your journey publicly. When I started posting about what I was building and the problems I faced, experienced founders reached out to me offering advice. The mentorship found me.



\*\*5. Paid communities/masterminds\*\*



Sometimes it's worth paying $50-500/month to join communities where successful agency owners hang out. The ROI from one good insight > the membership cost.



\*\*Reality check:\*\*



Most "mentors" are just people who figured things out slightly before you did. They're not wizards. Read their content, apply their frameworks, ask specific questions when stuck. That's 90% of what formal mentorship would give you anyway.



The best mentor is launching, failing, iterating, and sharing what you learn.

> I’m a vet by degree, but vets didn’t need new business 2 years ago.

So I purchased a database subscription and picked a niche to cold call for 3 days to do market research. Did that for a month.

Was watching YouTube at the same time and ended up on Medspas. Found my first client a couple weeks after that.

Then it took me 10 months to find the Medspa service I would hyper niche on. Before that, I was testing different offers for the spas, trying to close packages for them over the phone so I could see the market’s reaction.

This month is actually a year since we found our hyper niche. Found it in October, fired all of our clients who either couldn’t participate or didn’t want to in Nov and haven’t looked back.

It really is all about saying “no”. A once in a lifetime opportunity comes every 6 months. The reason why I don’t really worry about my competition, is I know 99% of them lack focus and/discipline to say no.

I’ve had referrals that were doing 3x in adspend compared to all of my clients combined. The guy literally told me, “I will pay any amount of money for you to do for me what you’ve done for her.” The answer was No from me, didn’t even have to think about it. He didn’t fit my micro niche requirements.

Now I have a single client who does more than 3x what he does.

> Personal take: websites are a tool. Just about anyone can build a website via squarespace or whatever. Now, it definitely won’t be the same quality as what a web developer could build. But most of these businesses will have some sort of expectation that this website will benefit them in some way. Getting people to sign up for their subscriptions, bringing more customers through the door, etc. In the long run, I would look for ways to add more value on top of a website. Social media services, ad campaigns, and the like. 

As for your original question, make sure you’re networking with people and letting them know what you do. All my best clients have been through referrals. The other typical answer you’ll receive is to target businesses with no website, or outdated website. These can be hard sells, because the owner may not see the value in having a website built or upgraded. So you need to offer and portray additional value, however that may be. Maybe you add a contact form that sends contact form messages right to a CRM (not as difficult as it may sound). Maybe you integrate something from DoorDash into the website. Maybe you build a few different landing pages and do some A/B testing. Just find a way to add value for your clients.

Clutch is $125 / month so if it brings you a single client that pays >$750 after 6 months it's worth it. Seems like a reasonable bet to make at least as a test.

FWIW I don't think that monthly fee is the real cost - you need to commit to succeed on any of these platforms. Offer services for free or cheap, collect plenty of good testimonials and ratings, etc. That takes time and effort way beyond what you pay the platform.

> The niche doesn't need to be high ticket.  The level of output your agency performs just needs to align with the niche.

Example:
We're a $500k agency with packages at $750/mo for SEO and Google Ads.

We serve all landscaping and lawn care clients.

A competitor of mine ONLY serves landscaping and lawn care clients over $1m in revenue and has minimum monthly packages of $10k that includes about $5k in adspend. 

He doesn't serve my market because I have lots of clients between the $100k and $1m mark as well as clients over $1m and even $10m.

However, my solution is a lotnless comprehensive than his. We do less work and thus charge less money to tap the undeserved market.

Regarding picking a niche, it doesn't necessarily need to be something you enjoy but you do have to learn to enjoy it.

My partner gave the example that you could be into video games and at your dentist you and your dentist start talking about video games. The conversation could lead to you talking about your agency youre starting and using him as a test client. Suddenly you get into the dentist niche.

I also suggest looking at the market cap of that niche. If it's a small market cap you're going to hit market saturation faster.

You also need to consider how much your potential client will make off of one customer. Then take how many customers you think you can help deliver to the client and divide it by your costs. Are they still profitable on a per client basis?

If the answer is no, then either you need to adjust your pricing, strategy, or that niche can't support what you're offering.

If you consider scuba, consider that all of your clients are likely going to be on the coasts.

Do you also offer services to competitors? If not you could hit saturation pretty quick.

Mixing skydiving would be good a good option as you have all of the inland space to avoid total saturation.

So if you do scuba and skydiving... your niche is really "Excursions"

And that opens you up to other things like white water rafting companies, zip line companies, and so much more.

But I would recommend just sticking with the two until you build up a solid base of those clients.

Then, some people will read this comment, and say "wow, this guy really knows his stuff." Then they'll go to my profile and start reading my posts and my other comments. 

Then they DM me and say, "hey I really liked what you wrote about X and I have Y problem. Can we set up a time to see if you'd be a good fit to take on this project?"

While everyone is acting like they're too fucking important to help other people--It's all I do. People think helping others is low ROI. These people don't understand how people buy AT ALL. 

I don't even purposely intend to generate prospects and it just happens naturally. I was so active on Reddit at one point, I was generating 3 calls per day as a freelancer.

I wrote this comment once about the Google Ads algorithm and how bandit testing prevents accurate A/B testing because bandit testing combines the exploration and exploitation phases of the experimentation process.

I made $90,000 in attributable revenue from that single comment in consultation fees alone--not even retainers.

> I think the answer to your question depends on what you are looking for. As with other services, you need to decide the balance that is right for you between cost of the service and its quality. As a rule, the cheaper the VoIP service, the less the provider cares about call quality and customer service. Some years back I had a negative experience with a cheap VoIP provider (now out of business) that gave me an unreliable connection and poor call quality. I recommend you only use a provider that only gives their clients premium internet call routes, even if the charges are a little higher than others.

> 1/2

First things first you have to ask yourself - why would someone buy a website from you? When they ask what you do that’s better, what are you gonna say? When they ask about SEO and ranking better and what you do for that, what are you gonna say? What problems are you solving for them? What is wrong with their current site, why is it wrong, how do you fix it, and why are you uniquely able to fix it? Sales is the first Hurdle for most developers. It’s not easy. It’s a whole other way of thinking and now you have to talk to people, be personable, knowledgeable, and navigate the conversation skillfully to close the sale. It’s not about the website or their old one looking bad. It’s about what problems you solve. People buy solutions. And if you don’t have any, you won’t sell very much. So you need to work on that. What is your unique selling point, what do you do better than anyone else, and what problems you are solving for them and why it’s a problem. And if all you’re doing is slinging cheap crappy Wordpress themes then you are no better than Raj in Pakistan charging $200 on fiver. You can’t compete and you won’t solve any problems, which means you won’t get referrals or repeat business because your websites just sit there like their old ones did. It looks better. But they have no traffic and no conversions. Why? If you can’t answer that question then you aren’t ready to start.

Also Focus on how to use flexbox and grid, transforms, transitions, mobile first coding, positioning, differences between display block and Inline block, etc. very important to have the basics mastered.

I HIGHLY recommend finding a good designer to work with. You can find good ones for $20 an hour in Asia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. They’re amazing out there. My guy in Bangladesh is the core of my design team. I gave him a raise to $25 an hour. And once we keep growing I’m bumping that up too and taking care of them nicely. Design is hard. I try to do it myself sometimes, but it’s always just easier having someone better at it than you so you can focus on the things you do better and are more productive at. You’ll be glad you did.

Then there’s pricing!

I have two packages:

I have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance

or $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc.

$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself.

Lump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.

Nice, simple pricing. Simple projects. No databases. No booking features. No payment processing. Wanna know why? Because you don’t have to build everything yourself. There’s so many third party services out there that do niche specific booking services and perfected it for you. Just have your client set up a few demos with some companies and find the one that works best for them, their company rep will help

> They are out there but they'll make up an extremely small percentage of your clients. It's always funny when you make a post like this and the majority of the comments are from randoms saying "The problem is you! If you on board better all your clients will be perfect and pay you forever and never become a bad client!" Those people must not live in the real world, and must not own an agency because it's simply not true. 

  
The truth is, most clients are a nightmare. I recently had a client who I gelled with very much. Everything going great, lead volume up and costs down month after month. One day, out of the blue, he emails me and says "We need to pause everything after this month, we're putting our marketing money somewhere else" 

The last day of our service, he goes in and flips my campaign back on that I turned off. He just wanted to run our ads and not pay us to manage them. 

Then you have the clients where you think everything is going well, you're meeting your goals consistently. Providing WEEKLY reporting that proves it, and their friend who lives on the other side of the country looks at their ads and says "I know someone who can do it better than your current agency" BOOM - you're fired instantly without a single second of notice. 

Then you'll have the ones who hire their niece who's in high school to follow up with the leads. She calls the leads one time, 2 weeks after the lead signed up, lead doesn't answer the phone. Then little suzy goes and tells the owner of the business the leads suck. BOOM! Fired!

Or how about Mr Pest control company that hires your agency to rank them on page one of Google, you fulfill your promise and rank them on page one for ALL their keywords. Then you get the email, hey thanks for getting us ranked! We need to pause for a month and we'll get back to this. BOOM! Fired and ghosted. 

  
Or what about the client that hires you, and when you're building out there campaign, you go into the Google drive folder that you gave them a week ago to upload images and videos to be used for ads. The folder's empty, you email the client and ask for content. She says she will provide it next week. Next week the folder is still empty. You email her again and remind her you need content. She emails you back and says she's 33 weeks pregnant and doesn't feel like dealing with this. She says she's paying you enough money and you should be able to find content yourself (stock photos). You reply and tell her that we can of course use stock photos, but the ads won't perform as well that way. She replies and tells you that she wants a refund. 

  
These are just a couple examples of what we deal with on a weekly basis. For anyone blaming you and saying that all clients are perfect and will pay you on time every month with no complaints until they day the die so long as your onboarding call was up to par, doesn't actually have significant clients and has probably worked with a couple clients as a side gig over the course of th

> Yo....  So...

How does ICE know where people work?   Because It's on their I-9 form.   When ICE shows up to an address with a list of names?   Those people are hired on a I-551, I-776, or I-94 form.  They pass E-Verify, and are documented legal employees.   Who under executive order are being subject to extrajudicial revokation of legal status and removed from the United States, or detained, or shipped to El Salvador.   Lots of options there.

The key word here is documented with legal status.  That's why ICE knows where they live and work.  Because the have legal documents.

The undocumented / illeagals are a totally different story.   That being said if you want to wash dishes, dig ditches, work in a slaughter house or do agricultural labor, there's not enough illeagals to fill those jobs and they will take you.  I've met some of the owners.  They take anyone with a pulse same day, and can never find enough people.

Back to subject at hand.  

This is R/consulting.  So if you can't talk the talk why would anyone take you seriously.  

Lovely troll comments.

But when I file a change order or contract claim for $2,000,000 of labor costs due to a site shut down from an ICE Raid on on of my projects that cost us a 2 day delay and a million dollars a day of labor?  And now we have further delays and ICE related litigation. Between Owner, Prime Contractor, 3 dozen subcontractors, internal and external legal counsel, not to mention a dozen consulting firms on different sides of the problem?

Like just sorting out that mess is a full time job for like 6 people for at least a year.  Been there, actually have the t-shirt.   Which is another million dollars or more in service labor costs.

Then say legal action - jeez, now the lawyers cost another million on each side just to explain to the executives and shareholders there's nothing they can do other than accept it, pay for it and move on.

So end result is several million dollars of extra cost in ICE disruption remediation.  Not to mention the weeks of overtime, missed family time, closed door arguments, and meetings.

All because ICE showed up in Masks and Guns, and decided to Revoke the working Visas of a security Gaurd and a Junior electrician that were I-551 or I-776  legal immigrants with Federal Employement Authorisation.   And the wrong tatoos.

So legal counsel is basically telling me the best strategy to deal with ICE is basically to hide them, keep them quiet, and give them whatever they ask for as quickly and quietly as possible, as to save the millions of dollars of problems that happen when masked guys with guns roll up on the security gate.

Seriously.  According to ICE statistics Last year over 200,000 immigrants were peacefully and quietly removed from the United States with Due Process and NOBODY CARED.  The news media didn't care, none of us knew it was happening or didn't worry about it.

Like 2 dudes in suits show up with badges and a warrant; we have a 5 minute chat, call in the p

> I'd use a BATNA type of thinking. If you don't agree to their offer, what's likely to happen? Do you walk with essentially the same payout but no noncompete? Then you have negotiation room. In the opposite extreme, do you get no severance, and you actually signed a binding noncompete when you started the job? Then you're sorta stuck.

As an alternative to trying to get an attorney consult, if free is not an option and you doubt it's worth it, I just tried and for my jurisdiction ChatGPT gave a - to the best of my knowledge - accurate answer when asked what were requires as well as usual practice severance practices for professional services professionals.

I then asked it, again with the context of my jurisdiction, what would be an appropriate adjustment for a 12 month noncompete, given 18 months job tenure, and it said "a few months" extra severance. I have no idea if that's reasonable, but you doing the same experiment with your own jurisdiction in the question you ask your favorite genAI may guide you whether it's worth paying a lawyer to explore further.

> Congrats on your first client! Honest advice: stop boosting posts. From my exerpeicne it rarely converts for law firms.

Instead, start Local SEO immediately. This is your long-term engine. It involves:

* Google Business Profile (GBP): The core element. It puts you in the "Map Pack" for local searches (e.g., "lawyer near me").
* Citations: Listing your firm in directories.
* Reviews: Social proof.

PPC (Google Ads/Local Services Ads) buys instant visibility at the top of search results but requires a budget.  We often see smaller practices and solos try to compete here initially and waste budget due to a lack of ability to answer the phone in time and convert. Since funds are tight, invest into your GBP now. SEO takes months to mature; starting today builds your future pipeline.

For the GBP if you have a physical location, you'll have the best chance of ranking for target search terms. Then it's a matter of building the reviews. While you have some time, I'd also recommend you build a YouTube channel and start answering questions on video. You would not believe the power this has in terms of marketing in a world where every answer is AI. 

  
Best of luck and feel free to reach out any time if you have law firm marketing questions.

> A few recommendations for you. Full disclosure, I'm a digital marketing agency owner in the DC area and one of our niches is working with law firms. I don't currently work with a PI law firm, but happy to speak to my experience in general with magazine advertising. 

My advice about magazines:

I've seen very few investments where the return on investment (ROI) was positive or even good. That said, I'm all for people trying something new as long as they measure it!

How to measure magazine results: 1) tracking phone number 2) QR code where link clicks and submissions or calls are tracked.

  
What I do know about PI and other law specialities from the ABA's marketing report:

First to answer the phone wins the lead

A solution for this that I use personally: Blazeo. On my website (https://bluehuki.com/) you can try out the chat and you can call the number and they will answer 24/7. When I was thinking about adding on the phone service they had PI examples that were great - did a full case intake. I will say that for both services they are a fraction of the cost of hiring someone to do it.  They also offer other languages if that is a need too.

Highly recommend just us⁤ing an answering service that specializes in law firms. Don't use a generic one that answers for tons of industries.

It's the difference between a significant amount of heavy lifting setting up a call center vs snapping your fingers and having people answering the phone professionally in a day.

Not to mention it's less than 1/10 of the cost. I found this company called Inside Out Law Calls last year, and I've been working with them since.

> If you were a client of mine (former marketing and operations executive for law firms, and now have my own company), I would have a couple recommendations. 

Those services can work, but I would do two things. One, narrow your focus to a niche that you feel your USP (unique selling proposition) will drive referrals from other attorneys. This can be your proverbial “bread and butter”, and still take other Misc type of cases while you’re building your practice. Two, once you have that niche, create the best way to sell that value. Once you have those knocked out you can start networking with other law firms and it will create a better flow of cases than will help you create sustainable growth. 

Keep your client acquisition costs as low as possible, while also building sustainability. If you get some cash inflows for marketing, then have a marketing medium lined up that will allow you to bring in some leads quickly. Now, even with that I would generate those only for the cases that fit the first point I made. 

Happy to answer any questions about that if you DM me. 

Wish you well!

> So, I kind of do a hybrid. California family law. I’ve been on my own for about 2.5 years and was at a firm before that. 

I will say that I do zero advertising. I am currently (knock on wood) 100% word of mouth referrals. Back when I was at a firm, we did paid advertising and 100% paid consults. While I didn’t handle the intake calls (we had an office manager for that) I do know that we charged $475 for a 1 hour consult and that a lot of the potential clients from the paid services dropped off when they heard about the cost. Great! Fine. They probably wouldn’t pay anyway. 

Now I usually only do paid consults when I *don’t* know the potential client is coming from a good source. I know the source because, before I speak with anyone ever, I have them fill out an online intake form. The intake form isn’t just for conflict checks but also asks about salary, property and who referred them. If the potential new client refuses to fill it out, fine but we’re not talking unless and until they do. 

That said, I work with a number of entertainment lawyers, real estate lawyers, business managers and the like. Let’s say I did a divorce for Actor A two years ago and Actor A’s entertainment law attorney, John Smith, passed along my contact information to Actor B, who the entertainment lawyer also represents. I might see that Actor B wrote on their intake form that John Smith referred them. I’ll do that call for free because, almost invariably, I’m the only divorce attorney this person wants to bother contacting. Assuming I seem normal on the phone, 9/10 times, they’ll hire me by the end of the call. 

If I don’t know the referral source, I’ll take a look at what the potential client wants and what their resources look like based on answers to the intake questions. In the US, you can very easily look up addresses and home values on Redfin. If they live in a $7M single family home and they want a prenup, I probably won’t charge for a consult, because it’s probably a good case and the call is unlikely to take too much time. They probably just want to talk to someone professional and nice and check that box and be done with it. If I can’t read into the information on the intake form AND I don’t know the referral source, I’ll likely charge. 

All that said, I think those online referral things are absolute shit. You’re probably better off networking with other lawyers and advertising in a hyper local way. Other lawyers are a terrific resource because 1) when people need a family law attorney, they’re likely to ask for a referral from the only lawyer(s) they know and 2) if someone can afford the first lawyer, they can probably afford the second. Try meeting with trusts and estates lawyer, real estate lawyers and small business type lawyers. Get to know them so you’re the first person they’ll recommend when someone calls them and asks for a divorce referral. Secondly, hyper specific local advertising is probably the way I’d go if I did advertising. There’s an eleme

> With a single ad in a local directory and some worthwhile people referring or in your corner, you'll be just fine. Lawyers are always in demand, and the best ones are always  the ones with a life.

Dont get cornered into the perception of what a lawyer is expected to suffer thru with this or that person or firm. There are 12 lawyers in my family, and all worked for three years max before going solo practice. Solo practice means a hit some months with the rental space costs and if you need notary services etc, but a great- vetted- tactfully chosen- secretary means the time is wittled down significantly.

 If budgeting for reduced income at first, I highly recommend (at least for consults and contracts) time slots at office buildings instead of entire office rentals when meeting with clients. Depending on your law specialty, it can be awesome to be a solo lawyer- and the key in many places is your people. Your tech guy-  client info and seamless website, which is easily used on any device, and is set up to not allow junkmail. Internet reputation.

Answering service and proficient/ experienced secretary that can truly lighten the load with intake, and proper investment in software to automate many forms with template banks and support. 

Otherwise, work is easier when you get enough sleep and don't resent the hours spent watching your kids grow up at weekly dinners that are often spent half mentally dead from stress.

> There are some good answers here. I'll weigh in on the pricing of websites and SEO. There are two schools of thought. And typically, if you are paying for a monthly fee, you are still better off than a one-time set it and forget it with the website. The hosting, support, security, etc that comes with monthly is worth it - and you can get SEO bundled in. 

There are a few companies out there that can get real results for around $1k/month - possibly a little higher, but not much. The thing to understand here is they need to be doing actual work - what are the deliverables? The reason so many firms are burned about SEO is that it's easy to say you are "doing work" but not actually doing anything as many attorneys don't know or don't have the time to keep up with it. Companies I'm aware of in these price ranges that we've dealt with include: PaperStreet, Civille, MeanPug. These do have expanded services like link building, etc that are going to exceed the pricepoint above, but if that $1,000-$1,500/mo range is where you want to or need to live, results within 6 months with these real deliverables are possible (within reason). 

If you want to go all-out, while paying a lot more for services, I'd always recommend rankings io. Although, they do charge quite a bit more and largely work with PI firms. But they do a lot and have a pretty good track record. 

But yes, the $2500 and $199 after seems to be a race to the bottom kind of company - and you are going to get what you pay for there.

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu

> As a reseller of a UCaaS, all my subscribers have been using the SMS service as P2P and not encountered a problem.  

One of my customers decided to migrate out and later mentioned to me that they had to go through the Campaign Registry for all their numbers, even though it was clearly P2P usage.  This required them to update policies and websites and, had they known about thiis beforehand, they might not have left because the time and financial resources offset the cost savings they had hoped to see.

My friend, a reseller, had a customer send a flyer.  Did everything manually.  This flagged something because that number was not longer allowed to send SMS and had to go through a process to reenable the service which included campaign registry.

I ripped from the FAQ data (provider name redacted) at which I should consider recommending registry and have been told, when in doubt register.

This looks very much like a YMMV topic until everuyone gets the same sheet of music.

Question: What is the default use for X SMS?

Answer:X SMS features, which include the ability to text enabling a main company number (Company Messaging) and text enabling a user’s phone number, is designed and provisioned for Person-to-Person (P2P) messaging, meaning sending/receiving one message at a time with two-way (back and forth) communication between two human users.  This is different than Application-to-Person (A2P)/bulk texting.

Question: What is A2P or Bulk Texting?

Answer: Application-to-Person (A2P)/bulk texting consists mostly of outbound texts where the ratio of inbound messages is lower than 45%. This includes bulk campaign texting, marketing communications, one-way appointment reminders, notifications, etc. Businesses using this A2P/bulk texting are required to register with The Campaign Registry.

Answer: The Campaign Registry is an entity created by mobile network operators to help companies work within regulatory best practices for texting. Campaign Registration is an industry-wide initiative to prevent spam and improve your texting deliverability.  Click [here](https://support.intermedia.com/app/articles/detail/a_id/16843#bulk) for guidelines, information, and options for registering with The Campaign Registry.

> What you are asking for is very simple and easily done. 

The absolutely cheapest way to do this is to purchase something called a "SIP trunk" and run your own "PBX" whether that be a local system or in the cloud. However it is very important you get a qualified person to set it up and maintain it. This could be a higher initial outlay but a cheaper cost over time as you would just have your call and line rental charges for the most part and your maintainers fees, and you can have unlimited staff answering and making calls based on how many "lines" your SIP trunk came with.

The other way to do it is to purchase a managed phone service. This is more expensive over time as you will have a monthly fee per user. The costs are difficult to quantify as it will depend on the package and what exactly comes with it, but generally speaking its more expensive over time than running your own PBX but all the headaches are taken away from you (But they are kind of negated if you have a maintainer so its a juggle). The upsides to managed phone services is they often come with phone hardware as part of the package without having to lay out cash for phones, so you might have the benefit of physical phones at a spread out cost (They aren't free they get priced in over the lifetime of your contract).

We aren't allowed to make recommendations here but if you google "VOIP providers France" or "SIP trunk provider in France" it should get you going in the right direction.

> Sorry if this it TLTR.

Perhaps I am confused, but the responses appear to be recommending a softphone on your PC instead of a physical phone on your desk.  I don't see how that saves you any money.  You still have to pay for a phone service provider like Vonage, et al.

To answer your original question, yes, you can run a PHONE SERVER on cheap hardware at home. This is simple enough for someone who has been down that road, but darn tricky the first time through.  Issues:  Selecting which freeware software, 3CX, Asterisk and FreeSwitch are big ones.  Then you still have to have a provider who routes the calls to your server. Most of those providers are far cheaper than typical home service like Vonage and some can support going straight to a soft or hard phone. You may lose features like voice mail, you may not.

If you are a web developer type, check out TWILIO.COM - I am very happy there but I have a webserver to handle the custom routing and setup Voice Mail on.  If not, maybe look at VOIP.MS or 1000 others.  
  
If you try to put a "server" in your home without a statis IP address, you will likely have to update every time it changes. A far worse problem is dealing with NAT (network address translation) to your server behind a typical home router.  (NAT is the thing that allows lots of home devices to all share your ONE external IP address).  SIP (voip protocol) to/from a server that is NAT forwarding can be a nightmare resulting in lots of different problems: one way audio, outgoing calls only, no connection at all, everything works until your router's NAT connection times out, then no more inbound calls, calls drop after 5 or 10 minutes, etc. I had a very very bad time fighting NAT over the years. Granted things are much better now and the problem is not bad if the SERVER is not behind NAT and the phones are.

IMHO, you are better off using your time to make money (part time) or looking for a new job.  PM me with your skill set and location? Also, I have used Mint mobile for 3+ years at $15/month and I am completely satisfied.

> Some services will bundle the device and the service which is nice if you're not tech savvy.  But they usually cost more per month.

Other companies sell the VoIP/SIP service by itself, and you can buy a device that will talk to that SIP server.  Usually much cheaper but then its all on you to configure, both the VoIP service as well as the device(s).

The rules of this sub prohibit making recommendations, so you're not likely to get direct answers here.

You'll need internet service and a network cable to plug the phone into your home network.

> Either a cloud based phone system with a cloud based SIP phone service provider or a cloud based answering service or call center type solution would remove a lot of the limitations you currently have. It seems the rules of this sub say that I can’t recommend products or services so I guess that’s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There’s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!

> Really appreciate the honesty and detail in your post - this is something I see a lot with agencies working across different ICPs. I’ve helped agencies and other service businesses tackle this exact split, so I’ll share what’s worked (and what hasn’t) from real projects.

You’re spot on that C-level marketing execs aren’t hanging out on YouTube for tactical “how to” content. They’re more likely to search on Google, skim LinkedIn, or get recommendations in their network. For lead gen in that space, I’ve found YouTube is usually a slow burn unless you’re producing high-level thought leadership or case study content that gets embedded, shared, or referenced elsewhere.

A few practical things to consider:

- YouTube can absolutely build authority and help with SEO, but for C-level direct clients it’s unlikely to be a primary lead source unless you’re investing heavily in strategic, high-quality content (think: roundtables with other execs, sharing original research, or deep dives into industry trends). These videos are more likely to get shared internally or referenced in decision-making, rather than discovered organically.
- For white-label/agency owner leads, if cold email is working and you’ve got the system down, I’d double down there and use YouTube as a content asset to reinforce credibility rather than as a core channel. You could create specific videos that answer common objections, showcase client wins, or explain your process - these can be linked in outbound, on your site, or in proposals.
- If you do go the YouTube route, focus on content you can repurpose. A well-produced client case study, panel discussion, or explainer video can be sliced up for LinkedIn, your website, or email nurture sequences. This approach maximizes ROI and visibility across channels.
- Don’t underestimate the SEO value of video if optimized properly. Even if your C-level prospects aren’t searching YouTube directly, your videos can rank in Google search, especially for branded or high-intent queries.

Personally, as the founder of AI Automation Agent, I’ve seen the best results when video is positioned as a trust-builder and authority play, not as the top-of-funnel channel for executive leads. For agency owners or more “hands-on” ICPs, it can work as a lead driver, but expect a longer ramp-up and more indirect impact for C-level targets.

Happy to dig deeper or share specific examples if helpful - what’s your current split of revenue between white-label and direct clients? That might help decide where to focus your time and content investment.

> I couldn't possible answer all those questions in a single reddit comment, lol, but I'll try.

I personally work with small local service businesses. 90% of my clients have been on Wordpress, but I'll work with any builder - it just limits how much I can do.

I have processes for building backlinks organically and I have a partner that builds high-quality paid backlinks. We only recommend paid backlinks if we're targeting competitive terms and the competitors have an impressive backlink portfolio.

Mostly, it's content and website optimization.

It changes every quarter, based on what's working and what the client's biggest opportunities are. Here's my entire workflow:

ONBOARDING:

\- Kickoff Call

\- Google Drive Folder Creation

\- Create Client Dashboard

\- Determine primary marketing channel



MONTH ONE

\- Finalize common business name

\- Setup Google Search Console

\- Finalize Website (access + basic checks)

\- Discovery Call

\- Identify keywords

\- Setup Google Business Profile

\- Setup Google analytics

\- Fix or schedule fixes for any technical issues on website

\- Finalize Operational Logistics (CRM, contact forms, autoresponders)

\- Submit business to directories

\- Set up social media accounts (Will typically have the client do this)

\- Basic website optimization (meta tags, headings, internal links)

\- Determine review/testimonial acquisition plan

\- Determine photo acquisition plans



RECURRING 90-DAY CYCLE:

\- Perform regular maintenance tasks

\- Perform data analysis

\- Identify best projects for next quarter (using a credit-based system based on the client's budget)

\- Send in-depth report and proposed projects for next quarter

\- Schedule all projects for the quarter

> Great question!

It depends on the maturity of the companies that you want as clients. Do you want to work with "immature" cash-strapped but plentiful startups or "mature" cash-rich but fewer established companies? That's your call. 

Early-stage companies tend to buy based on relationships because they don't know what they don't know. They prefer someone local, someone they know, or someone who comes recommended. That gives them a warm and fuzzy feeling. That’s where local niching works. You’re the “go-to” agency in your area.

As companies grow, they start to value industry expertise. They want an agency that already understands their space. They shouldn't ask you what a conversion is, and you shouldn't have to help them find product/market fit — they already get it. That’s when industry niching makes sense.

Even more mature companies, even those with in-house teams, look for discipline experts. They don’t want a full-service agency. They want someone who does one thing really well—PPC, SEO, email, etc. That’s specialization niching.

The top of the value chain is hyper-niching, when you combine both industry and discipline niching, like PPC for SaaS or email marketing for e-commerce tech. That positioning says, “We do one thing for one type of client, and we’re the best at it.”

Here’s the value chain in order, from lowest to highest, in how much you can charge:

Local niche → Industry niche → Discipline niche → Hyper-niche

You're already heading toward hyper-niching since you’re thinking about digital marketing for e-commerce tech or PPC for SaaS. That’s where the real money is!

I hope that helps answer your question.

Best of luck!

> We package our services as products, and those products are recommended and combined to satisfy the client's needs and goals. Each service has a set scope, and it's well-defined. We track everything in Asana and can find out when our folks are going out of scope. I think it's mostly a matter of setting expectations with clients and with staff about how much work you expect them to do and when too much is too much.

> I'm going to file this advice under "tough love".

It sounds like you're starting an agency for all the wrong reasons. It sounds like you're starting on because some guy on YouTube told you it's a good way to make extra money.

If that's not the case -- sorry for making the assumption.

I came to this conclusion because it seems like you only know what the videos told you rather than actually diving in and getting a real understanding of what it is you're doing because you actually like the service you're delivering rather than the idea of the outcome.

&#x200B;

But I will answer all of your questions anyways:

1. What Niche should I be targeting?
   1. Whatever niche you want. The niche should be specific to you and something you enjoy. You need to become an expert in your niche if you actually want to grow and retain clients long term and build authority. Don't be in a niche you hate.
2. What should be my offer?
   1. Whatever it is you're selling. I hate this idea that gurus preach that everyone has to have an "offer" that's enticing. Does what you sell offer value on its own? Then that's the offer. If it doesn't, then maybe what you sell isn't something people want.
   2. Also, you addressed this later on when you said you'd be willing to work for free to gain experience. That's an offer...
3. You need the following things in my opinion (Episode 1 of our podcast also covers all of this):
   1. Website (or landing page). You can build a simple one on Wix. My vote is always WordPress but it has a pretty hefty learning curve if you're new.
      1. This includes a domain, CMS, and hosting provider. You can technically get all three from Wix. I don't recommend it later on down the road, but that's the easiest and most affordable solution right now for you.
   2. A way to collect payments. I vote Stripe.
   3. A separate bank account from your person bank account. Keep the money separate.
   4. If you're in the US, that's all you need. You can operate as a sole prop without registering an LLC. However, I still recommend resisting as an LLC to protect your personal assets in case someone decides to come after you for whatever reason. You can use a service like Legal Zoom to do that.
4. How can I convince someone to use me?
   1. Just be honest. Don't lie about your experience. Tell them you're starting an agency around a specific service you offer and you'd like to work for them for free, a discounted rate, or a pay per performance model. Everyone starts somewhere and when you're working with actual business owners, they know that. When you offer this, you'll attract smaller business owners who can't afford actual lead gen agencies. As you start charging for your services, your types of clients will change. So just be aware of that.

&#x200B;

Addressing your other questions:

1. How should I structure my day right now?
   1. By building your brand. Build your website. Find forums, publications, podcasts, Youtube channels, etc that your niche foll

### r/agency — 2024-01-02 | 24pts

> What’s wrong with your current pricing, package and offer? You should be adjusting based on market feedback. 

If you lose a client for example, or a client doesn’t get results, figure out why. What could you have added to the service? What could you have taken away? What was missing that could have delivered the results? 

Even if they get good results, ask yourself what you could add to make the results even better.

Also get very clear on the result you’re trying to deliver, and assess how each component of your package contributes to it or doesn’t. Maybe you notice that 90% of your clients get 80%+ of leads from ads and landing pages, not SEO. It may be time to drop SEO, and get rid of all those writers draining your margin.

So there’s nothing in particular I recommend you read — my recommendation is that you spend time thinking about it with your own mind, rather than looking for a ready-made answer. You’ll make progress much faster.

In terms of marketing books everyone should read; Gary Halbert’s Boron Letters, Jack Trout & Al Ries’s Positioning and Donald Miller’s Building a Story Brand are imo must-reads. There are other ones, but not as game-changing as these 3.

> Hey! Just wanted to say that the agency model is very hard. Don't get discouraged and keep trying new things. Here are some ideas that can potentially help you out:

1. I would like to begin this list by mentioning an important point. When you start a service-based business, it typically means that you have mastered a craft and have reached a stage where you can provide real value to other people who are looking for that skill. In the beginning, I recommend solely focusing on the abilities that make YOU unique. For example, in my own case, I started helping people with designing their websites even though my main true skill was software engineering. This was really because I was prioritizing immediate cash flow rather than a long-term vision. 
2. Once you have niched down your services, it's now time to figure out who your ideal customers are. I will be writing a detailed post on how I did this for my consulting business but here's a quick summary:
   1. Reverse engineer your customer.
   2. Assume that you are someone who has recently purchased your services and answer the following questions: who am I? when did I buy? why did I buy? what exactly did I buy?
   3. Go into as much detail when answering these questions. You will thank me later.
   4. After doing so, you will be able to see a few potential avatars for your business. Pick the one that feels the best to you and whom you're confident servicing. 
3. Once you have determined your ICP, it's time to implement your marketing channels. This will be highly custom for your business so I won't go into exact details but there are typically 4 main avenues of customer acquisition:
   1. Warm outreach: message people that you know. start an actual conversation. ask them if they know anyone who is interested in your services. DO NOT ask them if they want to buy.
   2. Cold outreach: message people that you don't know. I recommend looking into [instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai). Their free training program is amazing for this.
   3. Content: This is what I'm personally spending a lot of time on these days. creating an online brand is definitely worth the effort. Give without asking and you will reap the rewards.
   4. Paid ads: Google Ads. Meta Ads, etc. I also recommend going with more niche avenues. For example, if you are building a product and have the budget, pay IndieHackers to feature them in their weekly newsletter!
4. Some bonus channels:
   1. Referrals: message your previous customers and ask who in their contacts is a great potential customer (like them) for your services. You can further increase the chance of closing this lead by providing a personalized coupon with an expiration.
   2. Partner with other agencies and affiliates. For example, if you offer web design services, team up with marketing agencies!

Hope this helps!

> I'm not saying it's your main issue, but: in many of these cases, resonance is low because relevance is low.

Your entire positioning - the folks you target, the pitch you send them, the service you offer, and so on - must be issue-centric, outcome led, and highly specific in both 1) who you serve and 2) how you serve.

Relevance is a function of specificity - and, sorry, but: neither "analytics" nor "startups" are specific categories.

If you're keeping things generic (not saying you are, I'm merely presuming), all you're doing is selling your capability ("hey, do you like analytics? I do analytics! Hey!") to people who, in 95 percent of the cases, won't even know why they might need analytics right now, and spend 0.2 percent of their week thinking about data and stuff, if that. A generic, non-specific solicitation means you put the onus of figuring out what you could do for them ON THEM - and now more than ever, the result of this is almost always... crickets.

Hence, my recommendation: really focus in on a specific segment (e.g., "SaaS Start-ups seeking their C-round in these very difficult times," "HR leaders tasked with reducing churn," etc.), and the research and identify the business's pain (!) you can solve for them.

Then, speak directly to their issue, pitching a solution (different from a capability!).

This is particularly important in your case, because not many orgs have functions which have 'analytics' in their  job description; it's something a lot of the people might need at very few times (and those who do have 'analytics' teams aren't necessarily your ideal clients, because all they'll do is hire you as staff aug, at shitty rates, IF that).

So, very few people go into the office in the mornings thinking "I need some analytics." Lots of people need better forecasts though, HR insights, improved inventory management, or much more helpful answers to "WTF works in marketing and what doesn't?" (I made these up).

Which is why you'll have to identify and put forth a solution for resolving a business issue (bonus points if it's an issue that firmly "sits" in a function/is owned by somebody with targets and a budget: Finance, HR, Supply Chain, Marketing [and the groups within these... No need to market to the CFO if you can serve the junior treasurer and be profitable!]).

So, again try to specify your "who" and "what" until it's ridiculously narrow, then try again.

Oh, and: if you can, specify an outcome, too (difficult when you start out, I know) - "I increase forecast accuracy by x," "I typically find y savings opportunities in an average trucking start parts supply chain, which usually unlock mid-six figures in cost reductions"... Things of this nature). 

If you get this right, you'll be able to write super-short emails that really resonate. Think: "Hey, elrooto, need to get your forecasts in shape before your next investor pitch meeting? I increase forecast accuracy by x percent using y, and give clients their results in IB-gra

> Imagine if a client came to you and said they had "zero budget" but wanted to attract business. It's not impossible, but it makes things a little trickier. Like most things, the more you can invest the better the results you will have. So I'd set aside a little budget for this. 

I'd be mindful that if you want a book to attract more than the average number of sales (300 copies) you need to build a large following. At the beginning you're going to be scrapping your way to the first few hundred followers - but overtime people will naturally come to you. 

​ I'd suggest the following - most of which are low-cost ideas:

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. [I wrote a lot about this here](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).

Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.  

3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. [Make it a habit to set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have. Follow up on these calls too. 
4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.
5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses.

> There are plenty of things to 'stay away from'. But we can only talk about them in a general sense (e.g. clients with low budgets, online charlatans, suspect vendors etc...). I'd also advise avoiding hourly rates too. 

The service, service types, and structure templates are a great place to start. But the hardest challenge for most new consultants is attracting clients. If you don't have a large base of connections you can start with, it can be tricky.

Having social media accounts is fine, but social media doesn't give you the reach it used to. It's very easy to spend a lot of time working hard on social media accounts which don't go anywhere.

* **After hours** so they can genuinely be “open 24/7” without staff burnout
* **Overflow cover** when multiple lines are busy
* **Legal intake** so new leads are qualified and prioritized before you call back

Some want simple message taking, others have us follow detailed scripts, route urgent calls, or book new clients straight into their calendar. All our receptionists handling legal calls are trained on intake etiquette, legal terminology, and when *not* to filter out a potential client unless you’ve told us to.

From what we’ve seen, the biggest frustrations firms have with other services are:

* Agents making judgment calls about who to put through (and losing good leads)
* Long call delays or poor audio quality that frustrates callers
* Generic scripting that doesn’t reflect how your firm works
* Pricing structures that punish you for short calls

Our plans start from smaller minute bundles for firms just covering after hours up to fully tailored setups. It’s not one size fits all. If you’re weighing options, look for a provider that: 1. Lets you control call handling rules in detail, 2. Has experience with legal intake, and 3. Doesn’t make callers feel like they’ve hit a wall.

Happy to answer questions or share what’s worked for other firms, even if you go with someone else.

> You clearly haven’t shopped this type of service. Check out the largest service in the industry ruby.com they have thousands of clients and they are more than double my pricing. With Ruby you also don’t get priority service and your calls get answered by a huge call center instead the same group of agents who become familiar with your business. 
Granted there are some cheaper services out there, but you probably wouldn’t want them talking to your customers. 
You could also hire your own receptionist for 36k per year +benefits and you only get ~7.5 hours a day of coverage.

> Based on other comments in this thread that I agree with, there's another human factor I'd like to add. 

They just don't care. 

In order for a law firm to actually care about this, they need to see through the technological lenses that show value. 

I doubt many law firms even try to measure or quantify the value legal tech products even bring, maybe the innovation team does some kpi analysis but no one measures the *actual* result or value from a product. The day law firms start measuring the value return of a product or service is the day Harvey goes bankrupt. 

There's even a unofficial saying among legal tech founders that once you win a single law firm, you can almost win all others. This is because when purchasing the product, the law firm industry is far more relationship based than merit based based.

It's very much stuck in a limbo of any product being assessed as "other big law firms are using it so should I" or "my client finds this fancy so I must get this tech to show everyone we're tech forward".

One might question "why can't IT initiate this approach?" and as someone who's done a deep dive on why IT doesn't partake in this area, it's because law firm IT teams are overworked to death with their own responsibilities, they'd rather not deal with new creative ideas that can end their careers if something goes wrong and they get blamed for it.

As for your suggestion on why not get an agency for doing such work for the law firm, it's been answered before in this subreddit that it's an absolute pain and restrictive for the people who have tried setting up private cloud premise solutions collaborating with IT.

In the end, you need to ask yourself why go through this hassle for a firm that only cares about the final result, not the "process" or "cost savings" or "maintenance work". If you do miraculously find a firm who's willing to work with you, the associated cost and work you need to put up with a dinosaur firm far outweighs the return on value you get from it as well. Legal tech just isn't big enough to make that kind of money.

> The quickest way to lose a sale with me is to try to use time as a pressure point.  Rarely will a couple days be enough time for me to realistically evaluate what you're selling, so be prepared to adjust the trial period. Likewise, don't tell me that the price is only available if I commit right away -- if you're selling me something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars over a lifetime, I need to take my time, and as a solo, I don't have time to spend hours at a time making a decision right away.  A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.  Needless to say, I declined to consider them after that.

> To answer your first question, for criminal defence lawyers, in police investigations you are often given exhibit numbers and bag numbers that correspond to specific pieces of seized evidence. Having a piece of software that correctly creates a chain of custody chart - and identifies potential gaps - based on the evidence would be helpful. Creating these charts in large investigation is tedious work. I could see a low cost ai solution that does this 1 single task well being a hit among defence lawyers and maybe potentially government prosecution services.

> Saying RAG is useless in litigation is like saying keyword search is useless in disclosure. Litigation isn’t about neatly reading one document front to back, it is about dealing with bundles of pleadings, witness statements, precedents and years of correspondence. No LLM can realistically just read everything without retrieval. Even with big context windows you are not fitting an entire disclosure set or case history in one go.



"Vectors pretending to be understanding" misses the point. Embeddings are what make semantic search work. That is what lets you find termination when the document says rescission or employment agreement when it says service contract. It is not a trick, it is how you avoid brittle keyword matching. Modern stacks use hybrid approaches that combine dense and sparse retrieval with rerankers to make results far more reliable than the strawman you are criticising.



The blindfold analogy is back to front. RAG is what grounds the model in the actual record. If your system brings back different results each time and misses key passages then your pipeline is badly engineered. Fixed chunking, consistent top-k, rerankers and audit trails are all standard ways to make retrieval stable and repeatable.



The idea that an LLM can "just read the text directly" also does not hold up. Context windows have limits. Even at 1,000,000 tokens you cannot brute force a litigation dataset. Without retrieval the model has no way of knowing what matters and what does not.



On the point about waiting a few hours for an answer, that is not how litigation teams work. They need iterative passes: first a chronology, then cross-checking witness statements, then building out issue lists. Speed and cost do matter, because lawyers are not going to sit around waiting overnight for each run.



The real challenge in litigation AI is governance. Can you show what was retrieved, explain why it was retrieved, and defend it in court? Retrieval actually makes that easier because you can inspect and log the passages that shaped the answer. Pure read everything approaches turn into a black box with no audit trail.



So the issue is not that RAG is useless. It is that your badly designed RAG is useless. Throwing out the whole approach ignores the realities of both the technology and litigation practice.

The NY Times suit does not affect ZDR users. From [https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/](https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/) \-  
  
**What if I am a business customer and I have a Zero Data Retention agreement?**

* You are not impacted. If you are a business customer that uses our Zero Data Retention (ZDR) API, we never retain the prompts you send or the answers we return. Because it is not stored, this court order doesn’t affect that data.

Technically there is no reason why an LLM provider cannot maintain data security and privacy. Like any business relationship, it comes down to whether you trust the vendor. We trust OpenAI to maintain data privacy out of their own self-interest. We also utilize other LLM providers, including the some of the cloud providers you mention, to maintain vendor diversification and LLM specialization. 

We are early in this technology cycle, and people fear change. At the same point in the cloud services technology cycle, people argued that giving your data to cloud providers was crazy. But in the long term the lowest cost and highest value services will become the norm. Unless you are a very large firm with very significant risk, it's unlikely that commercializing locally hosted LLMs will be the answer.

> Sorry this happened to you.  Unfortunately this is always a risk when someone shares their ideas while selling a service or interviewing.  You have to have a line in mind that you are not willing to cross when answering questions for free.  In other words, when will you simply walk away.

While signing an agreement (about ownership, not using your ideas etc.) may help, the reality is it costs money to enforce an agreement.  Worse, a court may value your idea for an amount that is less your' attorney's fees which would easily be $25K-$100,000.

I advise vendor clients to strike an agreement for a price that (1) their customer pays a chunk upfront thereafter at regular intervals and for the vendor to agree to a contract period that is shorter than the vendor would like but can live with e.g. 6 months, 9 months whatever etc and perhaps limits the scope of work the vendor originally had in mind (so as to limit potentially costly deliverables). You get the idea. All of this is put in the contract.

 While its less than ideal, the vendor client gets some money, improves the product on a real customer,  receives IP protection in writing (enforceability could still be an issue) and simultaneously seek additional customers. 

Your story is a great reminder to ALL of us about the delicate balance between (1) demonstrating one's competence to get hired and (2) being taken for a ride.

I do not need it for anything other than this one case. I want to be able to upload all of my files and it be my legal assistant (like many programs offer). Does anyone know of a place that offers this?  If so, one that offers it at a reasonable price?  I appreciate any input.  One note, I know that google, word, excel, and others will help organize things, but that's not what I'm looking for. I would like something dedicated to helping me specifically build my case and walk me through it.  Thank you in advance.

Ultimately, I decided to return every single penny since I was the poc , which meant I bore the entire cost out of my own pocket.
Now, I’ve built a team of two. My co-founder is strong in digital marketing, and we’ve decided to focus on helping small businesses scale, with a service priced at $600.  we are confident in our product this time unlike last time.
I’d really appreciate your guidance on a few things:

1. What should I do differently to ensure I don’t fail this time?

2. I’ve read your answers and they’re genuinely excellent-  how can I build and maintain a strong pipeline?

> facebook can work for agency client-gen, but only if you add friction and treat it like outbound at scale.

benchmarks i’ve seen (US, broad B2B services):

\-   CPL: $25–$100+ (trade/local niches often at the low end, "sell to marketers" at the high end)

\-   form -> booked call: 10–25% if you qualify; <10% if you don’t

\-   show rate: 50–70% with SMS reminders + calendar holds

what helps quality:

\-  ditch simple lead forms. send to a landing page with a 6–8 question filter (budget, role, timeline). require calendar booking on submit.

\-   auto-qualify: disqualify gmail domains, tiny headcount, or "just exploring" answers.

\-   optimize for Completed Registration or Schedule with CAPI + offline conversions, not cheap Lead form fills.

\-   retarget anyone who watched 50%+ of your hook video, site visitors, and engagers. that’s where booked-call CPA gets sane.

\-   creative: 30–45s UGC-style ad that states niche + painful before/after + 1 quick proof. rotate weekly.

if you’re selling to DTC brands, keeping creative fresh is the unlock. i’ve had good results leaning on [Needle](https://www.askneedle.com/) for rapid ad and email variants (48-hour turnarounds, you still approve everything, and it’s \~a third of typical agency cost). basically an AI-powered creative engine that learns from performance and ships weekly.

Here's how it works:

1. I send them a DM or an email with something like this: 

*Hey \[First Name\],*

*Most business owners don’t know this, but chatbots are saving companies $300K+/year in support and sales costs.*

*I went ahead and built a starter chatbot for \[Business Name\], just using public info from your site - it’s already answering FAQs and capturing leads.*

*Want me to show you how it works (and what it could be saving you)?*

*Quick 10-min call - promise it’ll be worth your time.*

  
2. When they actually book a call, I enter their website URL into [noem.ai](http://noem.ai) and customize a very basic support Ai agent for them

3. on the call, I use Noem's chrome extension to show them what it'll look like on their own website, how it solves their customer's problems, how it upsells their Shopify products... and answer any questions they have

4. it usually ends with - can you finish building this for me?

5. Based on what they want I decide whether to do it myself and keep 100% profit (usually around $3000+hosting fees) or pay noem $250, have them build it and keep the difference. 

  
Your old clients probably don't need more of your services, but everyone is now transitioning to Ai and are too busy or overwhelmed. You can be the solution.

> Hi everyone, I’m 18 and currently in 12th grade, but I’ve been building an agency idea around AI voice agents and chatbots for service businesses. I need some blunt, real-world feedback from people who have actually run Global agencies from India and understand client acquisition, retention, and taxes. The service part of my business is mainly automated because once the agent is set up, it doesn't need to give constant efforts, so the business model is more focused on sales only.

Here’s my current model:

We provide AI voice agents and chatbots that handle incoming calls, answer queries, schedule appointments, and capture leads.

Pricing: ₹12,900/month (~$149)+(Additional Credits)for voice agents and ₹8,600/month (~$99)+(Additional Credits) for chatbots.

Client distribution: about 60% choose voice agents, 37% chatbots.

Client churn: expecting ~2 clients lost per month.

I have 6 employees, each paid ₹40,000($458)/month, and each brings in ~4–5 clients monthly.

I’m planning to bring in two Professional sales co-founders, both fully focused on sales + outreach (not technical). I’d keep 50% profits while they take 25% each.

I want to run this while balancing studies, so the co-founders would handle most day-to-day operations.
(And the thing is I'm hiring Professionals, Who have skills in the sales and outreach area)


My questions:

1. Does this business model look sustainable/scalable in the USA/UK market?


2. Are my prices too low or reasonable or high?


3. What should I improve before scaling (processes, pricing, client retention, tax planning, etc.)?


4. With high fixed salaries (₹2.4L/month employees + CA costs), am I taking on too much risk too early?


5. For anyone who has run an agency in India, what are the hidden challenges (clients, taxation, compliance) I should know before going all in?



I’m not looking for sugarcoated replies — I want genuine, practical advice from someone who has actually run an agency in India.

> I think the short answer is just to speak their language.

If you're talking to the business owner then that means communicating your value in dollars or bottom line for them.

For our agency, we don't focus on the fact we sell SEO and PPC services. We say, "We get you leads." We just happen to use SEO and PPC as the mechanism to do so.

The challenge we've run into with our pricing and value is that website hosting and maintenance is included in the monthly marketing component along with DNS management assistance (updating records like SPF, DKIM, or whatever else needs added).

It's a challenge for us to communicate that value sometimes because the primary service offering is marketing and if the marketing efforts aren't performing as well as the client would like in a given period, the administrative component is completely lost on them -- a component that would cost them to have someone manage for them with no actual ROI to speak of.

We're pretty transparent on our value statements on our website:

[https://evergrowmarketing.com/about/](https://evergrowmarketing.com/about/)

We have our 3-core values which is all we need based on how we structure our services and we have reasons why you should and should NOT work with us.

Our services are also way more affordable then,you'll find almost anywhere else (unless you go overseas).

Having said that, we did do a few episodes on communicating client value on The Agency Growth Podcast. I'd check out episodes:

* \#005 (Adding Value to Your Services to Increase Client Retention)
* \#008 (Keep Clients from Leaving You by Helping Them Understand Your Value)
* \#159 (Poor Client Communication Kills Agencies)

We offer white labelling services for a design agency who don’t have the skill set in house anymore to actually develop the websites they design, they’re great to work with and I know the feeling is reciprocated. 

I’d love to work with more agencies and offer our development services out though. I feel it benefits both sides as it saves me the stress of finding new clients, and we’re an expert team with over 12yrs working together so we perform really well and know our stuff.

> What is it that makes you feel you need to narrow your focus?

Are you missing deadlines? Product quality diminishing? Leaving money on the table elsewhere?  Or no longer want to do xyz..

Sure, being more focused will probably accelerate some things, but acceleration isn’t always good if it sends you in the wrong direction. 

My experience: We acquired another agency just because one of the sr. partners had a quarterly goal to grow our firm through acquisitions. On paper, made perfect sense. 

He was so strict on hitting his goal, he would not push back his objective date. And fast-tracked our first acquisition. 

So, we bought an agency that wasn’t a great fit. Their client base was used to paying $500 per month and basically getting unlimited web support. 

No one tracked time, no one was really accountable. 

We were very different. 

We bought the company, and immediately started charging those clients our rates. And kept track of which clients cost more. And charged them accordingly. 

Within a year I think we went from acquiring 50 new clients.. to having maybe 10 left. Maybe less. 

The amount of time and energy my team put into learning all these new clients, their campaigns, etc etc.. all in vain really because the clients were never really a good fit. 

I guess my main point here is.. don’t sacrifice your logo term goals for short term gains. 

Is your goal to leave your 9-5?

If so, what revenue  goals do you have to make that leap?

Which product path is more likely to help you reach that mrr goal? Or, pick the product/ service you are most passionate about… and learn how to build the recurring payment model you need

Your 9-5 affords you a lot of freedom to take risks and be creative. I would leverage that to find your answer.

You are trying talk the talk and walk the walk. If you had a team full of team members just like you (the assumed great designer/developer that didn’t mention sales and marketing) you might could do this. How much does someone want to make with your experience and talent level? How are you going to keep people happy while you bring in large saas companies as your clients while your team gets paid nothing? 

I’d love to see what you Bruno your organizational structure looks like doing this 100k per month. What is the breakup of retainers vs project work. What is your value prop? What makes someone want to hire you? Because you say you are good? 

Do you currently work at an agency? What is your experience ?

I’ve been doing what you are trying to do. I’ve been in the industry for over 20 years.   If you want to maximize revenue and reach your goals you will need to hire low cost talent and charge high prices. That means you have a very large hill to get over to be able to charge $150+ per hour.   You can’t sell services for that cost and have language barrier issues. There are massive cultural differences. People in India selling services for that much are hiring native English speaking people to handle accounts.  The market you want to be in isn’t something l, realistically, that someone from India is going total into and run away with your goals in 18 months.   If a company is looking specifically for Indian talent in America they are trying to pay 15-30 per hour.   If you are white labeling and working for other agencies, this might get to 45 per hour — once you start charging above that the amount of competition that have American tech company resumes your value per dollar starts to get priced out unless you are able to be super niche or have an out of this world value prop.      

You’d have to get really lucky and land that one client that opens all these doors for you to hit this dude. I wish you luck but I think you have lessons coming. Answer those questions I asked above. I’ll be happy to give you a reality check. 

How much business (in revenue per month) do you think one person can manage architect, project manage and make sure is the quality of work you say you can produce to justify the prices you will need to be at to meet your goals. 

If you didn’t say 100k (lol you can’t) then you need to have someone as good as you to do the rest. Was it lower than 50k? Then you need three. How much does that cut into profit? What about the people doing the work?

I feel like you put a bunch of numbers in a dart board, threw a dart and said this is my goal and you haven’t given this any thought. Please explain to me how I’m wrong!

> It's going to be a tough sell. My biggest question (and one that the copy should answer): why should business owners use your subscription services instead of other similar ones or even low-cost no-code builders like Wix, Shopify, etc?

I think there needs to be more clarity about what exactly a subscription consists of:

-What are considered "Essential Pages"? How many pages is that?
-It says that everything is included but then asks for $100 for each additional page and other costs for more services.
-Mentions Content being included but doesn't give specifics. Does that mean your company will write unlimited copy per month?
-Table needs to be updated for mobile so it's fully viewable as someone else said

> Seems like we’re in similar positions. I only get referrals & they close pretty quickly. But cold selling is tough.

I was going to say they have the brand name, but then you said they were startups.

Did you go to 4 demos of startups? Kind of lost me there.

Anyways, there are a couple ways i’ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.

1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day—absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.

2. GHL dudes cold-calling—These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They’re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. 

3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. 

Lastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. 

Also, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.

> Not exactly an agency, but a marketing consultancy; "whale hunting" is our deliberate strategy.

We primarily target P&L owners (like business unit leads) since the marketing functions serving their BUs typically don't have a budget for a service like ours, but we do get the odd marketing director or CMO keen to improve their function with us, too.

Our primary strategy is inbound with a mix of content and events, plus we're big on expansion (65+ percent of revenue comes from existing clients and buyers), meaning we don't have too much pressure to go out and hunt.

(Book tip btw.: grab a copy of "Never say sell" by McMakin and Parks if you haven't read it yet!)

Sales cycles and conversion plays can be very long (six months plus is the minimum for us; 24 is not unheard of), negotiations are sometimes complicated (think IP rights negotiations, liability insurance discussions, IT compliance audits, payment and exchange rate nonsense - most large enterprises will make their suppliers 'eat' both, which can be substantial - and other silliness [like your buyers not being aware of their corporate's procurement policies...]). And onboarding can be tricky, like others here have already said.

Add to that that a win is not always the same as work and revenue right away, and you see why this isn't for everyone: The first step for us is often the signing of a "master services agreement," which comes with a hypothetical budget; said budget is then only released when the client accepts a specific project within said MSA (which usually happens, but is not always guaranteed; again: we're not exactly an agency, so your experience might differ). 

But then: these projects tend to be "big ticket,", and the long sales cycle and ramp-up are compensated by very streamlined "downstream" processes. Plus, these guys always pay on time and in full. Oh, and we find client retention and development much easier with the "bigger fish..." 

But this last bit might be subjective.

Overall, I think there's no wrong or right answer when it comes to the "enterprise yes or no" question, but in my experience it's easiest to focus on one segment explicitly (so: enterprise OR SMB), since bizdev is so different between the two... I guess there are folks who can run two very different sales processes and cycles simultaneously - I certainly cannot.

Final thought:

Winning enterprise clients can be significantly more complex and costly than winning SMBs, and often there's more risk (we took a big cash flow hit when lining up a big contract with a Fortune "200" 2 years ago, with significant biz dev cost and prolonged negotiations resulting in a situation where the account ran "in the red" for nine month)... But I do find they're easier to service. 

Oh, and: the fact that they're a bit more difficult to bring in seems to make it so there's less competition for their business? ('s how it feels to me, at least... We rarely pitch, and if we do, we rarely see firms of our size [3.5 FTE] in t

> I'm going to echo some of the other sentiment here. I get 5-10 of these a day, this looks identical to the other ones I get, except about podcasts vs marketing or leads, or SEO, or *insert random market agency service flavor of the month here".

I would adjust the first paragraph, and tone. Personally it reads like you insinuate they don't know or aren't good at what they're doing and you can help them. Instead of a framing like that maybe go with a value proposition like "I love your podcast and want to help you grow it and find more of your people" your proposition is basically the same, get more "customers/listeners" but fring it in an enthusiastic way to frame it as you will be working together on a team towards this common goal you both want vs starting from a negative framing of "you're not doing these things right, do better." I'm being a little hyperbolic on the framing but you need to be, people are going to spend 5-10 seconds deciding whether to read or delete your email so assume your tone is dialed to 11 for the decision maker as a framing exercise.

Also, and this is for anyone here, do not send these emails out from any free email account. Get yourself a domain and a real email address or no business of substance will take you seriously or respond back and the ones that do are likely to be desperate or discount/value shoppers. Domains are cheap and you can use free zoho email if you can't pay for Microsoft 364 or GSuite Email license.

Agency business, like most B2B (Business to Business) services and products lives on repeat business. New client acquisition in the business space is the hardest and most costly part of the business so spend more time and effort at the start and also realize that most prospects need to be touched 6-8 times to move the the next level in a funnel. 

In summary: 
Cultivate a good list
Provide value from the start
Be persistent and consistent
Realize timing is one of the biggest deciding factors and you can't control it. You want to make sure when they are finally in pain, need, or fed up with current provider you're in their inbox or memory.
Answer you phone or emails quickly
Do what you say, How you say, For the time and price you say.

> That's a good perspective and to answer your question, it's true that I'm going to bear some extra work just to build relationship.

You know, most of the small business owners have websites which contains 5-12 unique pages or less. If I develop their website and utilize micro-services out there, I will have their website up and running with unlimited bandwidth, CDN powered and SSL included with $0 cost at all, literally forever.

If they want to have CMS, that can also be included and it will still not cost them anything but when they want to add features like e-commerce, taking payments online, or any management kind of system which is not static, that won't be free, and they will know that beforehand.

> I mean, you literally are advertising for air or your service that includes air. Not sure which. 

Air honestly looked like a viable option for a business we own (not the agency, but another business). 

But when we got on a sales call the salesperson could answer zero tough questions. It came off as scammy AF. 

If you’re gonna pitch your product for $100k, be able to answer basic questions like, “can I speak with a reseller” or “what about server costs and usage fees over time?”

$100k is a good chunk of money and wouldn’t consider investing in a license of software without due diligence. But thankfully by the end of the call the sales rep was down to $25k, so super desperate sounds. No legitimate business discounts by 75% in the course of 1 call. 

I talked to a dude who bought the reseller license and he said it wasn’t what they claim and he’s having all sorts of issue with the tech. Take that with a grain of salt tho. 

But good luck anyway. If you somehow make it work for your clients that’s a good thing. I just think it’s a shiny object with mlm and guru vibes. But do you boo.

Our client does landscaping. Leads are our objective, but our current strategy has been leads that go to our website and book a call with the client directly through a calendly embed.

We've been running the ads ourselves for about a month, having used an upwork contractor for the month prior. The contractor got us shit leads but a lot of them. We have gotten good quality leads but not that many of them and our cost per booking is pretty bad.

It is a local business, facebook estimates an audience of around 2.4mil restricting it to our client's service area in San Francisco. As for broadening it even more and letting Facebook algo optimize. I haven't really considered that before, would that really work with a local business? Wouldn't we end up with leads from outside the client's service area?

Appreciate the help!

> This is the most streamlined and quickest roadmap to your first client (I’ll include some walls that early consultancies hit so you can watch out for). 

**Step 1 - Refine your offer, be a specialist for a specific problem.** 

Everyone selling “dashboards,” “analytics,” or “data strategy” blends into the same grey soup.

As a small firm starting out, you need to pick a niche + a pain point that already costs them money.

For example, E-commerce has inventory blind spots, Healthcare has reporting delays to execs, Construction has job-cost overruns from bad data flows.

You don’t need anything fancy, just pick a high-value problem, an underserved niche and you will likely find proof of concept there (the feasible service + niche you can generate results consistently). 

*Also: These small niches are worth tens of millions of dollars, it’s not like you're gonna run out of demand on day 2.* 

**Step 2 — Build a simple credibility loop (not a fancy website).**

You absolutely do NOT need a full-out website, there are teams out there working with zero website. 

What you need: 

First, just make a landing page that has: 

\- Services: Detail your range of services.

\- About Us: Share your story, mission, values, and team.

\- Case Studies: Demonstrating your success (or research if you don't have clients).

\- Booking Links: Make it easy to get in touch with you.

Second, you want to have a credible LinkedIn profile where you share small, practical insights from your industry. 

Remember, concentrate on being useful + credible, not being big. 

**Step 3 — Talk to real people before pitching.**

Forget big platforms, events, or “building an audience.” When you’re small, almost none of that converts. The highest-yield move? Targeted, relevance-based conversations.

* Find 10–30 people already dealing with the exact pain you solve. Think: ops managers drowning in reporting, PMs stuck in spreadsheet hell, founders complaining about data chaos.
* Message them with a low-pressure task. Not pitching — just: *“Hey, I’m trying to learn more about {{your Topic}}. Mind if I ask you 2–3 quick questions?”* People answer because you’re not selling.
* Turn insights into offers. Once you hear the same pain 5–10 times, shape your offer around *that* specific friction point.

**Step 4 — Outreach is the name of the game.**

Once you’ve got your first client down, build a solid case study. Then outreach and networking all the way. 

**Bonus: What you should NOT do:** 

Don’t lead with tools like Power BI, Snowflake, Azure, Tableau — Clients don’t care what you use.

Don’t build a product yet — Every first-time founder wastes months here. Talk to people first.

Don’t try to appeal to everyone — Capture your unique market then expand later.

> Remind yourself:
1) You are in the room because you have already proven you have something of value to offer everyone else in that room. You don’t have to act differently - act you you acted to have been invited into that room in the first place.
2) Great questions lead to great answers. Ask great questions so others can okay their part. Some value I would expect from you if I were a partner: keeping everyone focused on the core commitments and reminding them of the details. They likely don’t know them as well and leaders tend to think too much in the abstract. Help them understand and think through the connective tissue. What haven’t they considered- risks, challenges, ancillary services? What are competitors likely to offer - what is our clear differentiator? Talent, cost, track record? What haven’t we considered about abc? What if…? All questions/value adds that sound good or lead to good insights. Requires little knowledge.

> Aa a consultant, I can say that your research sounds about right. Depending on the complexity of the project and expertise required, it wouldn't be surprising if an experienced consultant quoted them $500/hr.

Given the company's financial situation though, you might only be able to get $150-$200. From what you described, it sounds like that would be a fair rate assuming that it could cover whatever costs you would incur providing your services to them. 

The one big thing that I would want to know before I start a project like this would be what do they know about their customers and are they willing to spend money to solve the problem you are about to build a solution for?  If they can't answer that question, then you could end up building a product for them that nobody wants to buy. Which in your case, might be fine because you're still getting paid, but that does nothing to help the startup that you are working with.

I have struggled in the early stages with a few questions:

1. How do you gain and retain customers? Building a customer pipeline is decently tough, I feel like gaining repeat customers that don’t just have one off projects has been pretty difficult..

2. How much do you charge your client? I imagine this is project specific, especially if you are working a longer term contract as opposed to a small one off project? How do you gauge a fair market value for your services?

3. When you build a “cash cushion” and think about scaling, what amount or percent of your operating income are you divesting into talent development and what percent return are you expecting to achieve after the 6 month mark? 

4. You mentioned you take one two contracts a year (I imagine taxes and cost of living will be different where you are), what are you typically getting paid? Also is it hourly, or a percentage of the implementation revenue, or a one lump sum at the end present of your deliverable?

> Hey, I answered a similar question in another post about how I got my consulting business started. I'll copy/paste it here, but feel free to ask questions:

"When I ventured out on my own as an independent, I found that a website brought very little value and only added unnecessary runway time and cost. A well thought out LinkedIn profile actually went much further for me.

I also got my own domain, but again I don't think it brought much value.

I spent way too much time trying to showcase a portfolio of services that I wanted to provide, but it was very difficult to sell (I suck as a salesperson). I had to decide whether I wanted to stick to my guns and continue to only sell the services that I wanted to do or to suck it up and do what I did as an employee (what clients were demanding and were willing to pay for): solving complex post M&A and other critical business issues.

I decided then that the most important thing was to land that first client to get the cash flow going, this took about 2-3 months. After that, I was so busy doing work for the client that I didn't have time to scout for more clients, so I focused on building up a network of recruiters, interim placement firms, consulting brokerages/middlemen and larger consulting firms looking for specialist competence that they didn't have inhouse (but I did).

The first client was the toughest to land but then it got easier and easier as more and more opportunities came from my network, making it easier to jack up the hourly/daily rate.

So for me, I couldn't really change the market demand to hire me for what I wanted to do. Instead the market was willing to financially compensate me very well for something I was already good at (but didn't really enjoy or find challenging).

So I decided the better choice for me was to accept financial compensation sacrificing job satisfaction for 10 years and then retire early from "corporate life". "

> This is where the reality dysfunction goes into overdrive.   

Short answer: once you get past the basics (competence, resilience, strategic agility), there are ZERO universal & stationary predictors of individual survival in this space. Your continued employment with the organization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as the result of a multi-constraint zero-input analytical process where the only guiding principle is: "What does this salary contribute toward **future** exit valuation".

This is where you start to see the dizzying complexity of this space. For example, as the SVP of Transformation your value is "person who makes getting value creation programs implemented more likely, because they have the trust of the CEO, board, and relevant stakeholders." Selection process is: "best person that we can find who meets those criteria right now at an affordable price..." You and your team will cost around $15 MM in exit valuation ($1 MM budget, 12 multiple, $3 MM equity award) which they are going to want to see 10 X return on ($150 MM increase in valuation).

That's the math when they make their offer, at least....

The following day....

* Due to our factory burning down on national news, the board has decided to make a strategic pivot away from being a CPG company to a strict B2B focus. Given the depth of these changes, you will appreciate that our transformation leader should come from a B2B background. These HR people are here to help.
* The CEO is a raving asshole, we're replacing him. Roll D6 to determine your fit with the new executive, who is likely heralding a broader change in culture...
* We just paid too much for a company owned by a buddy of the Chairman and installed that douche on the board since they're now a minority shareholder... He's old school - he has his inner circle, who have been with him for 20 years. Everyone else is his personal bitch (especially if they don't have $50MM in the bank). He pulls the strings and you dance, like the Puppet that you are.... Speak up, Bitch! ([https://youtu.be/a\_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm](https://youtu.be/a_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm)).  (oh dear god, this one was fucking painful while it lasted)
* We have the opportunity to acquire Company X; as a condition of doing a deal, which will double our sales and quadruple our valuation, we need to find their Chief Strategy Officer a job. Fortunately we have a solution to this challenge...
* The Manager Partner has decided to install one of their former proteges, who has a MASSIVE cocaine habit, as your new "Strategic Advisor". Roll 2D10 to determine what is going to come out of his mouth into the Managing Partner's ear.  You can attempt a saving throw against penalties based on your personal prestige score.
* Our Chief Strategy Officer screwed up and offered someone a job at the wrong career band, resulting in them qualifying for equity. To avoid the embarrassment of admitting this mistake to their CEO & board (and likely being fired),

> That's an answer everyone must determine for themselves. I'm an evangelist for financial planning and personal finance knowledge. Everyone, no matter their wealth, can benefit from understand basic budgeting concepts and fundamental topics like insurance, taxes, and indexed investing. The vast majority of Americans, even many wealthy people, don't understand these topics. I argue that everyone can find a financial planner that will provide more benefit than they cost. 

Now, there are many definitions of "wealth management." Some consider this to mean investment management. Others consider it to mean some combination of financial planning and estate planning. Some may consider this term to mean a combination of all the above. There's no one definition. I'd argue that there are levels to wealth management, too. The wealth management provided to someone with $1M will be almost unrecognizable compared to the services of someone with $100M. Each client benefits from the service, but they receive different types of service. 

Short answer: no matter your wealth, wealth management can benefit you. 

Longer answer: the type and scope of service will depend on your wealth and personal circumstances. This decision is best decided by consulting several firms and individuals in order to gather the facts, weight the options, and choose your optimal route.

> It’s probably not an outright scam in that they probably do offer you some amount of education and get you placed in some sort of training position somewhere. It’s not really a scam if they deliver the services you paid for.

The real question is whether or not what they can offer is valuable, and the answer is probably not unless you can’t get a similar experience from just getting an internship yourself, which it sounds like you already did.

They probably don’t have anything unique to teach you that you couldn’t learn somewhere else or maybe even for free just by reading what people share on this sub. And obviously a financial consulting “bootcamp” isn’t going to carry any prestige. Bootcamps are great for people with no tech experience who want to break into tech, but finance is such a different industry I can’t see anyone really respecting that or being impressed by it.

It’s probably not worth the cost. If it were really that great he probably wouldn’t be sending cold emails to fill the classes. If it was that prestigious and useful they’d probably have plenty of inbound leads coming to them and not need to do cold outreach.

How would you tip the scale towards if the other company offered 30% less cost? Also, assuming if there is scope creep or some unexpected challenge, what would be the best way to revise or suggest a revision? Is it baked into the contract itself?

> This is interesting but sensitive.  It can be uncomfortable so please see this as my interpretation of what is going on versus my own opinions of what should happen.

>The one complaint I have heard from the locals is that westerners always get paid more even if the local consultant has similar qualification. ( I.e. graduated from a western university.) is that accurate?

Yes.  We are affected by client wishes, contracts, cost benefit, and heavily by market rates.  My Lao consultants with AUS undergrad degrees and 8-10 years of experience are making about $45 - $50k a year, which is high for the local professional services market.  My Lao consultant with a US degree and ADB experience is making about $62k.  My US folks are $200k+

However, we only have ONE US long-termer who is the face of our project.  I honestly wanted to get rid of him and go all short-termers for international experts but the client refused, they want a foreign, non SE Asian face full-time, even if its not as effective.  

>In addition, could projects like these implemented by westerners perpetuate perceptions that only Europeans are competent administrators/policy makers ( rather than locals)?

This is an issue that depends on the country. In Laos, they want an expat face (Skin color doesn't matter as long as they are from a Western country and exude it) to help drive decisions and to be able to take the blame when shit goes wrong.  Its not just developing countries that had this but advanced nations like Korea that wanted a non-regional voice that could express NO and pushback but could also be the catalyst to finally make a freaking decision.  No one wants to be the nail that sticks out because no one wants to get hammered down - the expat is suppose to take this role and responsibility.  Expats can be more "expendable" - I can fire and replace them easily.  Guess who I can't replace easily- my local consultants who went to western schools.  Why?  Their father is the vice minister of X or their uncle is the Governor of Y or... basically in a small community, these people are connected.

Is it still heavily Western based?  Yes, especially if you add all ethnicities and throw in HKG, Korea, Japan, Singapore, maybe even Malaysia and middle income kingdoms into the mix.  My clients in Bangladesh love me some MENA consultants who can play consultants on TV.  I can take South Asians to TImor-LEste to help build their port.  Former Petro experts from Kazahkstan to Indonesia?  No problem.  

Basically, the best consultants I can sell are those who have designed and implemented successful solutions in many different countries and situations before and can walk everyone through lessons learned and a strategy/vision that is based on actual wins and losses.  

Does this help answer?  Of course there are issues with race sometimes but it also seems rooted in nationality.  I'd have a very difficult time fielding a qualified West AFrican consultant for some clients in Ukraine but an Afri

> This process will vary by firm. While we could suggest some generic trainings, your firm’s requirements for margin, process to estimate, how the interplay and approvals are done across service lines, etc. will vary by firm. Unfortunately. 

General process will be —

1. Prospective client issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) 

2. A sales team is put together with folks from each service line, each service line solutions and prices to meet the client’s request, with daily calls occurring across service line to share updates 

3. A solution review is done (by service line and firm leadership)

4. Proposal content is compiled, usually not drafted from scratch but leveraging similar past proposals, stitching together, and customizing, including verbiage and graphics 

5. Reviews are done on the proposal content (by service line and firm leadership)

6. Costs are estimated by service line, then looked at overall in a deal review (by service line and firm leadership) 

7. After proposal is submitted, client will down-select a few vendors to participate in orals. Each service line will provide representation. An orals deck will be compiled and dress rehearsals with all presenters 

8. If team wins, a statement of work will be drafted, with each service line drafting its portion, and going through all necessary approvals with firm leadership, finance, legal, client review, etc. and there will be next steps to contract, staff, onboard, which is where it hands off from the sales team to the delivery team 

Proposals are weird. You can do a little work on a proposal with high dollar value, win it, and your sales numbers look great. Or a lot of work on a bunch of little proposals, or non-winning proposals, that yields the same or lesser outcome. Start wherever they’ll let you to get your foot in the door and learn. Stick on the daily calls. Observe. Help where you can. I personally love it when the juniors on my team cover the daily call as representatives for our service line. Save me 30 min of my day, they learn, they bring back updates, and if they are asked something and do not know the answer, they can take it as an action to find out or ping me to join- it’s all internal so it’s ok to not have all the answers. I am professionally grateful for juniors who want to get involved like this!

### r/LawFirm — 2026-01-24 | 1pts | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> I would be very careful with this path...

My perspective is that with AI developments in the legal industry positions whether as a receptionist or paralegal are going to start to die out over the next 10 years. Short term it can be a good opportunity, but there are so many tech companies creating new software for law firms, (most driven by AI) that are outperforming basic roles at a fraction of the cost. There's [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) and [theclaireai.com](http://theclaireai.com) taking over intake. Clio making daily tasks even easier. 

This is not just in Law, in finance most entry level positions are being taken out already because of new tech developments. My point is be careful, if you are choosing to do this for the short term it can be great, but long term you may end up competing with a computer software that can do what you are planning to do faster, a fraction of the cost, and without the training ultimately saving firms so much time and money.

Take it as you will, and do your own research too!!

By the time I called them back they were gone or I couldn't get ahold of them. Another positive attribute that no one else is mentioning is the scal⁤ability.

I am unsure about how the origintlate structure would work but I dont plan on bringing much in.

He didnt say the tax classification

No benefits, he says the firm isnt big enough to offer them.

He said there was a pre lit team but said I would be doing all the work myself when it got to me, there is a couple receptionists.

Yeah I asked about training, he said I would get fully trained with the most senior partner and they would be happy to help because I would be learning by doing their work basically so that would be motivation for them.

The next step in the process would be for me to email him and ask for a second interview where I would talk to and meet the rest of the attorneys. Not sure after reading this comments if itd be worth it

> As for your questions, here's my take on some of the aspects you mentioned:  
Consider the professional image you want to portray. Outlook and Gmail are both solid options, but Outlook might give a more formal feel.  
Both are reputable choices, but it depends on your specific needs. Take advantage of free trials to see which aligns better with your workflow.  
Absolutely crucial. Shop around, get quotes, and find a provider that understands the unique needs of your practice area.  
WordPress offers more flexibility, but GoDaddy can be simpler for beginners. It boils down to how much customization you want.  
Smart moves! Consult with a lawyer to ensure you cover all legal bases and protect your interests.  
I haven't personally used one, but many firms find them incredibly helpful for handling calls professionally without the need for a full-time receptionist. Look for one with good reviews and features that suit your needs.  
Best of luck with everything – from signing the lease to the renovations and beyond! Remember, challenges will come, but the satisfaction of building something of your own is unparalleled. Wishing you and your coworker all the success in the world!

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

If you just want them to be a glorified receptionist for the summer, then your answer is "sorry, we can't afford that." If you think they have potential to be a great attorney / employee then you pay them enough to show that you value them.

I would say most features are there on all of them. It’s really the end user experience that is the killer. It can’t be complicated to navigate or use. Some user want to explore the phones to see what it can do. Others want to call…. That’s it. The challenge is how to accommodate both while not risking a complete uproar over changing phone systems. They know we are looking but I’m afraid most don’t understand what is really happening. Regardless of how many times we have stressed it. 

Also, most of these systems are “you get what you get” for example 8x8, we asked if the BLF could be red to signify the user is not available when the status is set to DND. We were basically told the system is a package deal and cannot be customized on a case by case basis. Which I get but it’s odd to turn away a customer for something I would think a lot of people would want to have. No reason to transfer a call if it’s clear that user is not available. But the light is green so the receptionist transfers anyway.

### r/VOIP — 2023-10-13 | 1pts

> Hello!

I am in the process of opening a bar, and I need a business phone. All I really need is for there to be a digital receptionist when people call: 1 for hours of operation, 2 to speak to a manager (I'd want the call forwarded to my personal cell phone from this option in case I'm not at the bar at the time of the call), or 3 to leave a voicemail. Having text messaging would be good, too. 

My original plan, before I learned about VoIP, was to just get a cheap cell phone plan through a company like US Mobile. I bought a Pixel 6a for this purpose, and I want to use it because it is not returnable. I have been looking into [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) to buy a number, and then I was thinking I could use a softphone like Groundwire, Bria, or Zoiper. Is this a good plan, or would there be a better/easier/cheaper option? I don't see the phone getting used much at our bar because we aren't doing things like to-go ordering, a waitlist, or reservations. So, I'm looking for something simple and cost effective. It may be cheapest and easiest to just go with my original plan of US Mobile, but I think I'd lose the digital receptionist feature that I want. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I am very new to this world!

> > this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?

No, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).

Phones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.

Another thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as "line 1" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.

Usually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with "unlimited" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.

It sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.

If you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.

If your users actually want fax or want "Line 1/2/3" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.

I’ve seen solos use AI Lawyer to quickly generate a clean intake script + practice-area-specific questions (family vs estate vs biz) so the receptionist can filter properly and your consults start with real info, not rambling.

> Yo, this is such a solid update — seriously appreciate you taking the time to lay it all out. Feels like one of those posts people will come back to in a year and be like “oh damn, this was the blueprint.”

Couple things jumped out:

1. $100k in under 4 months?? That’s wild, especially in family law where things can be feast-or-famine. You clearly did your homework and didn’t just hang a shingle and pray. Respect.

2. Smart use of Robert Half — expensive upfront but you’re playing it exactly right. Scale up with low commitment, test fit, then convert if it works. Way better than hiring cold and hoping they’re not weird.

3. Billing gap + admin time: Yeah that 60 hours a week with only ~25 billable is brutal, but painfully relatable. Intake and admin can eat your life. Have you looked at virtual receptionists or intake services that plug into Clio Grow? Even if it’s a few hundred bucks a month, freeing up your time might pay for itself fast.

4. Thumbtack... ehh. I’ve heard super mixed things and your numbers kinda confirm it. If it’s only bringing in $10k on $3.6k spend, and some of those leads are flaky af, might be worth redirecting that budget elsewhere unless there’s something strategic you’re testing.

5. That ad spend spike 👀 Bold move. Curious to see what it brings in. Hopefully not just more “free consult then ghost” people.

Also, kudos for being transparent about your numbers and not sugarcoating the grind. A lot of people glamorize the solo life but you’re showing the real behind-the-scenes — juggling staff, marketing, delegation, sleep deprivation, all of it. Keep these updates coming. They’re gold.

> I started my own solo practice in January. 12 year lawyer here doing PI/civil defense. Since going solo I have expanded a bit into criminal and some admin stuff that I've dabbled in before but never had the time.

1. Malpractice Insurance - get a few quotes, should be 1000-1500/year  
2. Laptop/Printer (I got a 400 dollar one with a scanner/fax that is not set up lol)  
3. Website - I built my own in SquareSpace. I signed up for Canva free trial and used that to create firm logo and "branding package" aka the colors and fonts to use for consistency.   
4. Stack. I use Office 365, Adobe, QuickBooks, Zoom phone number. The Zoom number routes to my MIL who will serve as a receptionist (calls are intermittent) I will eventually pick up a case management software but I only have a few files and have a file structure in OneDrive that mimics the file structure of the large case management system I used at my last job.  
5. A private mailbox down the street for business mail.   
6. A meager marketing budget (think business cards, joining a local marketing group, sponsoring local group sports teams/etc). I wouldn't bother with google ads or anything. I spent 1k on google ads and the calls were utter trash. Instead the organic marketing has brought me crazy referrals.

I have a virtual office so I spent a few hundred dollars revamping my home office and passed on formal office space. If a client wants to meet, many of them are not near me/where my office would be so they do not want to meet anyway. Lots of library rooms reserved, coffee shops, things like that. 

I've only been a solo for 10 weeks but in Feb I made what I made last February and in March I will have made 1.75x my previously monthly salary, and am arguably only "working" part time right now.

> Yes it’s pretty common. One big reason is to get paid for time worked. Another is to see where staff are spending their time so the firms knows how to hire next and whether folks are doing work that another employee should be doing. For example, if a paralegal bills at $100 hour, and the receptionist time is never billed to a client, then the firm needs to know if they are getting so many calls that the paralegal is spending a lot of time just answering the phone and transferring calls (which isn’t billable) versus doing billable work like drafting motions and pleadings.  A good firm won’t use it as a weapon against staff but as a tool for resources and hiring and budgeting and profit.  It also helps a firm know which practice areas are profitable.

We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!

> You're probably only going to get people who are using it for lead acquisition and "appointment booking".

If you can't figure out where an AI agent will help you in your agency, then don't worry about it.

When you find something in your agency and think to yourself, "This is really annoying and labor intensive..." Then ask yourself if somehow AI can help with that.

Don't think about the AI first and then hold it in your hand while searching for problems.

FWIW, this is what we are actively *exploring*:

 \- Automating podcast RSS feed into our CMS to create blog post/episodes based on RSS data (it's less AI actually doing the task and more the AI writing the code to parse and post the data because we're not smart enough ourselves).

  
 \- Using AI to pull a transcript from our podcast episodes, having it locate the best and most engaging segments with time stamps to create the opening teaser (a process that used to take us like 2-3 hours to create now takes about 30-45 minutes)

  
 \- Inbound VoiceAI receptions for our clients' industry that can answer *missed* calls, take information, and send it to the sales team/CRM. Furthermore, it will transcribe the call, pull out key details (that we've prompted it to), send those details to a platform (that we've built) update information and then use the information from the call to update the platform CRM the lead came from automatically.

  
That last one is kind of unique. There's are multiple platforms we use for our clients where they get leads from and actually answering all calls and updating the leads in the CRM that's provided is a quantity/cost factor in your leads. Our clients weren't doing it so we had to get creative and find a solution.

  
 \- On the 15th of every month, my PPC team goes through all accounts and lists out which ones are underspending/overspending and are above the tCPA threshold. In one Google Sheet column, they write why they think they are over/underspending and why they are over tCPA and in the next column, they write what they are going to do / plan to do. We're exploring how we can use AI to take data from those two columns and for each client, email me/the account manager an email summary intended for the client that the account manager signs off on and sends to the client.

  
Sometimes clients log into their ad account and see things aren't great but aren't aware what we're doing to change things. This helps with that communication. They don't necessarily need better results, they just want more communication. So this is to help with that.

  
 \- Finally, it's kind of a long shot, but on the 3rd of every month our clients get their automated reports from Agency Analytics. I'd like to be able to summarize the reports via AI and send them that email from me. But the problem is that reporting and marketing is so subjective. Just because numbers are down doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Being in the landscaping industry, right now a lot of things are seasonal and i

> Yeah the demand is real but most clients have zero clue how these platforms actually work. I work at an outreach company and we've had this exact conversation with probably 20 clients in the last few months.

The problem is they want guaranteed mentions and links when that's not how Reddit or Quora function. These platforms will ban accounts instantly if they detect any promotional bullshit. Our clients who've tried the Upwork route usually get their accounts nuked within weeks.

If you're gonna offer this service, structure it around building genuine authority first, not immediate brand mentions. Focus on having real experts from their company participate in discussions naturally over months, not trying to game the system for quick wins.

The AI overview angle is legit though. Reddit answers are showing up in ChatGPT and Google's AI results way more often, so there's real value if done right.

But honestly it's a pain in the ass service to deliver because success depends on so many factors you can't control. Platform algorithm changes, moderation crackdowns, competitor reporting, etc.

I'd only take it on if you can charge premium rates and set realistic expectations about timeline and results. Most agencies we know who tried this ended up dropping it because clients expected immediate ROI from what's essentially a long term brand building play.

> A few important questions, let's give you some solid advice.  There's no such thing as "saturated" at least I don't believe. Yeah, there are lots of devs already providing web development services, so what?  there's nothing to do with competition if you know what to do exactly.    


First of all, mark my word its very hard and demands a lot of works. If you have huge budgets then ok you can burn your $$$ on paid ads and get leads instantly.  For that you should hire the PPC experts (true expert).  I know you're not looking for this answer.   


You're looking for something that works well and you can get lead,clients regular basis with minimum effort and can run your business smoothly.    


There's the answer:    


1. Cold email.  Its a very time-consuming and you have to send tons of emails to get some quality response.  Its boring and Im not doing it. As Im a massive reader, so I can confirm by reading others that cold emailing still works.   

2. Networking:  This is what Im doing and getting leads and even I made over $350k and my business now making $100k+ per year.  So, this is proven and I'm telling you from my personal experience.   Its pretty straightforward.  Just pick a niche/industry (pick an industry based on how well you know and passionate about the industry), then start connecting to the business owners every single day.   Find the way to talk to them. Join related communities, ask them questions and answer their questions.  The goal is to be well-known and trusted in the community (at least in your connections).  Well,  it could be facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, Instagram or whatever. first analyze your target people, whats the best platform they're actively spending time. So,   questions, answers, posts, videos, try everything to engage with them.  Lots of content.  Oh,  don't waste time by creating garbage with one click AI-generated text wall. Instead, read a lot about the industry, read a lot about their problems, even find the problems on groups, quora, reddit, even on google suggestions.  Then craft your content with informative information and post it.   So,   post content by adding value, ask questions that trigger them to reply, create conversations.   Dont try to sell anything directly with your posts.  When you become a trusted in some of your connections, believe me they will come to you and offer you their projects.  You know all the agency/company owner has lots of projects and they really need someone reliable and confident.  If you read some sales book or at least research online you will know that its taking a lot of time to take buying decisions. Then how can you expect someone to buy service instantly when you both just started conversations?  Im practicing this and I'm getting lots of leads,clients without any problem and this is very genuine way t generate clients.     


let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks
