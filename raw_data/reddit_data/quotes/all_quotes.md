> What /u/moso7777 said - no need to send ALL your calls to an answering service. Just send missed calls first to get a sense of your volume. Lots of good answering services already mentioned in this thread. One thing no one mentioned that's worth looking at when comparing: spam calls, vendor calls, and hang ups. Different services bill these different. [Upfirst](http://upfirst.ai/) is an AI answering services, so significantly less expensive, and it doesn't charge for spam/sales calls or calls under 15 seconds. (These are labeled in the system so you know exactly what you're billed for and what you aren't billed for.) Worth mentioning that we were started by an attorney, too.

> I've hired and managed well over 100 folks out of the Philippines over the years, but mostly I.T.  I hired on JD as a contract reviewer, but I didn't directly manage them.  I know they did well, so far as I was involved in their oversight.  I have a lot of thoughts about how to make working with somebody in the Philippines work out, and a lot of stories about it.  I just can't go into them here, but I'm open to connect for a call to talk shop one day.  I'll give you notes on the holidays, 13th month pay, and employers of record, ect.

For VR and phones, I also have a lot of experience and I have a couple of tips.  Just about all of them will expect you to forward your phone to them for the first ring, but it is probably possible for you to configure your system to ring to them only if you don't answer.  I can help you if they won't and you have trouble.

I'll say this though, that does increase the chance that your callers will hang up before they answer and they probably won't hesitate to point that out.  There will be a delay as the call switches between your phone and their line, then their standard stuff between that first ring and their answer.  Personally, I think this is fine.  I suppose some practice areas it might be a big deal, but for most imho, if somebody wants to talk to an attorney, they aren't going to hang up 4 rings in.

A service is either going to bill you by the minute or by the call.  If that is important to you, then it will narrow which services you can use.  Both models have their advantage.

All of the services will ask you to pay for so much per month in advance, then bill you overages after.  If you just don't have the volume to meet their bottom teir at signup, just about every one of them are open to reducing your account to a pay as you go, but they won't sign up new accounts that way.  It is sort of a trick and no guarantees, but you can pay like as low as $10 a month for 0 calls a month, then $10 a call every call over 1, then they will deflect sales calls for free.  It is a solid deal, so long as the quality or config isn't chasing away clients.

For some folks, though, that also doesn't matter too much.  Deflecting sales and inquires outside of the practice areas is more important than catching every single qualified lead because the operation is losing too much doing that on their own.

> Here’s what I did:
1) get the business knowledge by reading these books emyth or emyth attorney, dot com secrets, and the personal mba

2) choose your top service and systematize it from phone call to termination letter. Your goal is to create a rough initial standard operating procedure. It will be improved on over time but you need to start doing this asap

3) then do the same for the next top few service offerings

4) invest in systems that make you more efficient. I use (a) back office berries to answer & calls, schedule initial phone consultations and paid consults

5) have a very selective filtering mechanism early. I only do free 15 minute phone consultations.  ANYTHING in person is mandatory paid consult. I offer a deal of $350 for up to 90 mins but you choose. ANYTHING that requires me to review documents is a paid consultation. I get about 2-5 of these a month. 

5)  in your consult determine the top questions you need to determine whether this is a potential ideal client. If not, end the consult as soon as you can (respectfully of course). If so, make your offer in that initial consult. Don’t negotiate. Don’t talk any more about it. Simply, “it be my honor to help you with this, I charge a $10k retainer and bill $450/hour. If you’d like to move forward today I can email you my service agreement, Intake form, and invoice”

6) you need to have the minimum tech to make this as painless as possible for clients and you. I use Clio grow and Clio manage to schedule appointments, email retainer, email intake form, take payments, etc. you can use whatever you want but I guarantee you adding just these lead intake/sales SOPs and tech will make you like 20% more efficient almost immediately and increase revenue and efficiently over time 

7) you should be very anal about your cases. Say no to the cases that are not going to be profitable. If you want to help people or do pro bono keep that separate from your business. A business is only a business if it is profitable. Or else it’s a prison. 

8) focus on your business before paying any marketing, hiring people, etc.. you need to build the systems first, then invest in growth if you want. Having these systems will solve so many of the problems you mentions. 

Finally, remember the old bull/young bull story. Focus only on the case at a time. Slow if smooth and smooth is fast. So don’t be afraid to not answer phones. (Even better get an answering service).

> Hello, I know I’m late to this but this exact scenario is basically what I built my company around. I run a small, legal only answering service (Veza Reception), and a lot of our clients are criminal defense firms with high volume, short calls.

A couple quick thoughts whether you use us or not: you don’t need 24/7 out of the gate. Most solo attorneys just forward to us when they’re in court, truly slammed, or after hours, and let calls hit their cell the rest of the time. That way you’re not paying for every single call, but you’re also not losing good cases when you can’t pick up.

For costs, we bill by the minute (not per call), and we handle legal intake and basic conflict checks so you’re not jumping on the phone with people you can’t help anyway.

If you ever want to see what it would look like with your actual volume, I’m happy to set up a 2 week free trial and share the usage report so you can decide if it makes sense. You can DM me here or check us out at vezareception.com.

> There are different understandings of solo "success". For one category of practitioners, "huge success" means maximizing profit for minimal effort. For another category of practitioners, financial success is as meaningful as the quality of service provided; money is important, but not everything. People seeking the latter success should consider the following:

\#1 - Pick up the phone. Take your clients' calls. Take unknown calls (prospective clients). Do it.

\#2 - Have a client pipeline. If you don't have the connections yet to get referral work...try a combination of sources: (a) look for contract work in your discipline (small governments such as cities and counties, as well as non-profits, often outsource their legal needs); and (b) supplement your practice with a handful of private cases. The private cases are likely to make more money than the contract, so you'll be excited at how it supplements the contract income. The contract work might generate leads who want to hire you privately. Very symbiotic. 

\#3 - Bill monthly. If you don't bill, you don't have money. If you aren't disciplined about accounting, outsource this. 

\#4 - Be motivated to solve problems. When a question arises for which you don't know the answer -- try find and answer, make some phone calls. If you don't like working, learning, and researching, then you  shouldn't be a solo. 

\#5 - Invest in your own productivity and comfort. Keeping overhead super low is pointless if you your work is inhibited and/or you're frustrated all the time because you have to do things the tedious way. When deficiency of equipment / software / space is costing you, resolve it. Buy the reliable printer. Rent the office that you feel good sitting in day after day. 

\#6 - Make your own appearances. This is related to #1. Do your own initial consultations. Make your own court appearances. Clients don't want to hire your staff, they want to hire you. You might be thinking that if you do this, you won't have time to take on as many clients...and that might end up being true, but you can charge way more for time, because clients will see the quality difference. 

\#7 - Be organized. Your efficiency (time is money) depends on this. Accurate billing depends on this. Your sanity depends on this. 

\#8 - Demonstrate your \[high\] quality in small ways. When you're a hot mess, clients know you're the wrong lawyer. So be mindful about your clothes, office appearance, even the bumperstickers on your car. At your office, have water/tea/coffee available for visiting clients. Use nice business cards. Air sophistication. 

\#9 - Consider how other lawyers see you. Other lawyers will (or won't) be referring clients to you, based on what they know about you. What they see from you can mean a lot for your business. 

\#10 - Rest. Make sure you have the fuel to be successful in the first place. Make boundaries to preserve your down time. When a terrible hearing gets avoided by a great resolution...treat yourse

> Sure. I practice trademark law so it references that specifically.

Q: Can I send you long emails I generated with ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot? Can I send you ChatGPT's analysis of my legal problem?

A: Please don't use generative AI to write your emails to us. And please don't ask ChatGPT or another AI large language model (LLM) about your legal problem and paste the answer into your email to us. Whether you're a potential client or a current client, these kinds of emails make it really hard for us to do our jobs.  
    
Unlike most law firms, we don’t bill by the hour. Our flat fee model keeps our pricing competitive and transparent while allowing us to work efficiently. We are generally happy to answer any extra legal questions that you (our human client/prospective client) have for us, but we will not answer a string of nonsensical bullet points that you generated in a few seconds using ChatGPT.  
    
If we responded to everything our clients generated with AI, our business model would no longer work because we'd have to waste significantly more time on each project than we did before ChatGPT became popular. It's not fair to our other clients for us to spend so much time answering largely irrelevant questions that no human would ever think to ask us.  
    
The analysis offered by ChatGPT is almost never relevant to our clients' specific situations, and often isn't even relevant to the trademark application process at all. ChatGPT uses the web and other publications as its data sources, not real trademark application filing data. It seems to have no idea what you can and cannot include in a trademark application, or at what stage in the trademark process you should file an argument or petition against an existing trademark registration.  
    
ChatGPT is even worse at drafting emails asking us about the services we offer. AI-generated emails from prospective clients tend to include ten or so bullet points of questions that are answered right at the top of our website like "Do you offer flat-fee trademark filing packages?" and "Do any of your trademark packages include minor office action responses?" This kind of message does not benefit the sender or receiver.  
    
If you send us an email with a long list of bullet points that no human would have written before 2022, don’t be surprised if we reply by pasting this FAQ answer.

> Why wouldn’t you charge more for clients asking more questions? Answering questions takes time, and we bill by the hour. 

Even before Chat GPT was a thing, I had to train many an unsophisticated client in “how to efficiently use my services”, because if you call me 5 times a week to bounce a hair-brained idea off me that you dreamed up in the shower, or to ask the random questions you pondered up over drinks with your Uncle Joe who went through something similar back in the 80s, you can best believe I will bill you for those calls - or you could sit tight, let me do my thing, and we can discuss the issues or documents in an orderly and efficient fashion when we have our schedules appointment next week. 

Chat GPT is just a new variation on the same old problem, and advising clients that micromanaging drives up fees is not just telling them the truth - it’s doing them a kindness.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-10-25 | 1pts | `churn_billing, pricing` | Mentions: **OpenPhone**

> Yeah, VXT is a VoIP phone service designed for law firms that creates an ai summary and transcript. 

At the end of the call, it prompts you to tag the call to your practice management system with the matter number. 

It creates a call note in your practice management system with the transcript and summary and it creates a linked time entry that identifies the other party on the call.

I'm using both LEAP and Clio and am sending the notes and time entries to each platform.  I plan to ditch clio someday and am duping to leap and clio so that i don't have to migrate the data later. 

VXT works with many law practice management systems running the gamut from action step to Smokeball, Clio to Leap, and many others. 

If you go with an annual plan, it's $37.50 /user /month. On a month-by  -month plan it's $50/user/month. There’s an additional charge of $5 per phone number per month. But they tell me that one phone number can work for large firms with multiple users on separate calls simultaneously, so … I ported only one number and am dropping the other three I used for direct lines and a fax line. 

Over the past six years I've searched for and demoed several VoIP services and this is the best one I've found so far for a law firm. 

The other VoIP services I've looked at are really geared towards sales and call centers, rather than a law firm environment. 

To get them to create a communications log entry and a time entry most of them require either a third party connector or a zapier build. 

Homie ain’t got time nor patience for that. 

I've used DialPad for 2.5 years and i hate it. The interface is hard to navigate, i struggle to find calls in the call history, the call flow builder bites, it drops calls, the phone often doesn't ring and my staff just get a voicemail notification. 

Plus, dialpad within the past 6 months did something annoying that requires you to use a third party connector to send a communications log entry to clio. It doesn’t sync the ai summary. It just creates a blank communications log entry. 

 I never could get zapier to import the AI summary and Dialpad creates a separate time entry for each call participant and you then have to scrutinize the bill to ensure you’re not double or quadruple billing a call that involved multiple parties. 

Dialpad claims a low per user price of $25/month, but I get hit regularly with additional charges and fees that make the price comparable to or higher than VXT. 

Another VoIP I’ve found that designed for law firms is CORVUM. Lower cost, no frills interface that works with Clio. Its best feature is a text message billing module that creates a time entry based on the character count in a given day’s text exchanges with a particular number. 

But when i used it, CORVUM did not offer transcription and an ai summary. 

Before i switched to VXT I looked at over a dozen VoIP providers and created a “wet dream” list of features that a law firm VoIP needs and shouldn’t bother with. 

VXT rated bes

Everyone says they want what you want but nobody wants to pay for it. If so, I’d start a call center tomorrow to provide you with that service but you’d have to pay $6/minute, then  complain about the bill…lol

> Lawyer who owns an IT firm.  Not here looking for business, we only service Chicago.

These are the questions I wish people would ask me.  

1. What is the monthly flat fee amount.
2. What is and is not included.
3. What will you be billed for outside of the normal contract, i.e. office visits, computer setups, and so on.
4. Will they back up your office365 data?
5. What security products will they be using.
6. What is their response times (most lie) but have them write their answer in their contract
7. What software they will be using for remote access
8. How many other law firms do they represent
9. Do they understand your ethical obligations for duty of care and confidentiality
10. ISO27001 speaks to best practices for data security, ask them if they follow it internally and ask them if they will bring you into compliance
11. Ask them how they store your passwords internally.  ITGlue is the industry standard.
12. What is there strategy to help you guard against phishing.  It should include MFA using authenticator, changing your MS 365 sign in logo, flagging external emails, limitations on geographical logins, and a robust malware/phishing scanner that scans prior to the mail hitting your Outlook.  Windows Business Premium is really good at catching phishing.
13. How is any data on your laptop being backed up.

I hope this helps.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-10-12 | 3pts | `churn_billing, churn_general, pricing`

> At many firms, paralegals do a lot of work that gets billed at lawyer rates.  When a new file comes in and a paralegal reads the complaint, realizes that it looks like the last 3 lawsuits filed by the same plaintiff's firm, pull the last answer filed in another case, then adapts the prior answer to the instant facts and hands the attorney a rough draft answer, and the attorney spends an additional 30 minutes to edit the document, add additional affirmative defenses the entire thing might get billed out as if the attorney did the whole thing.  If that service allows that lawyer to more hours per day there is value in that.  

In our Low Cost of Living Market most court awarded judgments for attorney's fees have paralegals at $175 to $225 and hour and most parelgals earn $50k to 75k.  

You should either charge more for every paralegal hour or pay your paralegal less.  A $117k salary for a $132/hr billiable rate is awful  Once you are over 100k of compensation why not hire a lawyer who you could bill out at much more than $132/hr.

That said, to answer your inquiry, hourly billing will always be a part of the provision of legal services.

> Can I give you an outside opinion?  I'm an independent remote law clerk.  I service attorneys across the USA and a few solicitors in the UK.  (I'm a dual citizen and I went to law school in both countries) I've clerked in a few state courts and I've also worked for office of the Public Defender.  I'm barred with a couple tribal courts in CA and WI and do family court work there.  With respect to the attorney I work with, I am clerking remotely whilst I study the for the bar.  I'm also a mom and I enjoy working from home and traveling extensively over the summer and still being able to work.  I love this work.  And I love the prospect of working in the same capacity (with higher rates) once I pass a state bar.

The attorneys I work with are all solo or small firms.  I have been a remote clerk for the past 16 months and I work on an ad hoc basis.  Sometimes this means working with one attorney for 2 weeks at a time, then nothing for months.

The work I do is drafting motions, appeals, complaints and lots of discovery.  I'm Lexis-certified so I also do lots of legal research.  I have my own robust Lexis and Westlaw access.   I'm not sure if there's a big difference between what I do and what a paralegal does - but I do have 2 law degrees (USA & UK).  I don't do filing or anything in PACER and I don't really do admin tasks.  I mean, if asked, I probably would, but my rate varies between $75-$95 per hour, and I think it's more economical to get an admin assistant to do the admin work. Also, I am now so busy with work I've had to hire my own assistant to help project manage my services.

When I first work with an attorney, I focus on providing a quality work product.  From doing that consistently, trust is built.  Some attorneys hand over parts of cases to me; some attorneys will hand over an entire case.  It really depends what's needed.  I don't have a personal preference here.

I'm NEVER the attorney on record (as I'm not an attorney). I'm simply a ghostwriter.  I've set up my own LLC and my own website, specifically working as a law clerk.  Once I pass the bar I will probably need a new marketing strategy.  

So my advice to any attorney who is outsourcing:

1. Find someone that you think you may be able to trust.

2. Give them a small project first, build the trust.  Scrutinize their work product.  Is the quality as good or better than you would submit?

  
3. Ask them if they use AI.  Ask how they use it, how they ensure privacy.  Ask how they ensure their citations aren't hallucinations from the AI.  They should have solid answers for this.

4. Ask about the terms of payment.  I bill my attorneys weekly.  I charge hourly but for big projects I will give a flat fee rate.

5. Speak to them on the phone before you engage them to do work.  This is helpful.  Some of the attorneys I work with I've never spoken to them on the phone but the relationship still works.

6. Ask them about insurance -- especially if they are sign as the attorney on record.

> Totally hear you on that, and appreciate the advice. I’m trying to keep overhead manageable while getting started. Currently paying for Adobe, Microsoft, a fax service, Dropbox, and a few other essentials. I'm even considering adding a virtual answering service soon. That said, I do think it’s important to invest in something that can help me track cases, manage deadlines, issue invoices, and monitor payments, especially since I’m handling some civil litigation and criminal defense matters that are billed hourly. The tricky part is that choosing the right software isn’t exactly straightforward, it takes time to test out each one, and then you inevitably get hit with a wave of follow-up emails and sales calls.

> I’m a bit of an outlier, bad lsat, bottom 50 school, could not get into a top 250 firm.  But I’m doing well financially, nearly 20 years in, definitely worth it.   Ask me ten years ago, I was in a dead end in house job and would have definitely eventually gotten laid off and would have given you a different answer.  It sounds bad, but the beginning of your career you learn how to be a competent attorney, but the ones who make money are better at client and work generation.  And honestly, some of the best and sharpest legal minds I have ever worked with just suck at this and they end up working for someone else and their salary is capped on how much they can work. 

I have a family member in medicine and it’s a different life. If you are in a major city, MBA’s have taken over the medical profession and it’s kind of similar. You get paid a high salary and work your butt off.  Unlike law, you can go to more rural areas and get paid a lot more, but you will have to also work harder and with less resources.  Whereas law needs to typically stay close to where the action is to generate clients. 

One difference is that it is harder to be an entrepreneur in clinical medicine. In the old days you can set up a GP office and do well.  Less so today, MBA run clinics and insurance providers have all the power, the money route is to become a specialist and work for a hospital that can pay you.  The profession really got screwed by business people. Doctors are incredibly smart and hard working, but they got played.  

With law, you can at least create your own office still and learn how to find and build a practice and get clients.  With the rates that big firms have (and the quality of work received), the opportunity to undercut them is there for small and medium sized firms.  The same AI is being used by the associates in both firms, it’s just the billing rate that is different if you pay for brand name.  

So with what I know now, there is more opportunity in law for disruptive services and a better work life balance compared to other areas like medicine.  Not to mention that the entry level cost and time for medicine is much higher, so also cost out the lost income there.   If you are great at studying and just grinding and taking abuse, you can do well in both, but if you think you are more business minded and see law as a service to be sold, it can have more upside than medicine.

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.

They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney. We kept them as a virtual office with the phone line for too long and it just got worse over time.

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

> The short answer is, because the lawyer is typically signing the LOP saying that the client is getting the treatment in exchange for 100% reimbursement of the bills. 

I’m not saying you can’t negotiate off a LOP, but it makes it harder. If you are the lawyer, to negotiate the bills with an LOP, you have to say the case value turned out to be less than you hoped and so the doctor should take less than you promised they would get. I have never litigated one but I could easily see a doctor saying that the LOP is a contract that guarantees full payment and, therefore, it must be paid at 100%. 

Contrast this with a healthcare provider lien. A lien is a statutory right of reimbursement. Those are almost negotiable based on case value regardless of the amount of the lien compared to the settlement. The doc can’t say “you promised,” he/she/they can only say “the law promised.”  

Don’t forget, a US medical provider always has at least two ways to get paid after the services are rendered. First is based on contract.  They have all the remedies that contracts give anyone including collection actions and breach of contract claims. Lien is the second if there is a know PI case. They often don’t like the first because it is time consuming and recovery rates are low. They typically love liens because if the client is represented by a good PI lawyer, the doc is likely going to get paid and paid a lot more. Pushing for liens allows the client to get the treatment needed but does not completely handcuff you as the lawyer. And if the doc does not like the lien-based solution, remind them they can go for a breach of contract case. Suddenly, they like the lien.

### r/LawFirm — 2024-11-22 | 5pts | `churn_billing, pricing` | Mentions: **Smith.ai, OpenPhone**

> >Haven't focused on cost cutting/passing through to improve margin that way. More focused on developing talent and improving value.

  
i would focus here. increasing margin = less workload required to meet your financial goals + quality of life. 

here's a run down of how i'd design an ideal small firm:

tl;dr - invest in automation-friendly intake software (like lawmatics) and find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep).

PNC/intake:

* call answering - openphone or call answering like [smith.ai](http://smith.ai) or ruby reception
* lead intake & qual - get lawmatics
   * set up intake pipeline with forms that you (or receptionist service) can use to gather everything up front
   * automated EA prep, signatures & Invoicing with LawPay or LMPay
   * sync your calendar and put a consultation booking page on your website and as the primary url on every social account you use for business

case management:

* 2 options:
   * option 1: lawmatics service delivery pipeline
   * option 2: clio or whatever is the de facto for your verticals/practice areas
* identify bottlenecks in your prep:
   * find some AI do the most time-consuming parts of the case management (like doc prep, transcripts, deposition analysis, etc)

billing:

* rates - give everyone a fake discount by quoting a higher rate and then giving them the discounted rate. ex: tell everyone you normally charge $7500, but for them you'll do $5000. this is a neat psychological trick called anchoring that i've found works well universally.
* fee structure - ideally you can do fixed fee for fixed scope engagements but not all practice areas allow for that but maybe in your case some of aspects of your engagements can be fixed (e.g. discovery, deposition review, etc) while others that literally require you to be there are hourly (e.g. lititgation)
* invoicing - trigger invoicing on case progress milestones so you don't have to do it manually

  
compensation:

* for your employees – offer near-market rates for salary and benefits, add profit sharing based on individual and group revenue performance targets. being generous in this area attracts the best talent and allows you to retain them for longer, imo.
* for you – pay yourself a market rate, fixed salary ($250k or whatever is comfortable for your lifestyle) and then healthy bonuses based on firm performance regularly (quarterly so you get that sweet sweet dopamine for making a high-performing firm).

### r/LawFirm — 2024-10-03 | 1pts | `general`

> Hey everybody! This is Andy, one of the owners of SMB Team. First, I want to thank everyone for their comments here, including the constructive criticism!

I’d like to address some of the concerns raised in no particular order. Since this will be a longer post, I’d like to invite anyone with additional questions to email me at andy \[at\] smbteam \[dot\] com. I’m more than happy to hop on a call, answer your questions, and provide free marketing tips—no sales pitch, I promise.

First, I’ll be the first to admit that we’re not perfect. We’re a fast-growing company, and like many of the law firms we serve, our goal is always to deliver the best results possible. Sometimes, things don’t go as planned, but when they don’t, Bill (my business partner) and I do everything we can to address the situation quickly and effectively.

Almost all of our clients (nearly 600 law firms) have either my cell phone number or Bill’s, and we pride ourselves on being available. If any issues arise, we always encourage clients to reach out directly, and we’re committed to resolving concerns swiftly. We genuinely care about the outcomes our clients achieve.

I started the company in 2012 at my kitchen table, and Bill and I merged companies in 2022. We’ve since grown to around 130 employees, which comes with its own challenges. As anyone who has built a business knows, growing pains and staff turnover are part of scaling. While we work hard to maintain a strong culture, sometimes team changes are necessary to ensure the best results for our clients.

We’ve had to make tough decisions regarding staffing, but we believe those changes ultimately improve the experience and outcomes for our clients. It’s never easy, but we are constantly learning and improving as we grow.

Regarding some comments about our services being similar to other marketing companies: we offer a broad range of services that go beyond marketing, including fractional CFO, fractional COO, bookkeeping, and intake support. Our approach is holistic, addressing every key area of law firm growth—consistent lead generation, intake systems, building a strong team, and financial planning. This sets us apart because we’re focused on long-term, sustainable growth, not just marketing.

I’m also proud to say that every success story, review, and testimonial we share is 100% real. We’ve never paid anyone to provide a testimonial or fabricated a case study, as that’s both unethical and unnecessary given the results our clients have achieved.

Lastly, I’ve noticed that some comments are from people who haven’t worked with us directly, which tells me we have more work to do in educating the broader legal community. Our goal is to help as many lawyers as possible, whether they choose to work with us or not. That’s why we share so much free content, from over 1,700 YouTube videos to various free and paid events. Whether you hire us or not, I’m committed to helping as many law firm owners as possible grow their firms.

> I'm an attorney and do IT consulting for lawyers.  We specialize in small practices.  Here are some of the things I have learned over the years.  I have toying with the idea of doing a weekly tech live chat just to answer questions.

* Be prepared to do a lot of business stuff.  I have had a couple small and solos go back in house because they were just "tired of running a business" Others, really love the business part.  It isn't overly complex but it does take up time.  
* Set your tech up right and automate as much as you can.  There are a lot of good posters on this subreddit who give amazing advice.  Gusto for payroll and taxes, FreshBooks for time tracking and payment, QuickBooks online, Office 365 and so on.  Partner up with a good tech support company in your area.  *Make sure they use a program to backup Office365 for you*
* Cashflow is king, so work out how you will bill the client.  Local rules may determine your options.  I take our fee prior to the month of service.  I have seen some firms that will send an invoice and then auto bill a credit card at determined period of time, unless there is a complaint with the invoice.
* Costs and taxes will always be more than you anticipate.  You will have to pay more in taxes than you think.
* Try to get your contacts and mail exported from your old firm.  Partners usually get this.  Your professional contacts will be critical
* Make sure you have thought through your sales pipeline so that you always have new cases coming in.  Most partners leaving firms know their practice and know how to make it rain, so you will probably be fine.

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck, owning a business is amazing but it takes a lot effort.

> I really liked that Daylite was offline with a sync.  I know when I fire it up on my phone or tablet it will be there.  Clio requires a constant internet connection.  I also liked Daylite mail attachment as Clio’s is so slow as to be virtually unusable.  There’s also little things like being able to link a person or a project (matter) with a calendar date.  Clio only links matters to  calendar dates.  I dunno, I sometimes think about going back, but the billing aspects of Clio make me overlook the CRM’s flaws compared to Daylite.  And as previously stated Billings Pro sucks and one is just waiting for Marketcircle to announce that they won’t support it anymore. 

Clio customer service is also better.  They have live people to answer calls where everything with Daylite is done via email.  Sometimes that was frustrating even though I cannot fault Marketcircle’s response time overall.

> What kind of cases are you looking for.  Avoid the high dollar high competition stuff.  Sure there is good potential returns there - but you can bleed yourself dry fighting the bot spam that just eats up your dollars on pay to play stuff.  Find a good source of fee for service work - severance package review? record sealing? contract review? hoa disputes? general counsel stuff that pays the bills monthly and gives you a baseline.  Plenty of these are low dollar low competition.  Avoid "best PERSONAL INURY LAWYER" that can cost 500 dollars a click and with a few bad actors kill your budgets and give you no conversions.  You need to generate more reviews than your near peer competitor by like 2:1.  You don't even need to do work to get a good review.  Find them a good referral, send them to the self help center, be nice to take 2 minutes on the phone and help them out without providing too much and boom 5 stars.  There is just so many little low hanging fruit type things that you can do that get your name out there.  Tip staff well and leave a card.  Tell everyone that you are a lawyer.  Give your staff bonuses to refer cases and have them all tell everyone they are a lawyer.   I have been growing a firm for a year and a half - our organic traffic used to be under 200 a month on google, it's over 12,000 now and been growing like a weed.  We have a full time in house call center to handle the call volume.  We try to find a home for every call.  Something comes in that we don't do - were referring it to someone we know that does that and saving them some time searching the internet more.  Those referrals come back full circle.  Happy to answer any questions and point you in the right direction.  DO NOT JUST BLINDLY TRUST MARKETING COMPANIES.  You need to know your way around the ad accounts and make sure they arent wasting money on leads that you arent interested in.  Google has gotten bad and exact match keywords have become more broad and the broad stuff has just become an asterisk for whatever google wants.  You will see that you have to manage negative keyword lists daily or you are burning dollars.  Ad companies and google arent going to come give your refunds.  Keep your finger on the pulse of what every dollar is doing and how you are measuring those results through call data or lead data or chats or forms or email.  Whatever it is - those leads that don't convert are lost opportunity, unless you follow-up with them with ongoing email campaigns, friendly reminders, helpful blogs, etc.

Are you being billed out at market rate for your services and are you/did you hit your billables target set for you by the firm?

If the answer to that compound question is yes, there's absolutely no reason for them to not treat you "normally" in regards to compensation.  


If the answer is not unequivacal on both of those elements, it's up to pure negotiation for you to advocate why it makes sense to give you more money.

> I searched through my post history to find my response to a similar post a few years ago. I graduated 10 years ago and also had a ton of trouble getting my first job.

>In Canada, where I live, you are required to article before you can be called to the bar - basically a 10 month apprenticeship with a qualified lawyer.  
  
What worked for me - made a huge lists of firms in my city that I was interested in. Sent out a personalized cover letter with a copy of my transcript, resume, and references to the most senior person at each firm. In my email I said I would follow up with a call next week. Probably sent out 50 -75 applications this way. Then I’d follow up each day with a telephone call to the firms on my list, crossing out the ones that weren’t interested.  
  
Some were rude but most were surprising nice and were happy to chat. Some recommended other firms or put me in touch with other lawyers they thought might be hiring. Some agreed to meet me for a cup of coffee just to chat. I got 3-4 interviews from firms that had no plans to hire but liked my application and my enthusiasm. I botched a couple of them but all you need is one. I ended up articling at a 10 lawyer firm with a solid reputation. It ended up being a horrible place to work but I got called and then moved on to better things.  
  
Everyone that met with me said they got dozens of resumes a week but I was the only one that actually called (and called continuously). One lawyer who never answered his phone eventually agreed to meet me if I would stop calling him (he never told me to stop, was just screening my calls).  
  
At the time I was searching for articles there was an articling crisis like never before - a lot of new grads couldn’t get jobs. With the shortfall in articling positions it meant every job posting had hundreds of applicants. I found this was a good way to get myself in front of some firms that weren’t even interviewing anyone else.

&#x200B;

A couple other comments on reflection:

1. While I applied to job postings, I didn't focus so much on those - I figured they were getting hundreds of other applicants who were also vying for their attention. Looking back I don't know if it would have been better to focus more on these firms or not.
2. Articling students generally aren't paid a ton -  I wonder if this factored into my ability to get interviews with firms that weren't actively hiring. Like taking me on wasn't going to be a big expense. 
3. I spent an insane amount of time perfecting my covering letter and resume. I had heard that any mistake in them was reason for a potential employer to pass on me. Now I hire articling students and employees myself - I barely glance at the cover letter and just care about the substance of the resume. I don't eliminate anyone for minor formatting or other errors. Maybe if we had hundreds of qualified applications I would though? I did get at least 2 interviews from lawyers that really liked the writing in my cover let

> It is extremely rare for an attorney to conduct a call with no prior preparation whatsoever. I don't think I've ever conducted a call without spending at least 15 minutes beforehand refreshing my memory and reviewing notes. That's another reason why you might get billed 45 minutes or an hour for only a 30 minute call. Depending on how complex the issues are, it's not uncommon for attorneys to spend more time preparing for a call than actually conducting the call. Clients expect lawyers to come to a call with answers. It takes preparation to arrive at those answers.

I don't know what the default is if a formal engagement letter has not been signed, but I would expect that a court would treat the situation as one of fairness. You asked the lawyer for a service, she provided it, everyone be reasonable.

> The most honest answer if being practical on it is a combination of working on many different matters each day and the rounding up of time based on the usual .1 hour increments. All the more basis of there being a general notion of not billing for just .1 to a matter in one day. It's all BS and dumb when you get down to it. I used to do work on antenna license matters and could be juggling 15 or more at a time. If I shot out an email for each checking to status each weekday, despite it only taking 20 min or less to blast those out it would end up, according to protocol 3 hours. Naturally, can't do that all the time but merely as an example of filling in the time. 

Personally, I'm at the stage of my career and at a place where ultimate collections rather than billable hours is the measuring stick so it has its own host of considerations when prioritizing and tracking down work (if not servicing my own clients).

> If you have work coming in then it's never too early to hire.

Start by hiring an assistant to answer phones, set up consultations, handle intake and opening a new case file. This person, if they have a nice personality, can also handle client inquiries, answer (non-legal) questions, and take messages.

As time progresses you will train the assistant to prepare documents from templates, and how to file with the court. Of course you review pleadings before approving a filing, but having someone to prepare documents and organize files is a big deal.

As you grow, the assistant may also help with billing tasks. I would recommend a separate bookkeeper or accountant to actually handle the money, but an assistant can make sure that billing statements and requests for payment go out on time to keep your money coming in.

I consider a paralegal to be a separate position. There is a lot of blurring between roles and tasks, but a good paralegal should be able to talk to clients, do legal research, and draft substantive legal arguments for your review. An untrained assistant who doesn't know legal  can not be expected to do those things. 

Some attorneys will hire a person to do intake interviews, which is kind of like a consultation but without giving legal advice. The purpose is to vet the client, assure them that your firm can take care of their matter, give them an idea of what to expect next, and get them to sign up and make a deposit of funds (for hourly work). This is like a sales role and is kind of advanced in terms of training required. 

Admin work? 

Use a service like Gusto to handle employee pay. 

Set up a separate account at your bank that's just for payroll.

Make a checklist of tasks that new employee will have to do. One of new employee's jobs will be to expand the checklist with "how-to" descriptions for everything they do. This document will be come the manual for your law office, so that new hires can refer to it, and so that you can edit and correct any mistakes in employee assumptions or conduct. 

Helpful to offer a lower hourly rate for training pay, then rate bumps up after new hire can complete tasks A, B, and C. Don't make the tasks too hard or the employee will think you're playing games. A bump in pay will come for demonstrating they can reliably do tasks G, H, and I. 

New employee has to understand confidentiality, conflicts, and the difference between legal information and legal advice. Tell them "when in doubt refer questions to the attorney!" "Don't make predictions or give legal advice!"

Have them sign a confidentiality agreement. Prepare a welcome letter in advance, that spells out terms of employment and probably emphasizes that the position is "at-will" employment. 

All of the topics I've mentioned here are the subjects of numerous books, webinars, training programs, business coaches, etc. This post is intended just to get you thinking.

> It’s ridiculous. I’m pretty new to this game and am only now learning that judges do not actually care about the law. They do what they want. 

Story time:

Civil matter - foreclosure. Defendant (borrower) did not reply to the petition that was properly served. Default judgement was granted and sheriff sale date was set. One week before the sale, the defendant gets a lawyer. The sale is postponed and a motion to dismiss the judgement is filed based on an allegation of improper/insufficient service. Also included in the filing was 7 pages of straight BS reminding the court that it had the power to grant the dismissal. 

I went to the hearing and factually destroy the service allegations. I told the judge there was no legal basis to grant the motion to dismiss nor was there an equitable basis because the defendant still had every avenue available to redeem the property. Further, I told the judge that granting the motion would set a precedent that people could avoid paying their bills, service, etc. and delay the process simply by finding a lawyer willing to knowingly make up an allegation and file an answer. 

The judge said that she agreed with what I said but she was granting the motion because “they have a lawyer now.”  I asked for the legal or equitable basis for the ruling. She yelled at me and said she will do what she pleases and what she feels is right regardless and the defendant has a lawyer so they should get more time. I argued and asked why my client should continue to go without payment and continue to pay the taxes and insurance while the defendant lives there for free and that treating my client differently just because they are a bank isn’t following the law. She got mad and yelled that I could “take her up and just see what happens.” She knew I wasn’t going to appeal and she let me know that the actual law means absolutely nothing - they do what they want for whatever reason they want. 

So if you get yelled at, just smile and nod and get out of there as quickly as you can, realizing the judge is probably just a power tripping asshat with insecurities who probably hasn’t been laid in months. 

Yes. I’m still pissed off at realizing that the law doesn’t matter.

Google drive for storing PDFs. I also use an answering service for all my calls. They connect new leads but take messages for everyone else. I get back to everyone same day so no one has bitched about the having to leave a message yet. Lawmatics integrates with the answering service so if I can’t answer they just schedule a consult and create a “matter” with the lead’s contact info and some brief notes. 

Once I get an admin I won’t use all of the above but since I’m pure solo, the cost is worth it. The above is about $1200 per month but compared to an employee I think it makes sense. I have a virtual office and am paperless so these are my third biggest expense behind advertising and health insurance.

> I’ve used Clio for 3+ years and now hate it. 

Calendaring sucks. Color coding is lame, you can’t set a template for reminders, and several other shortcomings. 

Tasks in Clio are an afterthought. 

Clio Grow blows and integrates poorly with Clio manage. Grow’s tedious form builder you can’t build a form such that a client can enter useful information, e.g. witness names / addresses / age / expected testimony, because to gather such information in the form you have to program the form to obtain info about a pre-existing contact. 

In Grow you should be able to create custom fields as you build an automated document. 

No. 

First you must create custom fields. Surely you can create custom fields while building an intake form ! Right?

No. 

You can, but should not, creat custom fields in Grow at all. 

Stupidly, a custom field created with Grow will not import into Manage. 

So…
You create custom fields in Manage, import those custom fields into Grow, link form fields to the custom fields, and then build the automated document. 

I paid Clio to build intake forms at $50 each for 5 areas of law.

Pretty forms. Good data. But…

The forms asked for times, dates, integers, contact cards, picklist responses, multiple choice answers, yes/no responses, radio buttons, etc. 

All incompatible with both the Grow document automation tool and with Manage altogether. 

So, pretty, useless forms contained data that I had to cut-and-paste or re-type, which was the very evil I sought to avoid by biting into Clio so that I could automate. 

I’ve spent DAYS with Clio tech support calls and Clio remand Bo better than Microsoft outlook or Google Workspace. It does billing, but WiseTime, Bill4Time, and others do billing at a lower point. 

Often, One tech support person has told me to do steps 1,2, and 3 to unlock a Clio capability. Several hours later I run into a hiccup, call tech support, and another tech support person tells me I should have done it differently from the start.

Wasted time, money, and effort. 

After several sessions with Clio development teams to resolve basic issues and explain what a lawyer needs to leverage CLIO and the data lawyers need to store in such a tool I am going to fire Clio and opt for a better solution. 

Clio has neither provided the service promised nor made my work easier. 

When I’ve emailed the CEO about my issues i get pawned off to another time-wasting tech support “expert” or development team. 

Clio lacks pre-built, automated court forms, intake forms, and data collection templates. 

I’ve created thousands of custom fields, several dozen automated documents, and it’s been a waste. 

During your Clio free trial find a product that has pre-built data collection and automated documents. 

Smokeball and LEAP look superior to Clio. If they don’t already have the document or form you need,  LEAP and Smokeball will take your existing form, letter, document, or pleading and automate it. 

LEAP has a large, expanding body of cour

> We have similar problems.  I also have more work coming in than I can handle and live in a rural-ish area where it's difficult to attract attorneys.  They would rather live in the HCOL big city making 30% less than live in a LCOL mid-size 300k town.  Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about other people's poor choices.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I did a few things:   First I raised my rates.  You will lose less clients than you think.  Clients who pay more are generally easier to work with and respect you more since you charge more so you must be good.  It's silly but that's just how it is.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I got more picky.  You really need to look at how many people 'touch' your matters to determine the true overhead cost.  I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Third, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.  They're good at pointing out flaws but not so good at fixing them so far in my experience.

> This is a terrible idea. Don’t even consider it. Run. 


Source: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer 

Okay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn’t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:


The only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. 

You will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. 


*Why hours on just this?*


Because a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you’ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you’ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). 

This will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. 


*How do you bill 2100?!?!*


Oh boy… you will hear the phrase “capture your time” and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don’t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you’ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn’t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn’t billable and will add up as you’re learning). 


If the mind numbing work and hours don’t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS

You can’t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It’s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. 


ID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate

> Let me clarify. The high anxiety comes from a number of factors, that when all combined, tends to increase the anxiety levels. 1. New cases in the pipeline, 2. Budgets, 3. Client demands (whether ppl here admit it or not, u r ur clients, attorney/therapist/medical liaison/ financial planner/ person they will vent to about whatever and some require hand holding.) 4. Managing the endless problems other parties throw your way all in the name of maximizing the value you get on your case (I.e billing departments, managing experts etc). And 5) ordinary litigation stressors (which isn’t too bad). 

Those PI attorneys that you are referring to as having less stress have probably built their practices up where they have a robust staff that can address all of the things I listed above. But anyone worth their a damn will tell you, building a PI practice and generating business requires more than sitting in an office answering discovery, motions and doing deps. 

PI is incredibly profitable. But its a business first. And most ppl mess up bc they don’t appreciate the demands servicing clients places on someone. While also joggling all the other stuff.

> I took over a practice that had completely died. "400" existing patients, actually turned out to be 15 people... I didn't pay much for it at all... Basically free 

The way I thought about it was that it was a startup with an existing floor plan, outdated equipment that could be turned over as needed, and a few patients to help pay the bills. 

2 years later, starting up this fee for service practice, I wish the practice had a little bit more cash flow to begin with. It's tough.. very tough. 

You can find me me doing hygiene, scheduling appointments, answering phone calls, marketing, sterilization, lab work, radiographs, impressions, clean up, you name it.... Just about everything.

> Regretting becuase income? Regretting because how hard it is to learn skill? Regretting because of what?

Nothing matters for a new dentist but people and dental skills. 

Dental skill for a new grad takes many repetitions and 5 years to grasp. If you have a hard time please practice on extracted teeth and watch YouTube how skills. 

There are so many dentists especially new ones who were never taught people skill and have very few dental skills which together causes your sentiment of regret ever choosing this field. Absolutely nothing else 

People skill? 

Some even say that I want to spend "quality" time with pt and get to know my pt. The question is does that patient want or care to know you? Why do you think pt want and care to know you? Do you ever say that you want to get to know the waiter or cook at a restaurant?Such misplaced mentality. No, you went to a restaurant to eat. Dental patient came to you to get their teeth improved. Nothing else. They do not want to be your best friend. They dont care to be your friend.  

How do we choose a restaurant? Online review, word of mouth refer. Do we know how they cook it or what ingredients was used? You know the answer. All we know as a customer of food service is how the food tasted, price and the service. Same with dental service, all they know is .... If you are a good dentist like Tommy then you would, should know exactly what dental patient want. Take care of them on the spot and "never" refer. If you are good then the price become secondary. All of us would spend more for good food. 

I am an introvert. Anything I say and do when I walk in the front door was an act which stayed with me over the years which intend to make patient feel comfortable. 

The arm movement, the things I say, the voice volume the way I look at patient…. All Great customer service and hand skill & speed are how you get over the new bill so you have new patients coming in as well repeating patients. Affordability of patient can be overcome when patient actually like us and when OMs use their magic. Most people do not have perfect teeth therefor it depend on whether you treatment plan those needs and able to take care of those needs.

> Better be checking and double checking that you are indeed getting all of the procedural credit- most times things are missed and you get paid less because of it if you get a %of production or collection and the other doc be profiting off of your work. 
Three months should have been plenty of time for Credentialing to have been completed if they submitted your paperwork when you started or prior to. Most insurances state 90d  although it usually takes 30. Going out of network is a whole different ballgame- best believe they will take their 90d to uncredential. 

Technically it could be considered insurance fraud under the False Claims Act and prompt an audit and fines if reported under certain circumstances. It depends. Are they billing under an individual NPI or a group NPI? What do the individual insurance contracts allow for? Is it an insurance that specifically states the services can only be performed by contracted providers? May want to look into the answer to at least these questions. Or contact an attorney in your state now that you know it’s happening and ask them.

> I'm partly being a wise ass. Partly looking to ruffle some feathers. Because here, you can say things you can't say at like a CE for example.

But, shit.  I've been at this for 20 years.  I started as an associate in PPO.  I called it the crown factory. It was unwritten, but if you wanted to be successful, and there was a pfm that was looking just a little iffy, and it was over the 5y mark, it was not long for this world.  That office didn't balance bill a lot, so it was easy.  We did good work.  But, we did A LOT of it.

Now I work in FFS.  No insurance.  I honestly don't give a shit if I do 1 implant the whole day because my two rooms of hygiene at 350 - 400 bucks a pop (give or take, depending on what they're due for) keeps me doing just fine.

I hardly treatment plan anything.  I never sell.  People have written online that I "actively try not to push extra services on the patients."  We don't.  I have low student loan debt at 1.6%. I own my building.  I literally have no pressure. 

And constantly, I get people come in for a second opinion, coming from a in network place, or worse, a DSO, with 8 cavities tx planned.  I usually find none.  Maybe 1.

I think it sucks, but it's the answer to the op's question.  They want to know when the production comes in.  Well, it comes in when.... you produce.  How do you produce?  You sell, and you drill.  OR, you charge a shit ton for each procedure, and you drill once in a while.

> For me, it's about a few things:

1. I get better support from customer service, tech support, etc from straumann or nobel than I might with Implant direct.

2. Straumann and Nobel have been around for 30 years, and they are going to be around for 30 more.  Can you say the same for the other companies? Short answer is no. If you have to restore a now defunct brand, that's no fun.

  
3. A patient with a Straumann or Nobel can get it restored with relatively little fuss in any state and pretty much any country.  Before Neodent was bought by Straumann, this was harder for Neodent being a Brazilian company.

  
4. Cost is the point. If I'm charging 3k for a crown but I pay $99 for the lab fee, that doesn't feel great. It's like getting your Car repaired - If I go to a mechanic to get my car fixed and its a $1000 bill and I see the breakdown of cost and the parts were $950 and labor was $50, I'm going to think I got a great deal.  If the Parts were $50 and labor was $950, I'll think I got ripped off.  Human nature works like this. I can charge $2600 to place a $600 implant much easier than I can charge $2050 to place a $50 implant even though I get paid the same.

  
5. It's what I would get in my own mouth.

> Are you even a dental professional? 

Dental offices do charge both the patient and their insurance if the insurance doesn't pay for 100% of the treatment. You'll be quite surprised how people miraculously forget, on the spot, that dental offices provide something called an, "estimate" of coverage for procedures. Billing and dealing with insurance benefits is an incredible administrative burden. 

Do you think it's fun when we can't access an insurance company's website to check your insurance benefits on your behalf because of a website outage? Do you think it's fun when you have to wait for long periods of time for customer service to pick up the phone and answer your question? Imagine having to do that in a high volume office where you lose a lot of money writing things off because some patient is haggling over five dollars that wasn't covered by their insurance.

Yes, not all dental offices charge equally. Whether it be due to their speciality/services provided, or they are an HMO, PPO, fee for service (cash) office, there will be disparity in the fees. You have less invasive treatments like dental fillings costing hundreds of dollars more than the average because a patient wants to be IV sedated. All that additional equipment and staff costs money. Not all insurance companies pay and provide coverage equally.

However, they require much higher level of examination, history taking and knowledge to do correctly. If you don’t know how to take a proper medical symptom history, you’re chances of misdiagnosing and providing ineffective treatment are high. Orofacial pain and dysfunction has an almost completely opposite split on patient education and procedure itself. Dentistry is 20% education and management and 80% procedure based. Orofacial pain is the opposite and I have numerous patients that are 100% education, behavior modification and management. Collecting on this type of treatment is difficult unless you’re cash only or taking medical insurance, which does pay for office visits and consultations. Unfortunately, dental insurance is very poorly equipped to handle Orofacial pain treatment protocols currently. I think it’s great to add trigger points  and Botox to your tool box, but realize that you can’t just do them and expect the patient to improve as it’s the other 80% that will make them better long term. As an example, Botox does absolutely nothing for long term improvement of muscle pain. It’s a band-aid that reduces force generation in the muscle and reduces pain temporarily. However, without that 80% of education and management, you’re gonna end up with patients in pain again and getting angry that your “treatment” didn’t help them. You have to have a better answer than “just do it every 3 months forever.” Reducing pain is very good thing I do hold back Botox from my patients, but everyone one of them know how to make their muscle pain better before they leave the office and knows that they will be on a revolving fire of Botox injections every 3 months if they don’t do it.

any good ways of finding orofacial pain specialists in our respective areas? Besides large academic centers, idk where to find you guys.

> HEADS UP: This is long....but from the heart. 

Many Doctors ARE arrogant, and act highly offended if a patient asks questions about their treatment. That's the reaction patients are put off by. 

Unfortunately,  many patients mistakenly believe Doctors know EVERYTHING about the science behind ALL of the products they use. So their questions,  I believe, are from a place of innocence, not challenge or suspicion.

Think of a way to answer questions you have no answer for in a way that will assure them & quiet them down, but not lose faith/trust in you. It's a slippery slope. You, the doctor, have to assess the situation.  

And yes, patients may ask questions about things beyond their pay grade; while being mindful of your time, ask if they want the long or short answer and go from there.

If they question EVERYTHING, perhaps you need to offer to schedule a consultation appointment (cash) with a knowledgeable staff member to go over the complete treatment plan and provide a handout with answers to basic innocuous questions.  That way you're not taking up chairtime or taking too much of the Doctors' time away from patients. 

I've done that many times. It's actually quite fun. 

Perhaps the patient could be required to submit a list of questions so the Doctor can answer the questions beforehand.  

Having demonstration typodonts, visual diagrams/drawings and other teaching aids is helpful too. 

In one office I worked in we had a special consultation room just for this purpose.  Every patient got one.

Just remember too much information leads to information overload. 

Simply explain you'd love to address their concerns, and need to set up an appointment (probably not covered by ins) to do that. Here are the fees.....are you interested? PIF is expected at time of appointment. Otherwise you can answer simple, basic questions as they arise. 

Personally,  I'd  recommend no less than 45 mins to an hour so they don't feel rushed. Plus, if it's not the Doctor giving the presentation,  you won't have to charge as much to where it might be cost prohibitive.  

If they start asking too many "deep" questions,  simply explain the person doesn't have a dental license and can't give medical/ dental advice.....only what the Dr. has authorized her to share. 

There's a saying that goes something like......
Most people won't remember what you did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel. 

Make your patients feel valued, appreciated, special and worthy of your time. I'll bet their beaming feelings will be included in their referrals.  

You never know who might be walking through you dental office doors next.  

Yes, it requires lots of time & pampering, but look at how super successful dental practices are known to go way above & beyond for those who want it and are willing to pay for it.  However, a good billing coder might find ways to get insurance to pay for some of these services.

> Our default policy is you get one free pass per ~5 year period as long as your reason seems legitimate and apologetic in tone. We modify that by the patient. If they have been coming for 8 years reliably, pay their bills, friendly, etc. I’m more forgiving. If we believe excuses like my spouse died, I have Covid, etc. we don’t even count that as their one freebie. 

We reiterate our 24 hour business day policy (Sunday for Monday doesn’t count as notice for us) nearly all cancellation calls and before booking anything over 1.5 hours.

Invariably, someone winds up with multiple under 24 hour cancels/no shows. We charge a $75 cancellation when it happens and require deposits of 1/2 the planned tx for the appointment. When they complain, and they always do, the front is told to tell them only the dentist can remove the charge and would they like to speak with me. If I’m not currently available, they get a call back number for that day. I always take the call or call them back…if they are too emotional/irrational to listen, I have the staff get their number whether I am available or not so they cool down some.

Most people just don’t understand the business structure. We’re not like Walmart with a cashier standing there for whatever comes in. I explain that I or the hygienist reserve special time for just them. When they call at the last minute, I still have to pay that hygienist and assistant to just sit there and do nothing as I have no opportunity to get someone else in that we can help. I tell them everyone wants dentistry to be less costly and that this is the number one thing that makes it cost more and we are trying to keep their costs down. They invariably say something about $75 being too much. I then tell them the precise number of times they did it and to think of it instead as $/each time and how we graciously gave them multiple passes before. Then it’s the, “yeah but this time my house flooded!” (Which is usually a bs made up answer if they didn’t start with it in which case we likely would have accepted the excuse and moved on before I’m involved) in which case I answer I’m very sorry to hear that, but your house didn’t flood the other 14 times and I have to draw the line somewhere. Sometimes I will pull out the this has to be a mutual respect relationship. You love that I never leave you sitting in my waiting room more than 6 minutes because I respect your time, you must respect my time as well….and you aren’t. I rarely reverse the charge because I give my well-trained front the latitude to assess the situation and decide whether to go down the charge or deposit path.

I’ve never had a bad review over it, which frankly surprises me as this has been my approach for nearly 10 years. Probably lost some patients over it though, but I don’t want those patients. Let them mess up someone else’s schedule. I tell them that too when they threaten to leave (I’d love to continue being your dentist, but honestly I would rather you find another provid

> NAD, this isn’t the answer you’re looking for but offering a pov from someone with dental defects. I’d suggest looking into medical billing and coding for oral healthcare. 

There’s such a lack of knowledge in this area at practices and most dentists are afraid to tackle medical insurance/suggest the patient to do it. 

There are lots of CPT that are mirror to CDT codes beyond implants or bone grafting etc. Even restorations are truly considered prosthetics. 

Dental care is not an essential benefit, but congenital defects are and habilitation services for functional impairment. Someone with a peg lateral has a birth defect so a crown is considered prosthetic intervention and can be argued to medical insurance that the primary purpose is to correct congenital defects. 

At this point you wouldn’t even need to have a contract with the insurance yet because you can have patients petition you in network under network gap exception. There’s no other dentist, perio, or pros doing this so the network doesn’t have a provider. You then can work with a rep or have the patient ask about the max allowable amounts to figure out your rates. 

Beyond that, there’s also just preventative services, X-rays, cbct scans, services related to dental caries that all have icd-10 codes and cpt codes. 

The reason why I’m suggesting this as a business opportunity. Because being the only practice that does this could be a big deal.

On top of that, the ELSA Act is hopefully going to pass Congress this year. So a lot of dental practices won’t even know about this legislation let alone the insurance they could be using to help patients from it 

Final and last point, dental insurance has gotten ridiculous at this point. Between them covering nothing, the push for corporate dental chains, the ridiculously low out of pocket maximums, and the low contracted amounts it’s an archaic institution where medical insurance could be the future of oral care.

### r/Dentistry — 2023-02-08 | 2pts | `churn_billing`

> We were about 60% Delta. Since Delta doesn’t accept assignment (at least in our state) from out of network providers we now collect payment in full at time of service and the reimbursement check goes directly to the patient. That has eliminated any follow up on unpaid claims. We do bill for the patient electronically, but after that we have no further involvement in if they get paid. (Unless more info is requested or something clinical we need to submit)The pt has to call Delta to follow up on payment for themselves. So that is a massive time saver. And we found most of our patients didn’t mind paying at time of service(in full) they just really didn’t want to have to bill Delta. Once they realized we were still billing for them they were fine with it. 

We we have much better customer service and quality of care  because we have less patients we see in a day. We have increased the amount of quality time we can spend with each patient and not feel rushed. Our employees aren’t as stressed running around and it shows in their more personal interactions with the patients. 

Happy to answer any questions, anytime. Good luck!

> For posterity, here is their full comms to customers:




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dear Customer,

As announced, VoIPo will be ceasing operations effective August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Our top priority is to make sure that you have minimal disruption and that your phone number is easily transferred to a new provider. We highly recommend VoIP.ms, an established telecommunications provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers. The VoIP.ms team is ready to help and has taken several steps to make sure things are seamless for you. We believe VoIP.ms will provide you with excellent service, customer support, and competitive rates.

With that said, we understand you might have pressing questions concerning your account, the reason we are shutting down operations and billing issues. We have prepared some questions and answers we believe are more urgent concerning this matter.

 

General Questions

Q: Why is VoIPo ceasing operations? 

A: Due to challenging market conditions, significant financial losses, and a key vendor disrupting our ability to process credit cards or issue refunds, we can no longer operate. This was a hard and difficult decision made after exploring all available options.

Q: When exactly does my VoIPo service end?

A: All VoIPo telecommunications services will permanently cease on August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.

Q: What if I have billing or other questions about my old VoIPo account?

A: VoIPo will provide limited support through closing via e-mail at support@voipo.com.

Q: When should I start migrating to another provider?

A: Immediately. The sooner you begin, the smoother your transition will be, otherwise you might suffer longer service interruptions.

Q: What do I do with my VoIPo adapter?

A: VoIPo is not requiring the return of any equipment. You may use the equipment with VoIP.ms (or any other provider) if they support it or dispose of/recycle it.

 

Migration to VoIP.ms Questions

Q: Can VoIP.ms access my VoIPo account to help?

A: No. VoIP.ms cannot access your VoIPo account information or resolve VoIPo-related issues.

Q: Why is VoIPo recommending VoIP.ms?

A: VoIP.ms is a well-established provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers, excellent service quality, competitive pricing, and the technical capability to handle VoIPo customer migrations smoothly. Learn more about VoIP.ms right here: https://migration.voip.ms/voipo.

Q: Will VoIP.ms honor VoIPo's rates/contracts?

A: No. VoIP.ms operates independently with their own pricing and terms. However, their rates are competitive and often lower than industry standards. See https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost and https://voip.ms/pricing. 

Q: Will my current equipment work with VoIP.ms?

A: Most equipment will work with VoIP.ms, but will need reconfiguration (ie. factory reset). VoIP.ms built this extensive knowledgebase article to h

> You're right; if the numbers were ported in (to any carrier, not just GV) and later abandoned/deleted, they would eventually return to the carrier to which they were originally assigned.  If the previous carrier was T-Mobile, and the numbers were originally issued to T-Mobile by NANPA, then they'd go back to T-Mobile, not Google's carrier partner.

But to answer your first/original question, the "housekeeping" around ported numbers can  get sloppy.  The numbers may just sit forever on Google's carrier until/unless T-Mobile somehow requested/took them back. 

Google isn't doing this for any useful purpose or logical reason or malice.  It's just sloppiness.  Since consumer GV users aren't paying for their service, it's harder to keep track when numbers are no longer being used (bills would stop getting paid).

> Currently stuck with a local VoIP provider that’s decent at best and “meh” at worst. It worked fine for a while, but now we’re running into issues they don’t care to fix or upgrade. So, I’m looking for suggestions for a VoIP service that can actually handle the following:

1.	Call Queue Feature: Apparently, handling overflow calls during busy times is too futuristic for our current provider. We need a queue system that works without relying on smoke signals.

2.	Mobile App: An iPhone app that lets us answer and transfer calls on the go without needing a degree in rocket science to set up.

3.	IVR Maintenance: Something where I can update greetings for holidays or change call routing without summoning the IT gods.

4.	Support That Doesn’t Ghost: Fast responses via chat or email—because waiting 24+ hours for a reply is not customer service, it’s torture.

We’re in the USA if that matters for anything other than billing. Does anyone use a VoIP service that doesn’t make you want to pull your hair out? Let me know—bonus points if the setup doesn’t require an IT team!

Edit: we have 6 employees

> Okay. I get that what you're saying is The Way It Is; I've had a worm's-eye-view of the process of reactivating and then transferring a 'dead' telco number myself. But one of the nice things about being a fiction writer is that you get to re-write the rules occasionally. So, here's my Final Answer:

* Late February: The telco places a cell tower in service which is supposed to extend coverage for this rural area. They send techs out to verify signal strength, and then to notify customers that wired POTS is being discontinued as of March 31st and "such a deal I have for you!" on wireless voice and Internet.
* The telco's current terms of service require one full month's notification for cancellation by the service provider. But due to inclement winter weather, the techs are a couple days late showing up to the last customer site (my characters' sawmill) and don't deliver the notice until March 3rd.
* My characters pay the March bill on time and in full for service through the end of April.
* The discontinuance of POTS is not just because they're tired of servicing those few rural holdouts, it's because they have a failed switch in a major metro area and customers there are screaming. This switch out in the boonies is the most eligible to be repurposed. So they cut the power and the wires and truck it out of there on its way to Charlotte on April the 15th.
* Since my characters were not given required notice under the ToS and since the bill is paid, the number is not canceled right away. They're able to port their number over before it's officially canceled after the required month's notice.

Yes, I know that I'm overthinking this, but I like to respect my subject matter and my audience, even (especially!) teens/kids. So for those with experience in the field, I know it's a stretch...but if I can get my audience to accept a telekinetic teenager on the run from a psychic Deep State operative while a shapeshifting billionairess plots designs on them both...a screwed up telco shouldn't be too much to swallow...!

Heck of a good business model you’ve got there. 

The good news is the entire system is stacked against  making what you want to do work and with the new rules waiting to take effect will make things much harder and much more expensive for you to interrupt peoples lives.    Even if you fix this issue you’ve got a lot more versions of these kinds of problems in your future.

> # Looking for best home VOIP service with an ethernet phone that I won't lose control of my phone number.

I am hoping for some help and guidance. I still have a landline number that I, from a career in the wireless industry, know is my property via number portability and I want to keep this number. For years I have had my number at Vonage and am getting sick of the $35/month bill for a number that is basically parked and forwarded to my cellphone number.

That said, there are some changes in my home setup now as I have been working from home for the last 4 years and my work desk phone is here on my desk for conference calls and other calls I make via ethernet to my internet connection (Verizon Fios). My company has used Nextiva, but is sick of paying the bill and is ditching the desk phones and going all computer MS Teams for communications/calls.

What I am looking for is to have a business-feature/style phone on my desk with my landline number. I would like to use the VoIP ethernet connection I have set up. I researched this a couple of years ago and liked the SNOM phones (like the D735). I would like to get to a cheaper VoIP service where they can't steal my phone number from me (I have heard that Nextiva and Google Voice have done this to people). I don't need fancy features for VoIP service, just unlimited (or a high minute number) minutes, ability to forward to my cellphone when I don't answer my desk phone, and VM I guess. Open to VoIP provider and phone maker suggestions. Thanks!

This may answer a lot of interconnect questions. If you’re trying to get low level. If you want to be a CLEC, you need to connect your phone switch (could be soft phone switch(sip))to a tandem phone switching network. On top of that you will also require a connection for e911 services in the area your providing service and routing to them. 

Then also all the billing and legal items everyone talks about.

| 911 emergency dialing is available with FreePhoneLine.   You must be a certified user for 911 service to be active. A certified user means Freephoneline is able to verify that all registration information is correct. Your 911 call may be routed to a different dispatcher than that used for traditional 911 dialing. The dispatcher will be located at either the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or will be a local emergency service personnel designated for the address you listed at the time you subscribed for the Service.   The Service’s 911 service will not function if the Gateway fails or is not configured correctly or if your Service is not functioning for any reason, including, but not limited to, in the event of a power outage, broadband service outage, or suspension or disconnection of your Service because of billing issues. If there is a power outage, you may be required to reset or reconfigure the Gateway prior to being able to use the Service, including for 911 purposes.   911 dialing will not function correctly if you move your Gateway to a location other than that provided to FreePhoneLine.ca at the time you activated the Service. In such event, in order to have 911 calling routed correctly, you must update your service address at www.freephoneline.ca.   The PSAP or local emergency service dispatcher receiving your 911 call through the Service may not be able to capture and/or retain automatic number of location information. This means that the dispatcher may not know the phone number or physical location of the person who is making the 911 call. Therefore, if you dial 911 using the Service, you must immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency, if different). You must ensure not to disconnect the line, as the dispatcher may not have a phone number to use to call you back. You must not hang up until you are told to do so by the dispatcher. If you are inadvertently disconnected you must call back immediately. If you are unable to speak and describe your location, the emergency dispatcher may not be able to locate you. If you dial 911 and hang up the receiver, your call will be disconnected.   For technical reasons associated with the possibility of network congestion, with the Service, there is a possibility that your 911 call will produce a busy signal or will take longer to answer, as compared to traditional 911 calls.

>Since we provide phone service to you, we’re legally required to provide access to 911 emergency services, which we incur costs for. Unfortunately we cannot remove 911 service from your account/service. If we did not charge a fee, we would likely have to shut FreePhoneLine service down all together as it does not make sense for us to absorb increasing fees to provide free services.

>We recognize that adjustments to your bill may not be ideal, but there is no contract that states you will receive free-to-use phone service indefinitely. The service is subject to change and there is no penalty for cancelling service. We have provided more than 60 days notice for you to make other arrangements should you disagree with this change.

The costs of this third party’s services have risen to unforeseen levels due to the rapid inflation we have had in recent years. It's no longer financially viable to provide free 911 service.

### r/VOIP — 2024-07-18 | 2pts | `positive`

> To address your first part, theyre all on the same switch. The way our network is set up is we have every CAT5 cable coming down a pipe in the cieling that goes into a patch panel on our track, then from the patch panel into two Netgear switches (oddly, all phones just happen to be on our top netgear switch, just somehow worked out that way to use the PoE function), then from the switches, it goes into a Ubiquiti Edge Router X, then to our Fiber ONT (which is in bridge mode so I can control the network better via the Edge Router X). So ill poke around in the Edge router to see if there is any multicasting configuratings I can set up to get that working. Looking around on the further with the VOIP Server we are using, they do not seem to have anything on their end for that and their tech support DID tell us - its something where the phones need to be configured for that - not the server side. So it would have the be the latter to take a look into.

  
For the second part of your comment, same answer from the VOIP service - it has to be set up via the phones, not the server side. The DND function IS native to the phone. The 3rd menu function button on all phones is "DND".  Now, how you explained it on the server side of things - this is exactly what I figured what was going on. I put my phone in DND, and no other phone sees it, my thought was "Well, the server isnt TELLING the other phones "That person is in DND right now" because...it doesnt know. Its not sending that information of DND from the phone, to the server, then back to our location to tell the other 3 phones. But this is where I get confused because it DOES WORK as far as being on calls or being free. The server is clearly telling the other 3 phones, that 1 phone is currently on the line with someone. So why DND won't work? Puzzling me - which prompted me to come here to ask "What on earth is going on!?" LOL 

Now, I did leave something out in my OP that I felt wasn't necessary, but maybe itll help work out in the end. We recently switched ISPs. We were using Comcast for years with traditional cable internet/phone and we wanted fiber. Not to digress too much here but Comcast was our only option here in our industrial complex because the landlords son apparently had some relationship to comcast and wouldnt allow another ISP? IDK, even the landlord was like "um what? Im not aware of that" but who knows, thats what this NEW ISP told us which is a Fiber ISP (Bluestream Fiber, I use them for residential and theyre amazing and their tech support is great I can nerd out to shit with them). Enough digressing, this is what prompted us to move our phone systems to this. Our final set up appointment is tomorrow. We did decline to use one of their phones they would lease to use which was Polyfon? (probably spelt that wrong), we wanted more options and they said any VOIP phone works and it saves money on the bill if you just buy your own. Ill be honest, these Fanvils are AWESOME in my opinion.

> I recently had to do the same thing. There was some confusion about who the resporg actually was. We were paying a bill to AT&T that we thought was for 800 service. AT&T even told us as much. Turns out the resporg was still an old after hours call center we hadn't used in over 2 years. The bill from AT&T was in error, and the old call center had unknowingly been eating the charge for 2 years. Once we figured that out, the process was fairly easy.

Short answer: Find out who the resporg is. That entity and your new carrier need to work together to complete the port.

> VoIP can easily accomplish this. We do it all the time using SIP Trunking (Telnyx, Twilio, VoIP Innovations, etc) and a server running FreePBX. SIP Trunking is where a provider sells a service to connect a computer/server PBX to telephone lines. There are many providers for SIP Trunking and many different hosted PBX platforms, but we find FreePBX to be simple and many features. A PBX is a computer/server/appliance that operates a physical phone system and contains all your programming, to make your extensions/apps/phones connect and pass that on to the SIP Trunking provider. Then we add a mobile app called SangomaTalk (aka Sangoma Connect). There are many softphone/mobile apps that you can use also (Linphone comes to mind if you want a free one or your provider doesn’t have a branded app), but we have found the ease of setup, security, and call quality on SangomaTalk to be superior to others in our testing on our equipment. 

The USA companies I mentioned above also operate internationally and with international numbers, but someone can maybe point you to a German provider than can do the same for a better rate and better matching your needs/taxes/etc. 

However, what you are asking for is extremely simple and should be available in any Cloud PBX offering. A cloud PBX is often sold with the SIP Trunking and PBX together as a single purchase. Everything is in the cloud, so you don’t buy any equipment. And it is priced per extension. 

You need:

1 phone number (often called a DID)
1 inbound route (programs what happens on PBX when DID called - points to ring group)
1 ring group (can ring all extensions simultaneously, sequentially, etc)
3 extensions (this is usually what you pay for when you setup this kind of service $/mo/ext)

Then decide what happens to unanswered calls. This is setup in the ring group. I assume they go to a single voicemail if all 3 extensions miss the call. But the unanswered call could also go to an automated attendant (press 1, 2, 3 system) and then go to multiple voicemails or different places based on the digit pressed by the caller. 

Outbound calls for each extension will just be setup to show your main number. This is called CNAM (caller name and number). Some providers refer to this as caller id masking but that is really an improper use of that term with VoIP and more refers to when people have multiple copper telephone lines. 
3 extensions (and, 3 mobile apps free or licensed)

If the app is proprietary then they will just send you a link to click on and setup is usually automatic. If you use a free app, then you’ll have a server address, username, and password to enter in the app. 

When you receive a call it will ring in the mobile app (this is a SIP client that works just like a desk phone). You would have options like answering calls, transferring between extensions, hold, conference, transfer to outside number, recording, etc. When you place an outbound call you just use the app and people will see your busines

> This is each user has 10 seconds to answer or it dumps out to an external number, and then business hours / holiday hours layered on top of that? You'll probably have to create Call Queues of 1 for each in your platform of choice, and when it doesn't get answered it fails over. 



I'm not sure what ownership you have of a client's phone system, but in a perfect world you could build it all in your own account and bill them back for services? Utilize templates to create users, have troubleshooting visibility, etc.

> April 2024:  
I agree with most of your assessment. Even during the business hours the person answering the chat works for some BPO. Even calling their advertised support number and trying to get a certain department you will most likely be answered by tier 1 support who doesn't actually work in that department (E.g. selecting LNP option and still getting the same person who couldn't help during a chat session).

Their first line of support will chat will with their internal team and then just read back what the internal team wrote, clearly not understanding what they're actually saying. I guess it's better than nothing, but still not great. Any time I need to actually get something done I just automatically call my account rep to get it escalated. Urgency doesn't seem to register with support chat. They will just say some canned response like "the team is working on it."

I used to have thousands of numbers with them, but switched to another carrier a couple of years ago. Mostly used Telnyx for a few services and a backup for outbound. Too many call quality issues that would constantly need route updates. When you're managing thousands of end users, you really don't have time to constantly supply call samples  only for them to wait past 72 hours and then have them ask for another one. I moved to another carrier and have had almost zero issues with call quality since (at least as far as carrier related issues!). Makes life a lot easier not getting inundated with tickets from customers to then have to troubleshoot at the local network level with another IT company and then to go to Telnyx for support and ask them to fix. 

I want to be fair to Telnyx and say they do have some useful features. Debugging/Call reports work well mostly. Access to invoices is easy. Setting up different SIP trunks and outbound profiles is simple. 

The biggest issues I had with Telnyx:  
-Numbers were given to another Telnyx without any notification. Months went by until the customer brought to my attention that one of their spare numbers didn't work. It was active in my account and was being charged the whole time. Support couldn't explain why it was in 2 different customer accounts and wouldn't give it back. This was part of a customers block of 100 DID's that they ported in a couple years before that. Customer didn't put p much of a fight so I gave up trying to get a resolution.   
-Numbers were ported away without notification for months while still being charged and marked as "active" in my account.  
-Needed to work out billing issues in which Telnyx had to refund thousands of dollars for. We had to bring this to their attention and their response time isn't very good.   
-Too many call quality issues. Switching our traffic to another carrier was the only real resolution for us. It wasn't the ISP, it wasn't the LAN. Too many of the same symptoms across too many customers. All resolved by switching carriers.

I suppose it's normal for a company to have tickets get

> As others have noted, short duration call penalties are for *outgoing* calls, as a way to either deter or better monetize cold callers, scammers, etc. who tend to get hung up on a lot.

It should not be coming up in the context of incoming calls unless you're immediately forwarding those calls out somewhere else making them count as both.

If that's what's happening, like you're immediately forwarding to an answering service where the caller then hangs up, stop doing that and land it first on an IVR or something that can provide the basic details and then only forwards out if the caller selects to speak to a human.

If you really aren't doing anything like that then I'd suggest checking your call records to ensure you aren't dealing with a compromised system where someone else is using it to scam people.

If neither of those are the case and it really is just inbound calling then I'd take it to a billing rep and consider changing carriers if they can't help.

> Which paid service is the most like the free version of Google Voice?

I migrated off the free version and do not like the paid version of GV at all.  This is for small/remote home offices with 4 users at the moment

Features I came to depend on:

1. Web (and mobile) interface easily showing all calls and texts back to the beginning
2. Simultaneous ring to mobile and desk phones so calls get answered when nobody is at the office
3. Easy transferring among desk phones
4. Good SMS inbound and outbound
5. Voicemail transcription
6. Easy to call outbound from mobile phone anywhere

It looks like [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) might fit the bill but possibly somewhat clunky interface, hard to tell.  Unifi looks interesting, but do they do mobile?  Ooma for business looks interesting but have a poor reputation from what I can tell.

> **Moving from RingCentral and looking for an alternative.**  


The issue with RingCentral isn't really the cost but the reliability. A lot of calls are missed where the app never rings on desktop or mobile. Mobile app is always logging us out etc.

Have a small team of 5 and currently have a business Phone solution with RC. We have 3 numbers. We're going to start utilizing a reception service that we pay for as part of our virtual office.

Ideally we would forward our main number calls to the receptionist service so when someone calls main number, the receptionist will answer. Example - caller would say they want to get on to billing and the receptionist would forward that call to one of the other numbers where, whoever on the team is assigned to that number on the system will receive the phone call on the VOIP system.

Would like to be able to configure it in such a way that in the event that person does not answer, we can set a voicemail or even forward the call to another number.

We don't make a lot of outgoing calls but in the event that the person in billing makes a call from the number they are assigned to, can the voip solution mask that number so it looks like the call is coming from the main number?

Last requirement would need to be mobile apps.

Located in Canada if that makes a difference.

> Short answer: VOIP is not the best tool for the job. 

Long answer:   
  
Don't overcomplicate what you're trying to do. The first, and easiest ask would be "do they(the university, presumably) have any form of call forwarding for your analog line?" Chances are they do, and you'd just have to enable that-because this is all it sounds like you're trying to do. Now, whether they'll allow this is a separate story. It's also possible, even likely, that whatever phone system they're using to provide service has an app you can install on your phone. If that's the case, there would almost always be some setup you'd have to do.

It is 99% likely that your phone line is VOIP, in that it travels over computer networks, but by the time it gets to your dorm is turned back into analog signal. This means that someone at university who runs the phone systems almost certainly has the ability to do this-whether they have the inclination(or permission) is a whole different story. 

As for adding your phone line to Unifi Talk, that's basically a no. Unifi, like any provider, can only provide service to numbers they own, and it's exceedingly unlikely you'll be able to tell the university to transfer your number to them. You can initiate a transfer of ownership from a number you pay for and manage, but I get the impression you're not receiving a bill for this in your name. 

  
Your first step should be to reach out to the IT department at your university. They likely have some sort of intranet and may already have the instructions on enabling phone features somewhere in the help section.

> >Does this mean we're never, ever able to recommend businesses or alternatives when posters ask questions? 

You are 100% allowed to recommend businesses when replying to requests in the monthly requests thread.

Otherwise if someone asks "How do I do X with provider Y?" and you respond with "You should use provider Z instead", you are breaking the rules.

If someone is looking for help solving a specific problem, it is never acceptable to recommend alternatives. It **is** however perfectly fine to say "this is a problem inherent to Service XYZ. The only solution is to change providers." This answers the question without promoting any particular competitor.

&#x200B;

>the way you are thinking of doing this is way overkill, I would recommend going with \[insert name of commonly used Voip service\] for this 

Is the "overkill" solution *the only way to do it* within the OP's ecosystem? If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say "Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider. If you want a different solution you will have to find a new business to work with."

&#x200B;

> So we're never allowed to mention names of Voip services, SIP apps, number parking services, etc. etc. outside of the quarantined threads? Is that what I'm reading? 

No. Discussions of business, services and products is not only allowed, but encouraged. The only stipulation is that it must be *on topic* and not promotional.

For example:

Someone asks "Which of these three PBXs can be integrated with Provider XYZ?"

Here is a good reply:

"XYZ Telecom, VoIP Provider W, and ABC123 all work. I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\_to\_website or you will have a bad time."

Here is a bad reply:

"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support"

One of them answers the question ("Which can be integrated?") while also giving helpful insight ("some settings misbehave"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.

If on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment" is fine, because the API requiring PHP

> wow this got hot! To be clear i’m not complaining about their actual product or pricing! I’m very satisfied there and with their API! It works for what I do, it is reliable, and the pricing fits what I need well. Doesn’t have to be the cheapest but to be clear CEO it’s a good set of products! I’m very satisfied there! 

I just wish it felt more like a partnership then calling Comcast! 

I’m not sure I want to divulge the details of my individual tickets, either here or in DM…. I don’t want to be wake up and see my account cut and be left high and dry overnight! This got a lot hotter then intended. I’m not prepared with any backup! I am totally reliant on Telnyx for my entire business core offerings. 

But I’m really glad it got your attention! I like to hear that there have been a round of investments in support, that’s a positive response! But seriously it’s lacking so so much, it hurts my heart because I like the product so much for what I do! It’s great! But man are the simplest questions so hard to get direct answers to! Like a recent inquiry just for something like “Hey what’s the billing rate for this service?” Over a week, first ticket just died with zero response… and i feel like it took near harassment by me to get the answer! But like wow, imho it’s the most simple of questions! I do have most tickets unresolved and they have just died. That seems to be extremely common with my tickets. I really like the companies that harass me about open tickets! lol I think everyone in tech knows those companies… 

CEO - Why not offer a premium support option? Like in tiers? Kinda like AWS does? What I experience is fine for some free level perhaps, but when shit hits the fan I wanna get a hold of someone asap to work with me to resolve the issue on one call! And I want quick escalations, (like after 20 minutes with tier 1). If you already do offer this, please make it dead simple to sign up online and subscribe to one a monthly billing basis! I don’t wanna talk to sales! lol… I’d pay $50-$100 a month for support one step up where someone personally gets assigned my ticket and works it and follows up daily until resolved. And not those automated updates that are like “Hey we’re working on your issue”… IMHO that response is trash and just pisses me off! They don’t count as a response to me at all, they just irritate me and remind me I have an open ticket that will probably never ever get human eyes on it again. 

My opinion and recommendation would be to focus and track one call close metrics, and work on that metric a lot! Then there would be no follow up issues, but why not do LIVE escalations on the tickets? Try hard for that one call close please! i realize that’s isn’t always possible but damn I’ve asked some dead simple questions, that result in let me get back to you, and then it dies. Your beat chance for “great” service is one call close imo! 

I think i’ll just enter all my future tickets as P1’s and see if that helps! Although support will

> This is your answer.   I work for a VoIP company and several clients want to go as cheap as possible.  They buy the phone outright and only pay for monthly service and do not pay for support or the phone lease cost.  The least expensive I have seen this cost (including all VoIP companies I know) is about $18 a month.  The company I work for charges $25 (you cannot remove support but then we offer to manage your phonebook as well).  So you'll have to ask around.

Just remember that they provide instructions usually only once to get you online.  If you have any issues after install, they bill per (half) hour for support.  With my company, we usually recommend at least a Yealink T46S (as the T26P or T28P are now too EOL).  You can find these on Amazon for $95-$105 and power supply for $10-$18 (you need the 5V 2A one).

**Staff utilization**

We don't bill by the hour and don't calculate utilization to capacity. But I get your point...how do we ensure we give folks enough work but not too much? It's a dance and unscientific at best. It comes down to supervisors paying attention and adjusting as needed or negotiating with the project manager for time. It gets harder with scale because the problem is bigger.

> First of all thanks for commenting and to the other person on this comment chain what you already discussed with eachother has been helpful.

I think you answered most of my question even though I didn't express myself clearly. Let me clarify:

There's 2 things I want to know:

- How in general consultants tackle multiple clients and is my situation unqiue or are there other approaches (i.e you secure contract work that is billed per devliberable/project instead of daily rates comes to my mind.. as then you can just focus on the deliverable instead of billable hours and you don't need to worry how you juggle things as long as the work is done or what you suggested.. tracking 20 hours or however much your worked and saying you're unavailable the rest of the day etc. if you have work with another client or some 3rd approach which i dont know about etc.)

I'm asking this quesiton because either I'm doing something wrong or I have unrealistic expecations for what actually is consultant work, so I needed more clarity on that. If my situation is pretty standard and most clients need you to be dedicated the typical 40hours per week and you're billed per hours worked on their project then consultancy is probably not for me as I'd rather get the benefits of being a fulltime employee. For me the idea of consultancy is to be able to offer a service and have multiple clients (as long as you can deliver to all of them) and not be billed on hours worked but rather on results and deliverables, in fact you should be rewarded if you can deliver something faster with the same quality.

- The second question is regarding my specific scenario which to be honest is also not fully clear to me... I haven't actually started work on the project. On the one side we're talking about a project that is say 9months long fixed-term with a target deliverable, on the other side they want me to track billable hours and pay me on that. 

I'm sorry but if I'm ready with all deliverables at the 3 month mark, why would i deliver it then if im being payed by the hour? Wether I stretch my work hours to be longer to collect a full pay check, or just be a perfectionist so everything takes me twice as long, there is no incentive to actually complete the work as fast as possible.This is why I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. 

What you said if I do have a second client is what I'll do - be upfront about it with the first hour and tell them I won't be available for meetings with them if I'm already busy and in meetings with the second client OR if they're really expecting me to be 8hours dedicated all day to them I'll simply decline any adittional clients as I wouldn't have the capacity for both and I'll probably look for another altenrative path in the future.. either billing per project or something else.

My intention is not to short any client, that's the whole point of the post, if I wanted to do that I wouldn't be asking for permission or discussing it online, it's more so to unde

> If you have to ask these rather fundamental questions that any of the current (even free) chat bots could answer then I don’t think you are ready to start that firm. 

But just to be a little bit of a dick. I went ahead and asked ChatGPT for you. Consider yourself consulted:


To launch a successful AI consulting firm, here’s a structured approach addressing your questions:

1. Choose High-Ticket AI Consulting Services

	•	AI Strategy Development: Guide clients in understanding and adopting AI to transform their operations. This service often commands premium rates as it targets C-level executives.
	•	Custom AI Solutions: Build end-to-end AI systems tailored to specific client needs, like predictive modeling, automation, and optimization. Tailored solutions have higher value as they address unique client pain points.
	•	Data Science and Analytics: Offer advanced analytics, including predictive analysis, anomaly detection, and customer insights.
	•	ML and AI Training: Upskill client teams to leverage in-house AI capabilities. This can lead to long-term, high-ticket retainers.
	•	AI Implementation and Maintenance: Ongoing support and monitoring ensure client systems stay optimized, allowing for recurring revenue.

2. How to Get Clients

	•	Networking: Attend industry events, conferences, and online meetups to connect with potential clients. Partner with firms that offer complementary services.
	•	Thought Leadership: Publish insights, whitepapers, and case studies to build credibility. Contribute to AI publications, LinkedIn, and industry blogs.
	•	Referrals and Partnerships: Build relationships with other firms, especially in tech and consulting. Often, larger firms outsource specialized AI work.
	•	Cold Outreach: Identify target clients (mid-to-large firms in sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail) and reach out through email or LinkedIn with personalized value propositions.

3. Billing Structure

	•	Hourly Billing: Common for open-ended projects. Rates for specialized AI consulting can range from $150 to $400+ per hour, depending on the complexity.
	•	Project-Based Billing: Define a project scope and set a fixed price. This model works well for defined deliverables, offering predictability for both you and the client.
	•	Retainer Model: Charge a recurring monthly fee for ongoing support and maintenance. Retainers build long-term client relationships and ensure stable cash flow.
	•	Value-Based Pricing: For high-impact projects, bill based on the estimated value you’re delivering. This can significantly increase profitability but requires experience in scoping client ROI.

4. Compensation for Employees

	•	Base Salary: For skilled AI talent, average annual salaries range from $120k to $200k+ for experienced engineers.
	•	Equity Options: Especially in early stages, offering 0.5–2% equity can attract top talent and foster long-term commitment. It’s also a cost-effective way to compete with larger firms on compensation.
	•	Bonuses: Offer perform

According to USASpending.gov, CGI Federal got a total of $678 million for various services under the contract — including the $93.7 million Healthcare.gov job, which CGI Federal won over three other companies in late 2011.
It’s also true that CGI Federal began lobbying as it started winning government work. According to OpenSecrets.org, it has spent $800,000 since 2006 lobbying on several different tax and appropriations bills. That’s nothing, though, compared to the many millions of dollars deployed by heavy hitters like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.*

Can’t be an IT contractor without doing a little bit of lobbying. (OpenSecrets)
What exactly were they responsible for?

According to a June report from the Government Accountability Office, a total of 55 contractors were retained to work on the rollout of the federal health-care marketplace. CGI Federal was the primary one, and had received $88 million out of the $394 million that had been spent at that point (the next biggest recipient got $55 million). Along with building sites for the states that elected to participate in the federal marketplace, it’s in charge of knitting all the pieces together, making Quality Software Services’ data hub work seamlessly with Development Seed’s sleek user interface and Oracle’s identity management software — or “designing an IT solution that is adaptable and modular to accommodate the implementation of additional functional requirements and services,” as CGI Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell put it in a September hearing on the progress of the site.

What exactly went wrong?
That is a matter of some disagreement. And the answer isn’t necessarily that CGI is wholly responsible.

Some people think that the system was underfunded: Donald Berwick, who administered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011, says the site failed because they didn’t have enough money to build it from the start. Others point fingers at the Department of Health and Human Services, which took years to issue final specifications, preventing CGI from really getting started until this spring.
Either way, it’s clear that the site itself isn’t well constructed: IT professionals told the Wall Street Journal that in addition to specific pieces not working, the whole thing was “built on a sloppy software foundation,” potentially due to the haste with whi

> Lots of good perspective has already been added on how you should SELL your work moving forward.
But to answer your question, you should have already agreed upon a model with this client if you term used is ‘billing’ instead of ‘quoting’.
When it’s an hourly rate, I charge my clients the same if it’s prepping for a workshop, leading the workshop, doing technical work or reading through a thread of 10 emails I was forwarded for context.
Other projects it’s for an agree total cost for x services. The ‘risk’ is mine if it takes me longer due to complexity, but so is the upside if I’m really efficient.

> I'd like to offer you some contrarian advice. I've noticed that many people have discouraged you from pursuing your idea. Here's my recommendation: take every single reason you were given for why it  wouldn't work and find solid answers for each one.

For instance, someone says you don't have a niche, then find one. If someone mentions your lack of experience, know  that if you can master a concept well enough to offer value to a business, they'll pay for it...bottom line...The means to the end don't matter as much as the end itself...especially in this internent age where one can quickly master a topic..at least compared to decades ago... I could go on and on, but you get my point. Regardless of the idea you pursue, someone will tell you it won't work. So, instead of moving on to the next thing, find answers to each of those points and keep moving forward.

That being said, if you can't find satisfactory answers or workarounds to why something won't work, especially when it comes from smart people, and I see many of them responded to you, then maybe your idea needs A LOT of refinement and you need to go back to the drawing board. But, as I mentioned, expect to keep hearing "it won't work." I'm sure Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs all received thier fair share of "it wont work", but they persevered, adapted, and found solutions to the challenges they faced.

Now if  you do decide to pursue your consulting idea and develop a valuable service or product, you might want to explore this platform that connects [small businessess](https://consultantvue.co/small-business-consulting/) with  independent consultants. Small businesses with tight budgets are more likely to support your idea provided you do develop a valuable product or service....thats my long take.... Good luck!

> Man all terrible answers from people who don’t know how to Project Manage well.

If you are leading 10 people across many projects (just like me) you know that you need to understand workload capacity and plan and have things like estimated vs actual time, prioritization, statuses, assigned users, etc and you need it all to flow to billing.  Monday is a little too lightweight. You need more of a PSA (professional services automation) tool vs a lightweight “project management” tool. 

Check g2crowd for PSA tools, and look at leaders in PM tools.  We use Teamwork which is not perfect but works well.

### r/consulting — 2023-04-02 | 19pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> I can answer this from the perspective of "why I don't run my own consultancy anymore:"

1) The acquisition - delivery paradox: You have to have clients to earn money, and that means dedicating your time and effort to deliver the best service to each client. At the same time, you have to invest time and effort in acquisition, because client contracts eventually end. But maybe the client want to keep you around and has another project for you ... now you have to somehow clone yourself, because you have two clients demanding your time. Or, you bet that the client will extend your contract, and he doesn't, so you're suddenly left with no client, no project and no income until you can acquire the next one. 

2) The middlemen - It's almost impossible for a small consultancy to get a direct contract with a corporation. Most medium-sized and almost all large companies have a "preferred provider" list of suppliers, and are very unwilling to onboard additional suppliers, especially small consultancies. So you end up having to sub-contract under one of the existing suppliers (usually one of the big consultancies or a recruiting agency). That costs you between 15% and 25% off the top. I did this for 5 years (I was a partner in a boutique), and the other company was earning €300 per day for the work I was delivering - €1,500 per week, 46 weeks per year = €69,000 per year for writing an occasional SoW to the client and issuing an invoice every month. (And they managed to fuck those up massively, even though I had recorded my working hours every day in their own SAP CATS time tracking system). 

3) The payment delay - Most clients will try to push out the invoice payments as long as possible. You can ask for net 30, but they'll try to get you to accept net 90. Even if you do manage to get agreement for net 45, it's usually between 60 and 90 days before the money hits your bank account. So, if you do work in April, you issue the invoice on May 2nd, and if you're lucky, you'll have the money in July, but in reality, it'll probably be early August. I used to work for a client who paid its bills after 120 days - their attitude was, "if you don't like it, too bad. If you don't want to wait for your money, then go find another client, because we've got a dozen other consultancies waiting to go to work for us."

&#x200B;

Today, I am in an industry management position - and I understand the situation a bit better. We also have "qualified suppliers" and it's a major pain-in-the-ass to get a new supplier on-boarded. It takes about 4 to 8 weeks for a supplier to be qualified by the sourcing department, then they have to issue a change ticket to get the new supplier added to the ERP system (master data changes are executed by the IT department). The qualification process includes a long questionnaire, credit checks, and (for some critical parts) an on-site vendor audit before the supplier can be qualified. If you aren't certified (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001, etc.), t

> As replied above, the solution should be similar to calling a receptionist and being forwarded to the various departments only that billing is involved. Both the inmates and penpals are registered on the website. Penpals are given a 5-digit code connected to accounts (and therefore their mobile phones).  Inmates call our central number, input the 5-digit code and are forwarded to the person on the other end and are billed per minute (they can load their accounts using various means like stripe).

> This is a trivial setup. One that is easy done with [voip.ms](https://voip.ms)

The cost of voip.ms is incredibly low, and configurability is awesome. There's a reason they are dominant in this field. They charge per use/per minute, but at a rate of like 0.005$ - 0.009$ per minute (half a penny to a penny per minute). There is no "per-extension" cost. It's all shared minutes. So very cost effective. There is no monthly fee, it's just whatever you pre-pay.

The only downside to [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) that it's a self-service system, and customer service is only available through chat -- but they are very knowledgeable and helpful and once you get going, it's not hard at all to understand how things work.

&#x200B;

Below is from what I recall and there are likely subtleties, but overall each of these steps is pretty straightforward to do on the web portal.

If you have problems, you can simply ask the online customer service rep to help you out. If you really need additional technical help, I can probably help (DM me). I can probably get you up and running within 2 hours or so (max 3).

&#x200B;

**Step 1 - Register** a voip.ms account. Note your 6-digit account #, ex: "345678".

&#x200B;

**Step 2 - Finances -> Add funds** to the account (eg: 15$ to start).

&#x200B;

**Step 3 - Transfer your existing office phone number to** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms)**.** (if this will be a new number aka new office, skip this step).  You will have to take a picture of your current carrier's invoice showing your name, address, account number, and phone number, to identify you;  on the same page write, by hand, "please port this number to voip.ms" and then sign. It will take about 10 days for the request to complete.  **Go to DID Numbers -> DID Portability** and follow instructions.

&#x200B;

**Step 4: DID Numbers -> Order DID(s) :** Register 1 new DID (aka: phone number). This will be a temporary number you will use to set up your office while your previous number is being ported over (or this new DID will become your actual number if you didn't have one before).

&#x200B;

**Step 5:  Sub-Accounts -> Create Sub Account.**  Create 5 sub-accounts (1 sub account per co-worker).  These will look like: "345678\_JIM", "345678\_BOB", etc.  When you create these subaccounts.  Assign voice mail number 101 through 105. By default (which is what you want) each sub-account will be assigned the DID you got in step 4, so all outgoing calls made by all co-workers via VOIP will look like they are coming from your office number.

&#x200B;

**Step 6 (optional, but nice): DID Numbers -> Ring Groups -> Create new ring group.** Name this ring group "everyone" -- and in the ring group, select the 5 sub-accounts you just created. This feature will allow everyone to receive a ring if a caller selects an option to speak to  "the first available lawyer". Everybody's phone will ring, the first one to pick up wins the call.

&#x200B;

**Step 7: Record an auto-answer message**. On

We use [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) to answer calls when I can't get to them and they're pretty good but I do a better job of booking paid consultations because I know the business better. One of the attorneys I work with hired a remote legal secretary before me and fired her because she kept spelling people's names wrong and lost a couple of potential clients over it. If your practice is easy, a remote paralegal could work but if you need someone with excellent customer services skills and/or you want them to take credit cards, I recommend someone who is US based. While I charge significantly more an hour than a remote person, I also bring in more than my client pays me. I'm a source of revenue, not just an expense.

2. You use a call answering service

Obviously, if you're a solo attorney, you're not building the call center in-house because it's expensive, cumbersome, and takes a long time.

Highly recommend using an answering service that works specifically with law firms and understands intake. The one I use is called InsideOut Law Calls.

> Your approach is 100% the right move for a new PI firm. No one comes out of the gate outranking the massive PI mills for terms like “car accident lawyer.” The smart play is to target long-tail and hyper-local keywords early.

I’d run keyword research through Ahrefs and look for low KD (Keyword Difficulty) phrases like: “motorcycle accident lawyer in {your suburb}, “injured in a Lyft/Uber crash in {city}, “pedestrian accident attorney near {neighborhood}”

These long-tails usually convert better anyway because the search intent is super specific. As your site builds authority, this strategy basically spring-loads your SEO, meaning you’ll jump faster into higher-value keywords later.

While you build those pages, keep stacking the long-game SEO pieces:  
strong location pages  
individual practice-area pages (car, truck, rideshare, wrongful death, etc.)  
FAQ content based on real client questions  
case result pages as you build them (even co-counsel work if allowed)

One huge piece people overlook is Google Business Profile (GBP). For PI, it’s often your #1 lead channel before your website matures. A few things I recommend:

optimize it fully, categories, services, photos, hours, description  
post weekly updates (Google actually rewards activity)  
ask every satisfied client for a review starting day one  
make sure reviewers mention city + type of case naturally (“helped me after my Summerlin rear-end wreck”), that boosts local ranking  
add Q&As and answer them yourself so prospects see helpful info right away

A strong GBP with consistent reviews can put you in the local map pack faster than your website will rank.

(PS: You’ll often start getting calls from GBP surprisingly fast because Google prioritizes “near me” searches based on proximity.)

On the ads side: PI PPC is brutally expensive, but tightly scoped local campaigns can work once your intake systems are dialed in. If calls aren’t being answered live, don’t run ads yet, you’ll burn cash.

And yes, you can absolutely “spring-load” your website for launch. Have your developer prep all pages, URL structure, schema, internal linking, and content ahead of time. When the site goes live, Google sees a complete, optimized structure instead of a bare-bones site, which usually gives a stronger early indexing/ranking boost.

You’re thinking about this more strategically than most solos who open a PI shop, with your experience + financial runway + a solid SEO/GBP plan, you’re in a better position than you probably think.

> Exactly! This is such a real issue — most attorneys I know (including myself) end up spending half the consultation just gathering basic intake details, and only the other half giving actual legal advice.

We struggled with this too. Tried a few answering services like Bellmore and others, but they were pretty expensive and mostly just acted as receptionists — no real understanding of what kind of information we actually needed from clients.

Eventually, we tried Arka AI — it’s more of a virtual assistant that focuses on deeper intake. They worked with us to customize the intake questions to match the ones I usually ask during a first call. They also gave a free two-month trial, so I figured it was worth a shot. It’s been working surprisingly well — I’d say it saves me around 40% of my consultation time now, which makes a big difference since I usually have 2–3 calls a day.

> As you can tell by all the responses, there are lots of ways to do this. Smaller firms tend to keep this in house because it allows them to keep control. In bigger firms, this gets much harder because the staffing gets pretty tough.

The first question you need to answer is whether your current set up works. A paralegal doing the calls is expensive. He/she has other skills so they may be able to do other things that make more money.  You could then hire a dedicated intake person to handle the calls. The cost differential would be small because your paralegal (theoretically) could be making you more money. But here’s the rub: you have to hire a great intake person. If the intake person sucks air, it will kill your firm. That’s why lots of firms outsource this. The intake person is a mix of legal knowledge, compassion and sales.  Good ones are invaluable. Bad ones are fatal to the firm. 

In my mind, the best next step would be to document your process with your current paralegal. Figure out what they do. How many calls a day?  How much time does it take per call?  What is the sign up rate (of the cases you want)?  No one is 100%. What are the cases you want? Don’t want?  You need a very very very detailed process so you can then go to market and find someone to do it.  That person could be an in house hire or from a service. Either way, you need to know the process in exquisite detail and be able to track the results. You can’t measure success any other way. 

Once you implement the new hire, you need milestones and metrics to measure success. This is a royal pain in the a$$ because it feels like babysitting. But you have to do it to be sure you’re not getting screwed by the new hire. If you don’t, you will be in 6 months and realize you have no cases coming in because your new person didn’t know he/she was doing it wrong (or was just bad at the job). 

As you can probably tell, I’ve done this. I own a firm and have lived this. Intake is a dark art but very important. Treat it that way and you will do well. Good luck and let us know what you did.

> As a new (~1 year) paralegal, who is 55 years old and has three other careers behind me, this is great advice. 

There are ABSOLUTELY some things about being a lawyer (or in the legal profession) that are different from "other" jobs, but the basics of honesty, career development, work-life balance, "good boss/bad boss", etc. are universal. 

1) "Work from home/hybrid/chained to a desk at the office" are UNIVERSAL questions in the workplace. Don't let anyone lie to you about their expectations. 

2) My SAs are amazing in their "support" of me, so I "support" them back with equal passion and zeal. So *together* we've managed to hit some impossible deadlines and sometimes triumph on behalf of our clients. They are as respectful of my abilities and limits as I am of theirs. I wouldn't work for someone (attorney or not) who didn't respect their need to support me. That is the "price" of loyalty. 

3) I have been handed a task and told "go." BUT, along with that, the guidance to figure the shit out, and the acknowledgment that my first draft wouldn't be perfect. The best part of my training is when my SAs answer my questions with "here is where you can look this up" instead of annoyance. It makes me smarter and more capable, and also reflects that THAT is what they want.

4) To quote:

> "I've only been litigating a year and have no idea what I'm doing. It's a whole new area of law for me."

As a newb to the legal field, the biggest shock for me was learning that my SAs (both of whom I consider to be among the smartest, most ethical, and kindest humans I have had the privilege to know)... don't think they know shit. 

They are ALWAYS looking things up, NEVER assuming they "know what they are doing." Both are litigators. Litigation is, by definition, NEVER the same thing twice in a row. My opinion on this matter is worth fuck-all, but you asked the question, so my answer is: if you don't love it being new where you don't know what you're doing, *but can do it with the right support and time and love*, don't litigate. But that is YOUR choice. I f'ing love the fact that my last career will be filled with learning new skills until I'm too mentally weak to learn more. Then I'll die happily. But, that's me. Your mileage may vary.

5) To quote, again:

> (cue panic attack today crying in my office)

I "retired" from being a professional chef to focus on being a paralegal. There's a well-known phrase in the restaurant industry about "crying in the walk-in" which means going into a big-ass refrigerator and closing the door before you let loose on those excess emotions. The reason it's a trope is that... well... e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e has done it, and instead of thinking overwhelming emotions are "toxic", the food service community accepts it is part of life.

It's 10X that in the legal community, but somehow some/most of y'all don't simply accept that. What you do as lawyers is passionate, HARD, taxing, challenging work. And YOU have to accept the responsibility for s

> These are great points. Marketing is testing. Testing the message and medium. The ONLY job Google's ad has is to get in front of people. The copy has a job, the landing page or answering person (if they call) has a job, the intake / presenter has a job. If one link is broken the whole system is inefficient. 

Like most service businesses, the least expensive client is from your database. Marketing through your database will yield great results. "How?" Give to get. If you want referrals from other attorneys then GIVE referrals to them. No one likes people with their hand out, but would help someone who helped them. 

Marketing costs time and money. Not in equal portions. Figure out what you have more of. If you have more money than time then pay for ads and SEO. If you have more time, I am a big fan of YouTube. It is free unlimited advertising. Long form works, so does short form. They are both tools to be used differently. A Solo's biggest problem is obscurity, no one knows you're an attorney. Awareness videos help with this. Again, the video's job is to get in front of people, you still need to convert them to signed contracts. Your presentation and offer need to be really good. 

Pick one marketing leg and build it out. Then when that's done, add automation to it and start with the next marketing leg. Don't start building multiple marketing legs and end up with zero completely ones.

> What's the angle here? Because honestly, the answer is that there's a lot of reasons that can be individual to that lawyer. 

1.  Many states require or encourage lawyers to take pro-bono cases as a public service by the bar to the public and require some reporting of that as a part of annual licensing.  The American Bar association encourages this.  Some lawyers do generally view it as a community service.    https://www.americanbar.org/groups/probono_public_service/policy/arguments/ 


2.  Depending on the context, lawyers may have particular cases or causes that they care about and choose to take pro-bono. It may be friends and family, political affiliation, or genuine community service.   Doing pro-bono work is also a good networking activity in some context. 

3.  At the end of the day "out of pocket" expenses for any particular case for most lawyers are small, it's just time and effort. Don't get me wrong, if you charge for your time as your profession, your time is valuable.  But a lawyer taking on a pro-bono case with a small time commitment is not the same as  say, requiring a contractor to build a free house (which requires a substantial financial commitment). 

4.  Lawyers, in some cases, particularly in the criminal or family law context, will get stuck by ethics rules on cases where they haven't been paid but cannot withdraw due to prejudice to their clients.  This varies state by state. 

I don't do a lot of "true" pro-bono cases, but I do a lot of community service work. I'm on the board of my local law library, I'm on the board of the local food pantry. For several years I coached the local town high school's mock trial team as a volunteer.   (I also teach at two colleges as an adjunct professor).

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-05 | 1pts | `churn_billing, pricing` | Mentions: **Smith.ai**

> I saw several other post something similar, and you usually ask the same question.  I use smith.ai to answer my main line, and I only pay $10 a month for them.  They screen sales calls out for free.  Legitimate calls I pay them $10 a call for, with a minimum of $10 a month.  My volume fluctuates significantly, so this deal works out so well for me.

I was once very skeptical of a virtual reception service when I thought they were killing expensive leads for a client.  I put together a quality control where the line forwarded to a cloud service that recorded every call and used ai to both transcribe the call to an email notification and ran sentiment analysis on it, notifying if it detected a call going sideways.  The service forwarded right through to the virtual reception line, so it was like in the middle.  Of course, the act of recording and ai analysis was announced on the line for privacy and eavesdropping concerns, and it was disabled for callers from Illinois because of BIPA.  

I only ran this for like 3 or 4 months before I was satisfied with the service, then I cut it out to reduce cost.  Always an option if you think your VR might suck.  There are a lot of them out there that sell themselves as legal only, or even run by and mostly staffed by recovering attorneys.  Others, like smith.ai, that offer options to use your scheduler, collect payments or run conflicts checks for you.  I think if you are going that route, it is well worth shadowing their work for a bit to make sure you are getting what was promised.

If you want to know how I got smith.ai price down so low, you'll have to DM me.

Long live Beryl Howell.

> Now on to Gross Profit.

**Step 1. Calculate Cost of Sales (Labor)**
Calculate how much it costs, in labor, to service your clients. Including your time, contractors, etc.

The idea here is to ask and answer: "How many hours total does it cost to service clients?"

Let's say it takes an average of 10h per client across all roles. Break down how much time is spent per role to calculate capacity per role. You'll use this downstream to know when to hire to meet your demand.


**Step 2. Calculate Cost of Sales (Software)
Calculate how much you spend on software to service your clients. Clio Manage, law libraries, document prep software, Word, cloud storage, etc.

These are only software related to actually services the client. Not just to run your business (those are operating expenses).

**Step 3. Calculate Other Cost of Sales**
Filing fees, document prep fees, copy making, paper, ink, etc. Again, things directly associated with actually servicing a client.

---
Add all of that up for the same period you calculated CAC for and you have your **Cost of Sales**.

Now, calculate your Gross Profit for that same period by subtracting all Cost of Sales from Gross Revenues.

Gross Profit = Gross Revenue – Cost of Sales

*Gross Revenue is really Lifetime Gross Revenue; the total amount of money you make from all customers over time before subtracting costs.*

And *Gross Profit* is really Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP); the total amount of gross profit you make from all customers over time.

Take LTGP and divide it by the # of clients and you get your average LTGP per customer.

Now you can calculate your LTGP:CAC ratio.

---
## Improving the Ratio
Improving the ratio comes down to two things:

1. Reduce your costs
2. Increase revenue

For most businesses at your stage, you should focus on increasing revenue before reducing costs. A lot of folks get this backwards in the early years, run out of steam, and go bankrupt.

### Increase Revenue
There's only two ways to increase revenue:

1. Get more people to buy from you.
2. Get people to pay more.

And yes, people buy from you. Your service is your product.

## Get More to Buy
Tell more people about your stuff—that's **advertising**; it doesn't have to be paid media either.

**Increase availability** 
This is the single biggest point of leverage I see firms lose out on.

Take more calls. Follow up more and faster. People don’t just want to hire a lawyer from 9–5 (that's when they're working).

If someone calls you after hours and you don’t answer, they'll call someone else. Whoever answers first is probably gonna get the deal.

You don’t have to do this...and you don't have to make more money either.

Make it as easy as possible. 

Can potential clients text you to inquire about your services? Leads from text messages are 200% higher than form submissions and 80% higher than phone calls across the data I have.

Ruby is very good at dealing with sales calls if you instruct them to never put them through.

> Yes! Using digital tools like ChatGPT, Zoom, and Docusign will put you above the majority of other estate planning attorneys. I just left a small law firm that had everyone come into their (large, posh) office to sign documents and talk to the attorneys. Soon after the firm, the owner laid off people because she couldn't handle the expenses of the firm. We attorneys can be behind other industries that have already adopted tech.. e.g. can you imagine signing real estate documents in person anymore? That's silly. But many law firms still require it. When you talk to clients of solos or small firms, ask them if they were able to talk to their attorneys over Zoom, or sign documents remotely. It's cringe-worthy to hear their answers. And so if you DO offer these services, you're already setting yourself apart from the rest.

After about four months at the Regus I realized that Google was never going to approve the address so I found a different mail drop office.  I had to keep the Regus active as a male drop for at least another year as many of the cases that I started back then had that address as my mailing address.  As a mail drop it wasn’t very expensive.

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> LSAs (Local Service Ads) can work well if you set them up correctly and manage them. The most important thing is to answer or respond to every lead instantly. 

You must review each lead and provide info. If it is a bad lead, you must dispute it to get a credit back for it. 

Ensure you are stacking your reviews and attach the LSA to that Google Business Profile to benefit from both. 

Google is looking to see you work as the lead, and answering every call and responding to every message is very important.

The minimum spend I recommend is 5k a month. For our smaller attorneys, we often see this work to get a case a month.  

We see 20k per month generate a few cases for a Google Ad campaign. Clicks are expensive and the big players ensure their competitors are not getting the best leads.

### r/LawFirm — 2024-12-12 | 5pts | `pricing`

> i’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve been done dirty by a lot of marketing companies.

I’d make a couple of suggestions:

1. Work really hard at getting positive Google reviews. You simply ask clients who you believe or satisfied if they’re willing to give you five stars and to write a word or two.
If you do good job, you should be able to get reviews, but don’t be discouraged if only one or two out of five or 10 people you help actually give reviews.

2. don’t overlook YouTube videos. You can talk about common subjects or questions that your clients ask ask you without giving specifically legal answers. Of course you should always have a disclaimer that it is not legal advice. You’re giving just examples of certain situations and that every situation can be different.

3. I’m a big fan of “do it yourself“ websites and content let’s face it you are the product that people are considering purchasing. For that reason, I think it’s best that the content you post to be your very own. This takes time but when I have downtime, I use it for this and for the videos, which means I seldom have downtime as I use any spare time for marketing.

4. There are several platforms that basically offer some version of a “do it yourself kit for making a website. There are ones like Wix that are not specific to law firms. I am very fond of and us Lawlytics as they are budget, friendly and geared towards lawyers.

Many other web providers exist, but they usually charge quite a bit of money.

I also think you should avoid the various Legal directories. Door paying them to list your name in their directory and usually you don’t get a very good return on investment. I’m sure there are some lawyers who’ve had success with companies like AAVO or Legal Match but in my experience, they’ve never been worth the price.

Try not to make the mistake that I did several years ago and using somebody who promised the moon but had a flat fee monthly for their Webb service. It cost me something like 60 grand and almost put me in bankruptcy. fortunately, I learned from the mistake and was able to recover and have implemented the things I’ve discussed above. That said I would really avoid anything that requires a long-term expensive contract. I also would take with a heavy grain of salt. The promise is made by some of the legal marketing companies that you will encounter.

I wish you the best.

> Not the answer you're looking for: let your portable devices be portable devices and your office workstations be office workstations. 

Since you don't need (expensive) GPUs, a decent midrange desktop will curbstomp a laptop four times it's cost.

Dinky pathetic laptops with slow professors and tiny screens often have much, much better battery life.

Set up a network drive for each pair of systems (lappy and desk) and some type of synchronization for anything that doesn't cover.


It'll cost less overall, be far more serviceable down the road (working on desktop hardware is a cakewalk), and when the laptops inevitably croak first, you have a working system AND less money tied up in the more disposable portable one. 


If you were a huge firm maybe it wouldn't be worth the electricity premium but for a two person firm this is the way.

> We are a much newer business than those mentioned. We started in April of 2023 and have been growing our capabilities as we grow our customer base. 

Our dedicated agent service is an agent hired directly for you who only answers your calls and can also do other specific tasks that you need. It’s a completely different service. It’s more like a virtual assistant who answers your phones also and you can train on your crm..etc. 

We use the team model now for all of our customers and keep our team sizes small. 

As for our pricing, the more minutes you use the cheaper it is. It’s difficult to setup a new client and train agents on their specifics so if you just need us for backup it is more expensive, but $169 a month is nothing to have a team covering your phones for ~240 hours a month. That’s consistent with all virtual receptionist services.  We don’t just take a message for that entry level pricing. We can give quotes and schedule appointments. 

We are HIPAA compliant and PCI compliant but right now we don’t take credit cards for any existing customers because of the liability. (Maybe in the future)

We don’t have an app like Ruby, but I don’t think that’s worth double the pricing. We are small but we provide excellent service. So would you get a great customer experience with my team? Yes. Would you get an app? No.

> I have been using [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) since 2016 when I opened my solo family law practice after several years of firm practice. [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) charges by number of calls, not minutes; it doesn't charge for spam/sales calls, answers calls virtually 24/7 (aside from certain holidays); schedules/reschedules appointments, and as mentioned above, integrates with Clio Manage. It also works with Calendly. It offers custom plans and a decent discount for paying yearly up front. Not just an answering service, it does intakes and can filter out unwanted geographic/sub-areas of family law. 

It's not perfect, sometimes inexperienced receptionists get it wrong and you have to be careful with your calling instructions but you can fine-tune that over time. Also if they mess up they will credit the call and call the PC back if you ask. One area where it tends to make mistakes is understanding the geography of my state, which makes sense given that the receptionists are from all over the country. Probably the hardest part of instructions is getting them to understand which counties I accept for some services but not others (e.g. mediation/appeals vs. trial-level work). I don't use their chat service bc it is more expensive than call answering but I imagine it might be helpful for some types of traffic.  Haven't tried the AI-only chat bot option.

> -This comment should be the top one on this question and every other one ever asked about LegalShield. 

The service itself is what i would refer to as a good 'value' if you use it correctly and with the right perspective. Almost all of their plans provide a will/power of attorney document for each member on a plan at no additional cost. so for your $30-$50 bucks you get an attorney discussing and preparing your basic estate plan for you. That alone makes it a good value.

Attorneys generally charge by the hour. So if you have legal concerns that really need an answer, paying $50 for a month's worth of attorneys time is (again) a good value.

It won't fix everything, and won't do everything for you, though.

I think the biggest issue Legalshield/Pre-Paid legal has always dealt with but never really bothered to address is the disconnect in their business model. Being a tiered sales company using outside sales people, they've always had people over-promising the product. There's no incentive or no real check on it since the law firms cannot be directly involved in marketing (ethics) and LS doesn't control the associates directly and harshly enough to control the expectation issue. LegalShield prioritizes catering to their sales associates over their product/the firms, so any concerns about salesmanship are largely ignored. 

If LegalShield ever bothered to actually put the product and the firms first (which would require the sales structure be de-prioritized and forcing it into second position), i think the reputation and value would skyrocket. 

Right now, all of Legalshield's marketing, training, and corporate develop prioritizes getting more sales people into the tiers and securing more associate managers to increase profit potential. That comes at the expense of expectations and market share when the sales model hasn't changed for decades and they refuse to develop an updated strategy to clear the current plateau. They're not going to grow using the same old model, and they're not going to improve their rep by supporting the salesforce over the firms as much as they do.

> In general, there is no single trick for making it work. Rather, think of it as a dozen buckets you set out to catch slow drips of clients. It might feel disappointing to put out a new "facebook page" bucket and not see immediate returns, but when you have dozens of trickles of phone calls it really adds up. 

**Here's what has worked for my EP clients:**

1. Solid SEO on your website. Make sure it's well set-up. However I doubt ongoing SEO will be valuable unless you happen to live in a city where few other EP firms are making an effort. Instead consider the following: 

1a) Write blog posts that answer common EP questions. Most people search in the form of questions. If you have a blog post that is phrased the same as their question, along with the answer, then you'll likely get a call here and there.

1b) Write blog posts that answer uncommon questions. A single blog post that answers a question no other law firm has answered will reliably generate calls for years. 

2. Facebook page - have a facebook page and a way to keep it updated every week or so. The "freshness" shows you are active and hard working. The page itself isn't going to attract new clients, but it is one of the things people check on when researching you. 

3. YELP - Don't bother advertising with yelp, but do have a business listing and work hard to get a few 5-star reviews from your clients.  Again, this won't attract new clients but lots of people research there, so you want to have a good rating. 

4. Google business listing - Probably your most important listing. Call friends, family, and anybody who might give you a good review and get a few on there. One very important aspect of this tool is to ask people to specifically mention "estate planning lawyer" or some other variation of what you do. Google treats this like gospel and if everybody in your reviews is saying you're great with estate plans, it is way more likely to show you to people looking online. 

5. Youtube - Again, it's unlikely a video of yours will result in calls (but it can happen), but I am always surprised at the number of clients who say "I was researching you and saw your video about...." You don't have to go crazy, just have a channel and a handful of videos that let you introduce yourself and the firm by perhaps answering a few questions, or describing the EP process for new clients. 

All of that is possible to do for free yourself. Here's the paid stuff:

6. Do a few online searches and see who and what already ranks for your key phrases. For example, if stupid AVVO ranks #1 for "estate plan lawyer" then consider trying out a listing on AVVO for a while and see if it generates calls.  If they don't appear, then don't waste your money. Some jurisdictions will have random sites like "thumbtack,' or "ELocal" or some other small-time directory show up #1. If they rank well in your area, try them out.  

7. Paid lead services - paid lead services can work, but are usually overpriced and often do not wo

But seriously, learn the basics yourself. There's four hundred or so ranking factors and you can learn them and save that money if you're just starting out. It's not that complicated.  When the money is rolling in you can hire someone to optimize.  Often, people hire agencies and lose a lot of money. 


Start with local service ads, possible AdWords (now google ads) with a heavily optimized landing page (you can learn how to do this yourself) or just copy what's working with other malpractice injury firms focusing on birth law (check the results in major cities in AdWords and don't click on their actual AdWords ads but copy the ad destination address to see their landing page for inspiration).  If you click on their ad they have to pay, so be courteous and just go see the destination address manually inputted into Google. 


I'm a lawyer like you, but I know marketing extremely well. Working on CLEs currently. 


Use negative keywords and focus well on your speciality to get a high quality score. This you could work with specialists on. It's not expensive for them to set up and you can earn a good profit which you can reinvest in SEO with specialists downstream. 


I've also seen YouTube videos that don't take more than a few hours to make rack up thousands of views pertaining to personal injury around birth /medmal so there's that too to augment your efforts. 


Finally, if you need a more sophisticated approach become a topical authority on birth law on your website.  


For example, go to Google, type in your relevant phrases ...and peep the "People also ask" phrases around Birth injury. 


Eg how long do I have to sue etc 


Write answers to these on your website. 
It's free and you'll eventually rank for these queries yourself. 


Then go to Google autocomplete and do this same thing again around the permutations. 


Eg type birth injury lawyers into Google and have a look at what google suggests re autocomplete (eg rates, locations, near me) and use this to build related phrases into your blog. 


While there's over four hundred factors, this approach will give you a user friendly approach that google loves to get started.  Write it for a friend, your mother, a sister or an aunt to make it more personalized. 


Get feedback from your target audience. 


You can then look at things like AnswerThePublic or sites that give you all the queries and more advanced tools like SEMRush. 


This will give you more advanced analysis of how to rank for the words including competitor analysis and more complicated topics like backlink analysis.There are videos which describes this.  


Then there's technical site optimizations. There are a variety of free tools that will show you exactly how to optimize your site and what's missing. You can run the reports yourself and then pay someone for minor fixed, it's not too expensive in most cases when you know what you're doing/looking for and the marketers know you're not an easy target to get ripp

> Hey there,

Well, you've got so many questions here. So, to answer this, I have to charge you... for FREE. :)

I was a former web designer and developer of one of the largest lawyer directories and now going solopreneur.

I prefer to use the term "SEO-friendly" for the SEO "built-in" term.

Let me grab all your concerns here:

1. Does a website need to be "SEO-friendly"?
2. Does an "SEO-friendly" website lead to an SEO contract proposal?
3. How much to spend monthly for SEO to be worked?
4. How much is the monthly cost of a website to run (not including SEO service)?

I will give you simple answers to your questions.

**(1) Yes, you are correct.**

Your website should be user-friendly. But it has nothing to do with an SEO contract. Mostly, modern-design website template has included 'SEO-friendly' as the minimum feature.

So, what makes a website "SEO-friendly"?

1. It has a good structure on the page, such as a page should have a minimum of one (1) HTML tag of H1 and has another H2 and H3 for subtitles.
2. The website should have breadcrumbs.
3. The website should have an XML sitemap to register on GSC.
4. Website load speed should be under 3 seconds.
5. That's all for now.. :)

**(2) No, it isn't.**

SEO service is a separate task from building a website. But, if you hire an SEO service, one of their jobs is to make your website "SEO-friendly" (if it isn't already).

**(3) Normally, you will see the result within 3 - 6 months.**

But here is the caveat. When you see your website rank is good on SERP, doesn't mean all the work is done. You still need to maintain the page. That's why some SEO agencies or freelancers offer monthly contracts. If you don't maintain the page, it could sink into the search engine results.

**(4) There are many parameters to put into consideration to answer this one.**

Where is the website hosted? Do you have a paid third-party plugin (if using WordPress)? Do you have another service integrated into the website? But for normal use, building a website could cost you around $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the complexity. This is just for development, not including the cost of hosting and domain. Some big agencies could charge you way more expensive.

**Simplest solution..?**

Using WaaS (Website as a Service). This is a rare term used in the internet. WaaS is a website builder platform where you can use the built-in template and all that you need is already provided on the template. With WaaS, you will save a lot more money and time.

I recommend you to check this [WaaS for legal website](https://www.tobapro.com/). This is a WaaS specific for legal websites.

They have a free trial for 7 days and you can try it for free. Worth trying.

> Was marketing Google Local Service Ads, 500 per week at first. Getting a $6 return on every dollar spent. I’ve since transitioned my practice to immigration and crim to crim with some civil. Also getting court appointed work so have not been advertising last few months. 

With local service ads for immigration I found it really only worked if I narrowed my categories. If you have ads going into business immigration or asylum, or immigration court. You’re still going to get blasted with all kinds of irrelevant calls. People wanting to answer “quick questions” that are not so quick and rather complex and those questions are deep into immigration world I did not practice in. Business imm not the removal defense I know.

So you’ll need to spend a significant amount of time and money playing with their system to dial it in. Eventually I closed all Ads for anything except for affirmative asylum which was a bit more expensive per lead my ad spend increased $800. That pushed me to finally stop marketing. 

Also pay attention to bad leads and dispute, they’re pretty decent about crediting bad leads. Be careful with confidentiality, the incoming calls are on recorded lines so make sure to answer accordingly or advise PC.

> I graduated from a Tie r 1 and followed the yellow brick road to BigLaw.
Just over a year later got laid off subsequent to the great Lehman massacre.
Spent several years trying to find a way to keep a roof over my head and keep my dogs. I vowed to myself that when I got back on my feet I would never be dependent on an employer again.

Moved to a low COLA city, travelled to some highly compensated foreign language doc reviews to start saving up for rental properties. Also worked for a CPA who worked for HNW families and celebrities so I learned how to do bookkeeping. Gradually got a few properties going which now mean I wake up on the first of the month with the mortgages paid and about $3k to put toward my day by day operating expenses. I.e. they net about $36k/year after debt service and property taxes (yes, I made substantial improvements in each to get them from how I bought them to justifying those rents.)

While scouting for properties I got cold called by a realtor and switched to him. I figured out how to close my own houses and he asked me if I wanted him to refer me clients. I said sure and promptly approached a local lawyer who did real estate and asked him if I brought the clients and gave him 50% of my fees would he cover my malpractice insurance and teach me how to do it. He said sure.

After about 6 months to a year I could do 99% of a deal front to back with my eyes closed and adjusted my split to 90/10. Within two years that realtor, who had cold called me as his very first cold call, became the #1 producing agent in a top 3 brokerage in our region. One of his clients left sales to become a realtor and is now #10. Other realtors saw that I was a lone wolf, completely independent from the political BS and the kickbacks that abound here, and started throwing me deals.

After three years I approached the title company I work with (who I picked because they are the best and the fastest and not because one of the local real estate brokerages is telling me I need to pay them $800 a month  and use their preferred title company to get referrals) and asked them to teach me how to be examining counsel. They did and now I get EC fees on my purchaser deals, and am additionally able to deliver my deals that much faster than other attorneys who use the bigger and slower title companies and don't write their title commitments themselves.

The bookkeeping was my main gig before the real estate took off and I still keep a small group of pet bookkeeping clients (one of them pays 100% of my health insurance so that's taken care of, and the rest nets about $1k a month on top). Being a business management consultant yourself and having a professional level understanding of bookkeeping comes in REAL HANDY when your solo side gig starts taking off and you need to start doing your own escrow accounting for a real estate heavy practice.

If you are organized, do not procrastinate, and can keep track of several moving parts, real estate has an excellent do

Other services like Podium or Broadly have similar features, but overall, I think [Zidy is the one](https://www.zidy.com/) that stands out from the crowd due to all the tools it offers.  
Zidy’s newest addition, Zidy AI, can help you manage online reviews through automated responses, where the tool can write and reply to answers for you very professionally without you checking it.  
Besides that, the software helps you keep track of reviews cross-platforms, organizing everything into one big panel where all of them are present. I started using this service last year, and it doubled my reviews, so I’d recommend you try it too.

> I've been doing legal advertising for 20 years. It is one of the most expensive areas for digital advertising.

I've got a lot I could say, but here are the basics...

*Make sure people can find and reach your practice easily.*

This is job one.

Make sure that people can find you and actually get contacted back quickly.   You've spent a fortune getting this person, don't drop the ball when they do. Phone must be answered appropriately. Phone number and email addresses accurate. No dead links.

 Google still weighs location above many other things. So make sure your domain name addresses however it is people find you. If they mostly find you by name and your group pops up easily, then you are fine.  If people can't find you without already knowing your site, you might consider updating your domain to something that addresses location and potentially  your practice area because that way your practice area and location are everywhere on your site aitomatically. You can still keep your practice name domain as a landing page. But your main site needs a name that fully supports your SEO.

THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON MISTAKE I SEE. A BAD DOMAIN.  Although it's nowhere near as common as it used to be.

These are things that are often not a one time job, but need to be monitored. 


*Spend some time on keywords.*
  The biggest success I ever had was using the form names used in an obscure branch of government law for ads and SEO because the only people that used that term were people who potential clients for this firm.  

Get real familiar with your firm's practice areas and how people find your practice areas. Note, this is different  if you are a name brand firm in your area this may be less important, but not much.  Basic content marketing and basic seo (tags and file labels and image labels and blogs and H1/H2  headings reflecting your search needs)  are basically free and shoukd be done as a matter if course. This takes discipline mainly. 

*Focus more on relationship marketing.*

Real talk, most big deals are done on the golf course, not the internet.

Even if you are a small firm that needs awareness to even get started,  building relationships with people that cab feed you business should be your main focus. CPAs and other professionals that work with business owners mainly.  Or if you get work from other firms, work on those relationships.  People hire people they know and trust.  Look at who those people are in your life. If your principles/partners are utterly incapable, you need to hire someone who can fill this role.

Other stuff that works:

Lunch and learns, as well as teaching classes can give you a reason to contact potential trial clients and keep you top of mind plus can provide evergreen content to support seo if recorded.

PR in terms of news stories, partners awards, charity events where your firms name is prominent.

Billboards- highly dependent  on area in terms roi..

A pretty website is worthless if no one sees it.

> A template always helps.  However, absent a template work through the case in your head.  Research and review for complaint, draft complaint, file complaint, filing and service fees, receipt and review of answer, case mgt conference, written discovery, depositions, mediation/settlement conferences, motions- MSJ, motions in limine, etc, hearings on motions, pre trial conference, pre trial brief, exhibit prep, prepare for trial, trial.  Put a note that it does not include any post trial work.  Don’t forget costs and expenses, time for calls letters and emails and when you are done double it all.  Unless it will scare the client away, providing sufficient cushion by far beats going over budget.

> I wrote this a few months ago. Still generally true, so posting it below. But a couple of minor updates:

- feel like the customer support is regressing - maybe related to them signing up too many customers without equivalently growing their customer support team.
- they keep talking about having some kind of secret sauce behind how they choose the right llm in responding to queries, but it has been difficult getting substantial details about that. Hopefully in the near future. Related to the above point. 

-----

I agree with some of this, and disagree with some of this. I use Harvey regularly, and have done so for the last 12-ish months. I'm at a non-US firm with about 5000 people worldwide. 

AGREE
- Harvey is a wrapper. They seem to have given up on substantially "tuning" the models that they use. They just announced that they are making available Claude and Gemini (in addition to GPT) - Expanding Harvey's Model Offerings

I don't necessarily see this as a negative. My general view of LLMs is that they will become commoditised, and the value will be in the layer(s) that sit on top of the LLM - there are so many good LLMs now. 

- Harvey is expensive. We got a substantial discount in the first couple of years for getting an enterprise licence. But it'll become very expensive (I don't have the exact figure, but USD1000/seat/month sounds about right for a rack rate). So if I was running my own firm or part of a small firm, I wouldn't look at Harvey for that reason alone - there's too much competition out there, whether from foundation models or from wrapper companies. 

- A lot of Harvey is hype. They clearly have a very solid, dedicated marketing / PR team. They do interviews with the right crowd, their blogs are very polished, and their founder's public messaging always stay on point. I mean... it's Silicon Valley. 

- I have generally been unimpressed thus far with the workflows. They have just introduced a "customs workflows" feature for building my own workflows, and a "playbooks" feature for building playbooks based on existing documents. Both of these have have some promise, but I need to test them more to have a strong view either way. 

DISAGREE
- I have found Harvey useful - so I disagree with OP's general negativity about the product.

It is definitely not perfect. But a couple of comments there:

(1) It has improved massively since I first tried it in 2023. My view (that I told my firm about) at the time was that Harvey was crap, and we shouldn't get it until it improved massively. I also think when they first started out, they tried too hard at tuning (see above). 

(2) There are three main positives about Harvey that I see now. 
1 - the wrapper is straightforward, simple and easy to use - this is a very big deal for busy lawyers who don't want to deal with crap interfaces. 
2- the output is generally good. At an individual level - document summarisation, BD article preparation, short advice writing, sense checking answers, bouncing

So for me answer is no. But there are dozens of companies will say the opposite. Depends on the budget, objectives and if they are on the market for long or just beginners. 


More over - nowadays customers do not buy only by seeing something on SM channels (especially service or more expensive things). They research, check if company is not a scam, reviews and so on. Having some sm channel is nowadays a must imo but more as support for website (when customer see your page in SERP, will also check how your brand "talks" in sm), announcement board and sharing knowledge channel, than lead gen platform.

> In the very early days, I did the whole "buy a bucket of hours" thing, like 10 hours for $1000, or whatever the pricing was. It's a total pain in the ass.

 - It's not MRR because they only want to buy when they need to refill their bucket of hours
 - You're still working by the hour
 - What about when they don't use all of their hours in one month? Now you're in a roll over situation, could roll over month to month and accumulate. 
- it’s an accounting nightmare to track
- the client never really trust you when you say you use X number of hours for a task

It's just a pain in the ass. I stopped doing that pretty quickly.

The way that I price recurring services is frankly unstructured.

I look at it as a whole, and I usually chunk into things like teams. So as an example, when it comes to the web team, if I add up all of their MRR and then I add up all of their expenses in a month, am I making the profit margin that I want? That's kind of like take number one on pricing.

Next, I confirm that the price that I'm paying is not too low for the marketplace and not too high that it’s going to drive people away, even if I am hitting my profit margins. I really don't want to be making too much money frankly because then I'm just opening myself up for clients to leave for cheaper options in the future.

The final evaluation is the company as a whole, certainly in startup mode, you're not going to have the volume that you will in a couple of years, making it tough at first. I just need to make money every single month, which means I change my pricing as my volume and expenses change. 

I price in totality of the company to be quite honest with you - how is the whole company doing vs. individual services.

I know it's not scientific. I've tried going down to, like, how much do we make per hour and profit per service and person. I've done all that analysis, and frankly, it just doesn't work. I keep it very simple. The natural tendency is to make it complex with tons of data analysis, and let the data decide. Or price way higher than you should and hope for the best in the end. But in the end, it just doesn't matter as long as I'm pricing it properly for the client, pricing it properly for the market, pricing it properly for me, and I make money every month in totality, not at the line item level.

All that said, I don't want to take a hit on any given line item. For example, if you are losing money on something like say a website because you then make money on something else as an add-on like SEO. It's very easy and natural for you to say to yourself, "Well, websites are a loss leader … it’s ok.” That’s a fool's folly. You should never knowingly lose money at any level.

I know I didn’t give you a direct answer. I don’t think there is one. I also think that when people try to make it overly scientific, that’s when they get into trouble. I’m not saying, don’t analyze… You should. But it really comes down to a gut call that someone, you, needs to make.

> Hello Erik, I hope you’re still monitoring this thread as I would greatly appreciate a little bit of insight for a very specific situation that I’m currently going through. 


Background: 
Started in 4/2024 after being laid off from agency. 100% referrals for client base. I’m up to 15-20k per month. Started as niche on local service businesses. A nursery and a lawyer fell in my lap so I help them but my focus is local services in my dma. 

Question / problem I’m seeking input on: 
Currently, my largest client, a service provider of expensive outdoor projects. I have a great relationship with the owner, they very much appreciative of efforts. There is an older family member that handles the finances that has recently gotten involved in email threads, very impolite and a bit rude (this doesn’t really matter, but I’ve busted my ass for the results so I’m a bit butt hurt full transparency) (they had very poor digital presence before I got involved). I “fought” for about a month have them agree to implement form posting direct to crm & utilizing call tracking software. This has been done since mid April 2025, until then they were relying on office staff to answer phones & receive email submissions and manually entering leads into crm. 

They have been able to close about 400k in jobs since January - may from my efforts that were tracked in their crm (more accurate since April) total spend with fees is about 20k per month. Finance person is critiquing roi - fair enough. But the kicker is: 

There is 5m in estimate sent / estimate viewed status since January from my sources. I’m trying to convince them on an automated nurture sequence via sms / email as their current sales disqualifier is 3 calls/text no answer - mark as lost. 

How would you balance being a consultant to the company vs avoid spinning wheels with going back and forth with this finance person… the owner has not gotten involved in this conversation voluntarily yet - I know I need to pull him in. 

Basically, if you’re willing, I’m trying to avoid learning this one the hard way and am seeking some type of opinion on the matter. Lmk if you have any questions.

> yes so firstly ai to lower op/costs but also adding more value to your clients by additional services. as someone mentioned earlier all good making seo/ads/whatever work but if the sales process etc is lacking its an expensive problem to have. 

Maybe the answer is - 'we help you get the RIGHT traffic and interest, then we give you the systems you need to actually close revenue' 

value add for existing customers (growth and retention) + can service different types/new customers. start to position yourselves as more than just seo which is increasingly seen to be commoditized 'why am i paying this when i can get a guy in \_\_\_\_ to do it for $3.50 p/h' 

might be a learning curve for you but you sound pretty capable based on your posts + you could outsource or partner with someone.

> Let me tell you something most agency owners won't admit: 90% of agency acquisitions are garbage. You're buying someone else's problems.

600% growth sounds impressive until you realize what you're actually buying: a bunch of founder-dependent client relationships that will bolt the second the original owner checks out. Those $300-400k EBITDA shops usually have one rainmaker and a revolving door of talent.

At my agency in Armenia, we passed on acquiring three US agencies because they all had the same hidden problem: their profits came from overworking underpaid juniors who were already halfway out the door.

Don't buy an agency because of their service list. Everyone claims to do everything. Buy them for their client RETENTION rate. If clients stay 3+ years, that's gold. If they churn after 18 months, you're buying a treadmill, not an asset.

The smartest acquisition isn't the "complementary service" - it's the agency with a reliable client acquisition system that doesn't depend on the founder's LinkedIn posts.

Ask these questions before buying:

* What's your client churn rate?
* How many clients came from referrals vs. outbound?
* How many employees have been there 3+ years?

The answers tell you if you're buying an actual business or just an expensive hiring problem.

> This is something that comes up almost universally in marketing services businesses that are  1-5 years in. It is a dangerous cycle. But it is a cycle. 

That means you can create that cycle or end it. It’s easy to start with one client who isn’t a fit because you have overhead. Then you take another and another until your available billable time is full of shitty clients.

There will always be bread and butter work, clients who are difficult or work that’s not top dollar. That’s normal. The problem is when you get locked in the cycle.

Shedding those clients is hard because now you need every penny to run because shitty clients eat margin. If you keep going with them you’ll ruin your firms reputation.

The answer is setting minimum and ideal client profiles and being willing to say “no” even when your wallet is saying “yes, yes!”.

That is where capitalization comes in. You need a line of credit or a cash cushion to get through the slow times. 

Then it‘s possible to cut clients who are not a fit (you’ll be doing them a favor) one at a time as you replace them with better clients at full rates.

I still get tempted to help out somebody at my expense I often say no because my time is better spent seeking out those better clients than working to keep the lights on with cheap, pain in the ass clients. 

Sometimes a client starts out looking like a fit and then becomes toxic. We fire them. Many firms cut the bottom 10% every year.

Source: this is a big topic of discussion in an online community of agency founders. As an advisor for agencies I have lived it in my company (more than once) and seen it regularly with clients. It’s just too damn easy to fall off the horse. 

But you can do it with grit, a clear target and money.

> Thank you. I started my agency in parallel with 2 other guys who also started theirs in the same niche. And we met 2 more guys doing the same thing. Lead gen + appointment setting for Medspas.

Yes I would agree, I went a completely different route than they did right off the bat. They were much more confident in their service delivery (which back then, was based on nothing) and went almost straight away towards growing their client base. 

I do not say what I do not know. Which made it really difficult for me to sell my marketing services, even though I was the only one with professional sales experience. I was only comfortable asking to work for free with an extremely small commission on the backend. 

I knew nothing about the space: not what their services did, the effectiveness of the services compared to others, downtime, COGs, length of treatment, what tier of skilled labor was required, etc. 

I thought Botox was for lips.

My first client was cheap, that’s why she took me on. But I got very lucky. She offered like every service the space has. Over 150 different services.

I mapped every service on an excel sheet and had multiple, multi hour meetings with the owner every Sunday going over every treatment to answer all of the above questions.

In the meantime, I already sold a few moderately high-ticket, very profitable packages for her and she started to trust my judgement. Which allowed me to create an excel calculator with the treatments I found, from talking with her client base over the phone, people would want.

With essentially being allowed to do whatever I wanted, I would call her client list and based on my deduction from the discovery, I’d make a custom package for them in real time and say, “Well Sarah, you’re not going to believe it, the promo we’re running today is EXACTLY what you’ve been looking for”.

This really accelerated my knowledge of, not only the space, but also another business skill I wasn’t aware I was building: creating offers people want to buy. And being able to gauge if this was a good or a bad package based on their reaction over the phone.

Mined you, I was losing money this whole time. Was a week away from homelessness. That triggered me to finally push for “monetization”. It’s really been up ever since. The rock bottom situation was last June.

But the reason why I’m sharing this, is because you’re right. I remember just a few weeks before I hit financial and emotional rock bottom, I was talking with one of the previously mentioned guys.

He was already collecting around $10k/m (rev), which at the time seemed like an insurmountable task. And it was all from service delivery! 

He was telling me about his packages, and me obviously being familiar with the business numbers behind the treatments in those packages, told him that his clients aren’t making any gross profit from his services. Yeah, the revenue numbers look great, but after you take into account COGs AND acquisition costs, the value is literally

> There are a few elements my agency friends work on. This is a grab bag of advice. 

1. Start putting x% of every dollar you earn into an owners equity account before expenses. If you plan for profit from the start you will actually build a business. 

2. Write out and automate all your operating procedures. If you do it twice start writing. If you do it three times it’d better be perfect. 

3. Look at your SOPs you’ve been building. What are you doing more often? Those are your best services to sell. 

4. Simplify your offering to one sentence your clients can repeat to another colleague at a networking event when they are complaining about their own business problems. This will be very concrete and specific. Senders.co is my favourite example. Went from a cold outreach agency to focusing only on email deliverability. Clients could then have this conversation, “hey my emails keep going to spam. How do you set up your email outreach?” “Well I got a friend who solves all my email deliverability. I’ll introduce you.”  You need to be someone’s “I got a friend…” answer. 

5. You need to focus on building pipeline enough that you can turn away at least 30% of clients in an up market. In a down market this will give you a buffer. 

5.1. Client acquisition comes from having a simple problem solution position as I mentioned
5.2 Write out your expertise in detail
5.3 Speak at events
5.4 Invite your prospects to workshops to help them solve a small part of their problems. 
5.5 Find a larger partner who can downstream partners to you like a big software company or another large agency; use their marketing channel to push your thought leadership and workshops. 
5.6. Network network network. Find out where your clients are going and go there too. Use your clients to introduce you or give you a favorable review live during the networking event. 
5.7. Ask every client for a referral.

6. Keep your old book of business engaged. Old clients are future clients. You should be recovering at least 10% of old clients. I’d aim for 25%. 

7. Track time. Optimize. Automate. Cut. 

8. Learn how to find other problems your clients have and then offer to solve them. Don’t just sell what team members you have on your bench. Learn to continuously find problems you can serve. 

9. Be resourceful on staffing. Meet other agencies you can subcontract to. Us Upwork or a specialist like InCommon. Fake it until you make it. Whatever. 

10. Keep your existing team training. Cycle in training time.

11. Increase your rates.

12. Business development is more important than fulfillment. You can always find someone to fulfil. You can’t always find clients.

That’s just a braindump from the Agency Cocktails club I ran. It’s not necessarily applicable to you, but maybe something in there clicks. The most important is actually the first point. Plan to be profitable or you’ll never be profitable.

> Congrats on being good at cold emailing! Lots of folks find the vast scale of it draining, so kudos for lasting through that initial stress.

The key to a good "productized email marketing service" is going to be differentiating yourself from what's out there. Just a quick search on Reddit, Google, or TikTok is gonna bring up like 50 hustle bros that say they're already the best at what you're trying to sell.

Saw you listed services in one of the other comments. Here's my thoughts:

*  You said "Email Campaigns: Up to 10 per month"
   * That's a good baseline package. I recommend if you're trying to sell different services, come up with a few tiers that people can choose from. If you're looking to sell 10, then offer, 5, 10, 25, and 100. Most folks aren't going to want to take the cheapest or the most expensive, and they'll typically take 10. If they take 5, try to upsell them after a few months. If they take 25 or 100, pop some champagne.
* You said "Subject Line Creation, Copy Editing, A/B Testing: Testing of subject lines and content"
   * All that's pretty standard/expected, and can mostly be done by ChatGPT at this point. I think it's best to just say they're included and move on. You're not going to differentiate yourself with any of these. 
* You Said "Analytics: Advanced reporting with engagement analysis"
   * Make sure you have some examples ready for clients to review, since everyone says they have analytics. Good reporting can separate you from the rest.
* You said "Support: Priority email support with a 24-hour response time"
   * That's a major selling point. Customer service can be make or break, so I would think about offering something beyond even email support, like your cell phone or WhatsApp.

Anyway, I know it's been a few months since you actually posted, so hopefully you've made some progress! Our agency sells similar campaigns, but there's endless emails to sell so happy to answer some questions even for our competition :)

> When you go to the dealership and they upsell you on the bells and whistles, heated seats, heads up display, etc. The answer to “do I really need this?” Is probably “No”. You have to paint the picture for the client, and many in the thread have done a great job at doing so by explaining the potential benefits like better SEO control, data acquisition, and non-reliance on a third party vendor that is probably more expensive in the long term than your services and the cost to host the site. 

They might not actually need it right now, but you need them to understand that it would make their life easier, your services are solving their problems that they don’t know they have yet, but it’s up to you to convince them that they WILL and you’re going to help them get ahead of those problems. 

Your job isn’t building websites, it’s selling websites as a website service.

> Who is your target market and what type of videos do you do? Are there specific sectors you specialise in? 

Do your clients advocate for you/give testimonials? The most successful videographers I know have grown their businesses by recommendation/word of mouth, or because they got one or two big name companies (even if that’s ‘big’ on a local level) that gave them credibility for new clients to trust them. This is helped even more if they’ve got onto a preferred supplier list in bigger organisations. Marketing managers who go on to other companies will use them because they know and trust them. This can make it hard for other videographers to compete because it’s a bit like finding a good hairdresser - once you find them you hold onto them! 

As a long-time buyer of videography services, I definitely think the market’s changed. Brands that get customers on Facebook, insta and TikTok etc can get away with phone and app edited videos, reels etc, especially if they’re churning out a lot of them. That’s not to say that all social media managers are any good at video or even design/graphics - but some are and it works for their audience. 

That said, I know companies that pay for videographers to come and film and edit batches of content in one go that they can use for their socials over time.

Some companies, particularly those with small budgets, may have a go at making longer videos that would normally be something they’d hire a videographer for (with varying results!). If there’s someone in house who says they can do it, the technology is readily available then they’ll try and save a few quid.

I used to take a more hands on role with videographers eg I’d storyboard, script and do the interviews (I’d be edited out, but would be the one getting the interviewee to say what I wanted them to). However I don’t have time for all that now, so I use a company that, while more expensive, once briefed and I approve their approach, goes off and does everything. The final edit usually goes back and forth a few times, but they always do a good job. 

We’ve recently started doing more animated videos eg to convey company successes/facts and stats or explainer videos. The company we use for conventional videos, make animations too so I didn’t have to look elsewhere, but I know not all do so that could be an area to get into if you’re not offering that already.

If budgets are being squeezed then I can see some companies dropping or cutting back on videography, but there’ll always be sectors/organisations that need them. 

OP: whether this is a temporary lull or a permanent shift, if you’ve been going for six years, you’ve got this! You may need to tweak your target market, offer, marketing and/or pricing (by that I don’t mean becoming the cheapest in town - sometimes  raising your rates is the answer).

> I agree with the other comment about targeting startups. Especially if they have capital (VC-backed or self-funded). The angle for idea-stage can be a quick, confidential and well-polished MVP, which can go a long way if they're planning to fundraise/pitch. Sure the barrier to making MVPs is lower with nocode tools etc, but this drives higher scrutiny, competition and standards, which is where your expertise shines.

If it's more of a bootstrapped startup, you can probably negotiate a small equity share in lieu of higher upfront compensation. Obviously this is riskier but if you believe in the product, team and vision, the reward can be greater.

Aside from startups, consider the many successful businesses with established cashflow and traction in their market. Advances in AI and computing present an opportunity for many of them to modernize their workflows. Changing market conditions are pressuring many to adapt (increase their capacity to serve excess demand) or answer surging expenses (increase efficiency by cutting costs to remain profitable). In either case this will push many to vertically integrate (where you come in to build their outsourced tools in-house, or to leverage their data and SOPs with AI and automation). 

In many cases this looks like you assessing their tech stack and logically designing in-house product to replace these services and save them in the long run on subscriptions and retainers. Or if you go the AI/automation route, consulting to identify those assets and repetitive tasks to spin into systems saving them work hours (and potentially increasing conversion rates or unlocking new offers for a compounding effect).

This agency model (+ AI) is quite attractive to me and I'd love to connect and explore collaborating if anyone is open to expanding their current team or forming a new one.

> I started as a freelance copywriter in direct response, built a direct response agency after, and now I own an educational & agency growth company that helps other agencies connect with their clients.

So I’ve seen this play out personally for myself as well as for hundreads of others.

You’re lucky in the sense that your target audience is easily reachable and highly responsive usually.

I’ll answer your direct questions below:

1. I started my first agency when one of my clients asked me to get the entire sales funnel built for them, since they didn’t have a team available at the time for them to take my copy and implement it in landing pages, automations and emails. They told me to find whatever talent I needed, tell them how much money I need, and get it done. So that’s exactly what I did 😂

2. For you, it should be LinkedIn. Startup founders are extremely active there because that’s how they meet new team members, potential investors and even journalists when they need access to the press. 

Build your authority by posting 3 kinds of content: (1) case studies and examples of your work, (2) thought leadership pieces proving you understand the startup ecosystem and the problems startups face (that you can solve), (3) educational how-to content that provides step-by-step processes to solve the problems you usually deal with, to demonstrate your expertise in your service.

Continuously expand your network with both startup founders, CTOs and VCs (who can be like a factory of clients for you).

Engage with their content, comment on their stuff, like it, share it if relevant.

Start conversations with them focused on networking and building a relationship before selling. 

Build a CRM (you can even do it in Notion) of everyone you engage with, take notes about them, and FOLLOW-UP!

Hop on virtual coffee chats.

Book appointments where relevant.

Structure win-win deals.

Ask for introductions or referrals if relevant.

That’s sort of what your funnel should be like.

3. Tips on hiring: 

- Work with people on a per-project basis as independent contractors before they prove themselves. It can be a very costly mistake to hire the wrong person, they’ll be hard AND expensive to get rid of. 
- Pay talent well and offer as many bonuses as you can. Creative talent is difficult to retain.
- Make an enjoyable work environment, take care of your employees, make everyone feel like a family.
- If someone wants to leave (to start their own thing or otherwise), let them go. If you don’t and instead you propose higher salary, etc. it’s a big mistake and their self-importance will grow excessively and create problems for you further down the road.
- Assess personality-fit before hiring. Ideally you want to assess 3 things: skills, personality, and moral character in your hiring process. Skills are the least important, moral character the most.

That should give you enough food for thought for now. Best of luck!

> What’s up! I run a very profitable SFC agency. I won’t disclose how much here, but I will say my high ticket offer is $15,000. Now I’ll answer your questions as truthful as can be!! 

1. The pros is THE DEMAND which is freaking massive, and also the PROFIT MARGINS, and the fact this is where the market is shifting. People are now buying products directly from social media apps like TikTok. I’ll put things in perspective for you. When I was making $30K a month running my agency, my costs were only about $2,500 a month so I was brining in about $27,000K in profit BUT I’ll tell you also more truth behind that later on

2. Niches: I believing in Niching down but when you’re first started out, you should work with several different niches because you need to find out #1 Who you can drive results best for and #2 Which niche you actually enjoy working best with and #3 Which niches do have the money to work with you. Example, you may be super good at working with online fitness coaches, but completely suck with finance companies. Even though finance companies may have more budget, if you can t provide results for them, you won’t ever grow your business!! However DO keep industries who make money versus don’t in mind. I love working with clients who have very healthy profit margins

3. Edit videos yourself until you can’t anymore. I used to edit myself up until I was making about $6K consistently. Then I learned how to outsource (which this in itself you’ll have to learn how to do properly) 

So this is the truth about SFC Agency. It’s in high demand, which means a lot of people are starting agencies. Because of that, you’ll need to actually drive results and be good at sales to get clients. But if you can do these 2 things, this space is so lucrative. 

I charge $15,000K for my high end service. With just 2 clients, that’s $30,000K a month.

I also offer a $5,000 offer. 

With 4 clients that’s $20,000K a month 

The math shows with just like 7-8 clients you could be making $1,000,000 a year with about 20% expenses 

I won’t say everyone receives this kind of success, however, I will say if you’re determined, you can

> I saw your website and its a little bit confusing.  I mean at least you should add a tagline that people can understand what you do at the first look.

Don't try to attract everyone,  you need to focus on a specific community, a specific type of people. Then make your website concept very clear and your tagline should reflect the whole message in a single line.  

&#x200B;

**Simple and clear concept here:**

Find the people that interested in your service  
Connect with them  
Are you sure you can solve their problem  
Choose one problem to solve  
See the questions they ask   
Find the questions they talking about  
Talk about the solutions  
Choose one platform  
Linkedin,Instagram,facebook etc only one  
Create content   
Still content is king, so its up to you  
You have to make them ask you questions  
Answer them, become a trusted person in the community  
Get a few clients  
Do the best job  
Contnune...  
Im sure they will refer you more clients  
\+ you getting more clients from your personal network  


  
It's not very tough to understand, it's a simple concept but works. Otherwise, you will see a very hard time. There are many other forms of content marketing, but I explained the esiest way.   


If you do cold emailing, cold social outreach that's very frustrating and time consuming. Still works but it will take a lot of time and there's a lot of rejection, so that's demotivate you.   


Paid marketing is expensive. Im getting all of my clients through networking. Only networking.

> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

Seven federal agencies paid $62 million between March 2021 and November 2022 for various contracts awarded to the consulting firm McKinsey;

Federal ministers and executives from the consulting firm McKinsey must explain themselves to elected officials of the standing committee on government operations and budget forecasts;

In 2021, the Legault government called on the consulting firm to obtain advisory services on post-pandemic economic recovery;
During the first months of the pandemic, McKinsey received $35,000 per day to advise the Quebec government.

--- 

"What justifies an open contract for the next 81 years?" asked Bloc Québécois MP Julie Vignola, expressing surprise that the government cannot hire its own specialists for such a long period.

She then questioned public administration professor Amanda Clarke of Carleton University, who has extensively studied the procurement process in the federal government.

"This idea of ​​having open contracts for 81 years seems outrageous," she replied. "I think that's where we have to ask ourselves what the point of having a civil service is."

The contract available online was awarded on August 31, 2019 and is scheduled to end on January 31, 2100. The form does not specify how much the government is to pay. Instead, it is written that it is a $0 contract for professional IT services.

The government has been in turmoil since the beginning of the year after its contracts with the McKinsey firm made headlines again. The total amount reached $104.6 million for 24 contracts awarded since 2015. The three main opposition parties want to force the government to reveal the entirety of the documents.

According to Professor Clarke, such contracts challenge a principle at the heart of the Statute of Westminster: that of a neutral, merit-based civil service that is able to serve the government regardless of the party in power.

She suggested that the government probably signed such a contract to move faster instead of having to put out a new tender each time. "It's a complicated process," she concluded.
The MP for Beauport–Limoilou tried to find out how much this 81-year contract would cost taxpayers. The senior policy advisor for the Treasury Board, Sean Boots, was cut off by the committee chair before he could answer and will have to send his response in writing.

Transparency issue

The president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union representing 72,000 members, has sounded the alarm. "The government has been relying on expensive outsourcing for years," said its president, Jennifer Carr. "McKinsey is just the most recent example."

She said such outsourcing jeopardizes the security of government computer systems, is less transparent and undermines accountability.

Conservatives have pointed to the consulting firm's ties to the opioid crisis. The firm has also been ordered to pay nearly $600 million to 47 U.S. states for helping pharmaceutical companies

> >Blunt questions about their product

Like what? "Your product is marketed as providing XYZ value and efficiencies to your customers, do you have any data to back that up?"


A lot of times newbies, when trying to be useful, are critical of things thinking that they're helping to uncover problems that have gone under the radar. They haven't learned that the business world is full of bullshit and if something even kind of works the way it was marketed, that's a pretty decent product. I also think newbies frequently get critiqued, so they might implicitly feel that that's how to be useful. Wrong, in the business world shit rolls down hill. Everyone else gets to shit on you (not everyone chooses to) and you'll have to wait your turn until you get some underlings. 

All companies are bullshitting about the flavor of the month buzzwords. Right now it's AI, one point in time it was "Smart <insert object>" . Nike made fucking smart shoes ffs. It doesn't matter if something is actually AI, it doesn't if a device is actually "smart." What matters is that consumers are willing to purchase your products and services and are more or less happy enough to stay a customer. And that's why Nike made a $350 pair of shoes that can tie its own laces from an app.


To answer the last point in your post, consulting firms only win work when they present a proposal that a customer likes. This essentially means that you're going to do whatever the customer wants you to do, not cover all the bases. That would be expensive and a waste of time.

> I didn’t downvote, I was asleep as another poster implied. 
Yeah - read it recently. 

I know people that worked on a few of the projects in this book (ie healthcare.gov is the big one) and what they’ve had to say flies in the face of what she describes. 

So her main issue that I sorta agree with is with public sector consultants that take the place of org continuity, but that’s entirely an organization’s decision to cede that function to external entities. 

Public sector consulting has this problem with doing a lot of actual work for the organization for them, and you often wonder what the actual client does themselves. I’ve only done a few public sector projects myself back in my consulting days so I can’t really answer that in-depth- she may have a valid point there.

But here is where I lose faith in what she has to say:
Everything else in here is an… insincere interpretation, to put it lightly. 

For context; I was a consultant at a tier 2 for many years and when I was a junior I too thought the work was superfluous. It’s easy to see someone with limited perspective agreeing with her, I would have too.

Now I’m in industry, on the client side, and I hire consultancies (boutique, MBB, etc) regularly to tackle extreme problems, socialize and elevate issues, and save my org a ton of time. 

That is why organizations hire consultants. Expensive? Yes. Can we do it ourselves? Yes.
But we save 6-8 months for hiring a 2-3 week engagement.
To come out and say that’s not a genuine service for any org is ridiculous.

> Look, I’ll give you an honest answer but hoping you’re not an AH just trying to mess with your coworker. 

I’m from and currently live in Mexico. Let’s talk about the weather first, depending on the neighborhood (yes, that specific) your teammate could have super heavy rain or just a drizzle, even if the weather just says raining. If there are thunderstorms then thing will get more complicated. Now, also take into consideration that some states are having mayor heatwaves so that is affecting the power towers hence any service that relies on electricity to operate, in case you hear this next, it is true. If your are sus a quick google search for the weather can clarify this, heat above 100 \~ 105 F or heavy rain stated in the report then you know its a possibility, if it’s says sunny all week then…

Now regarding the internet, it depends on the zone (state + however the internet provider has divided the comercial areas) and the internet provider how it will be affected by the rain. For example, if your teammate lives in a new neighborhood, even if it’s in a big city like CDMX, Guadalajara or Monterrey, they’ll probably be more susceptible to failures as well if they live in an established area in a small town. Also, light rain makes drivers bold so there are a lot more accidents and if someone crashes and hits a tower, it will affect the service for the whole zone.

Connecting into their phone can get really expensive depending on the internet plan they have,  so I suggest avoid making this request unless their phone is business expense (meaning their employer is paying for it).  

Hope it helps!

Manage your clients, matters, and money with Clio and Quickbooks. Hire a professional bookkeeper to get you on the right path and to balance your books once a month. Ours works by transaction ($x/250 transactions). Consider flat rate billing ($x for complaint, summons, svc of process, $y for interlocutory motions, $z for discovery, etc) in stages for your litigation. This saves tracking billing which is just one less thing to worry about.

> Not for me.  I worked harder and made less.  Even more work was not billable, and I couldn’t justifiably bill at my prior firm rate ($100/hr less).  Plus, I had significantly more expenses (office, malpractice insurance, internet, Lexis, billing system, CPA, taxes, Ruby virtual receptionist, LawPay, CLEs and memberships, bar dues, computer and printer/copier systems, website design and hosting, advertising, and a coverage attorney contractor for hearings that conflicted or for assistance when I was swamped).  Plus, I had a wider range of less reliable clients that resulted in a reduced collection rate and more time and effort to be paid fully.  Also, my personal health insurance, dental insurance, eye insurance, 401k retirement savings, paid vacation, and other benefits were gone.  It wasn’t easy and resulted in a net about $20k less than I made at the firm and no vacation, which was fine for me until I got married and had a child.  Some years were better and I made more than at the firm, but never more than 10-15% more and always with way more hassle.  #freedom

For automation:   voicemail, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) etc are just an evolution of technologies. So, the next would be AI Receptionist. 

You can experience AI to make your own decision.  e.g you can try [Rosie](http://heyrosie.com/?ref=rddt) AI receptionist service. They offer 7 days free trial. It’s worth seeing what today’s technology is capable of.

The AI agent answers calls like a human using natural language. You can train the agent using your website, FAQ, or database so it understands your business. It is very interesting and affordable to start; the basic functions cost about $49 with no call time limits. Full recording and transcripts will be sent to you by email or sms. Never miss a call. 

For some people, it's hard to believe they are talking/working with AI robot. It's just too new to be accepted. It's similar to many people don't like IVR or those Press 1 for... Press 2 for... system..

> Great breakdown! Your data on the plumbing business saving $4,300/month really resonates with what we've seen in the field.

I've found a few additional patterns worth sharing:

1. Warm transfers are critical - the biggest complaint from users isn't that they're talking to AI, but that they have to repeat themselves when transferred to a human. We built a transcript handoff that solved this.

2. Voice quality matters less than latency. People forgive robotic voices but hate waiting 2-3 seconds for responses. We got ours down to <20ms and saw satisfaction jump 40%.

3. Double-booking is a silent killer in appointment flows. Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).

4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list. We implemented an AI receptionist for a home care provider that automated their 20-minute intake process, saving $200-300k annually. The elderly clients actually preferred it because it never rushed them.

Have you looked at legal intake at all? We're seeing law firms with massive ROI on qualification.

> I would say do take the opportunity to learn from the system and rise in the company if you can.  


My simple suggestion would be to help the owners understand that what they're doing is smart for reasons people mention below (tracking and training and quality assurance) but your concerns are valid the risk of the lack of empathy can lead to bad reviews and complaints -- which is something you sound like you care about.  


I have been in both positions (a business manager, and someone who worked phones in entry level positions and reception roles) so usually the "script" will evolve for hundreds of unanticipated scenarios as well as unhinged people, and it will take someone with experience and empathy to drive the impmementation (even if through AI). 


Alternatively, if you're looking for a new opportunity don't put your previous owner on blast in the legal community -- simply focus on your strengths as many people are looking to hire intake coordinators.  


That being said if youre able to assimilate AI intake (and high quality tracking) into your skillset, you'll be more valuable to many law firm business managers.

### Charge More
Charging more is the easiest way to make more money. As long as they're still reasonable and within ethics boundaries.

Increase rates as you can justify it and do so regularly.

### Sell More Times
Can you sell more things to people? Simple divorce, sure. Now what about name changes, new power of attorney documents, etc.

Bank future goodwill from referral partners by referring them to an estate lawyer, financial planning referral, etc.

## Reducing Costs
There are two main ways to reduce costs:

1. Get clients for less (i.e., reduce CAC)
2. Get results for less (i.e., reduce COS)

### Reducing CAC
The best way to reduce CAC for most firms (especially solo lawyers) is to get better at sales (reducing Sales CAC). As I mentioned before, being more available, taking more calls, doing it faster, and following up more are the keys here.

You spend all this money on getting leads, don’t let them go to waste by not doing everything you can to close them.

Keep increasing this until you:

- Have 16h of coverage minimum. You can always scale it back if you need. But it's not hard when texting is an option.
- Follow up with leads within 5 minutes of them first contacting you. It doesn't have to be you. You can hire and train anyone to do this. Again, it's not hard when you have a single number people can text and anyone can respond to.

**Tip:** Develop a script for closing. You can't give legal advice until they hire you. Someone else can qualify them before you close them. If you need help with this, DM me.

**Reducing Marketing CAC**
There's a ton of ways to do this. It's more of a diagnosis process of figuring out where waste/opportunity exists.

Here's how I think about it in terms of ad spend:

- How much did I spend on paid media?
- How many people saw my ad (Impressions)?
- How many people contacted me (leads)?
- How many people contacted me that were qualified?

With those numbers you can calculate your Cost per Impression, Cost per Lead, and Cost per Qualified Lead.

If one of them is a bottleneck, then you can investigate deeper.

Bunch of people seeing your ad (impressions) but no one's contacting you? Then figure out why.

Are they seeing them but not clicking to your site?

That's probably a targeting problem. Make sure the right people seeing them? e.g., let's say you're doing Google Ads, are you bidding on the right keywords, in the right geographies, at the right times? If so, is the ad copy good or generic?

If people are clicking the ads but not contacting you, then make sure nothing's broken with the page or contact method. Then, make sure your page is convincing? Are you talking like a lawyer or a person? The copy matters more than the design.

Speak to them problem. Make them feel understood. Answer the questions in advance with the page. Don't be lazy, add video. You don’t need high production here. People just want to hire someone who's real and they can relate to.

Making it easy helps too.

> What you are describing (at least to me) does not sound like a CRM exactly, more like a practice management tool (and there are MANY). I feel like most tools are geared towards PI (bigger money, larger firms, etc) so you will have plenty of options.

When I think of a CRM tool, I think about that as being something working hand-in-hand with marketing, following up on leads, prospective clients, doing follow up to book consultations (also sending reminders of upcoming appointments) and then taking the lead to "client" status.

I have used a few different tools trying to find the one that worked for me (high-volume solo criminal in Chicago). I tried Clio (hated how many steps I needed to go through to create files and a discovery soldering system which did not appear to have been fixed some three years after I left them) and Clio is about as big a name in the industry as there is. They were huge on being early adopters of integrations with other tools (something I tip my cap to). I then went to Smokeball, which I liked a lot, but at the time didn't have a Mac option, no application for my phone, limited integrations (I see now far more integrations which is great). I then moved to MyCase which was quite good and the recommendation I would make for most people. Certain levels of customization to make it your own, all the tools I would trust firms would need, PC/Mac applications and plugins, they really upped their integrations up as well. What I ran into as an issue was they had a data size cap for individual files (1GB) I routinely have files that go above that and I was stuck uploading to a Google Drive for random large files rather than having my complete file together.

I am currently with Filevine which is the most daunting, but also most customizable option there is. There are upfront costs with them that arent required with other such software, but you really can make it "your own" from layout to what sections are called and what order things appear (along with required data to be entered, etc.) but it can take serious time and not insignificant money (2,500-5000 id suspect) to get you off the ground on top of the fees for the base software itself. I do love it and continue to learn and hone the software further for document automation, AI tools that Filevine I feel is at the forefront with, etc.

For true "CRM" as I defined above, there are many of companies that offer similar tools, for a more legal focused version: Lawmatics, LeadDocket, LawRuler. I used the first two. There are companies that then white label Go High Level as a CRM tool (LawHustle as an example). I ended up going to Go HIgh Level and finding a guy through Fiverr who had GHL experience to build out my own tool, with my own workflows while not having to pay a different company a monthly premium to use the tool I can get to on my own. I am VERY excited about how the tool will work for following up with leads via email, text, voicemails, an AI Chatbot coached on my website an

> Agreed. I hate clio. In button vLex and FastCase methinks clio can only fuck it up given my terrible experience with clio. 

I’ve posted this on other threads and repost here because the same questions come up. So here’s my experience with Clio for five years and Leap since January 2025.

I’ve used clio for 5 years and become more frustrated with it everyday. I’d had high hopes early on and did deep dives on automation training and everything possible to leverage technology.

But.... Clio document automation is cumbersome and tedious. Tech support gives me contradictory advice from one call to the next. I had to create hundreds of custom fields to track basic data for automation and clio doesn’t let you sort them. Everytime i want to accomplish something easy I'm prompted to buy a subscription app.

Clio is a barely glorified Outlook / Microsoft Business abortion of a piece of Crap software platform.

And clio grow is even worse.

I even paid a consultant $3,000 to help me automate my probate practice. Money wasted.

I signed on with Leap because Wealth Counsel is packaged with Leap for a total price of $200/month per seat. 

I was very wary given my experience with clio.

But...

... I’m continually impressed with Leap. Document automation is so much easier with Leap than it was with Clio.

For various practice areas Leap has pre-programmed tables to ID and connect everybody associated with the matter. For estate planning, for instance, Leap features prompts for you to fill in all family members, all heirs, all devisees, all assets of various types, all executors, all agents,...

Then you click a button and it imports all that data into wealth counsel, where you complete the interview and create the estate plan as you normally would with wealth counsel.

So far, i have not had to create many custom fields in Leap. In clio i would have to have created dozens or hundreds of custom fields by now.

I created a deed template recently for up to four grantors and two properties. Took me about one hour.

You can even create a replicating table that enables you to program one row in a table and it will automatically create unlimited rows. So if you've got 10 heirs you program one row with the data you need to track for each heir. Then you can get the merge field data for each heir imported directly into the document you need to create.

In clio you have no such option to create replicating rows, so I’d have to build a form with a custom field for each separate item. Grantor 1, Grantor 2, Grantor 3... . And then custom fields to describe each person and their ownership interest.

So for a probate Estate in clio i’d have to build out a form with up to 20 heirs, 20 devisees, 20 creditors, with additional custom field sets for each of those 60 items. Overbuild early just in case you someday have an estate with dead heirs and lots of per stirpes fractionated shares.

In Leap i just right click on the prompt for Heir, add as many heirs as i have with contact a

> Very interesting insight. I have found that setting the right expectations in the sales capacity can be super hard for an ai agent to do with high accuracy, which may not directly affect closing rates, but may increase churn with clients down road. I personally work with agencies which is an industry that is a lot different in terms of fulfillment and such, so it makes sense than the SaaS space is a bit different in how they prefer to buy. I have been seeing a lot of large SaaS companies implement AI customer service and I know personally that I absolutely hate trying to talk to an ai about issues instead of a real human, but the cost-benefit seems to outweigh the overhead of having call centers. I honestly think in the next 15-20 years that having a real person answer the phone will make any company stand out.

> Maximumlawyer: I'm not a regular listener, but I was thinking through intake processes and those episodes were pretty good.

[Smith.ai](https://Smith.ai): You have to keep your instructions and process simple enough that anyone can follow instructions. This is because any one of their employees might answer the phone, and they'll be looking at your instructions on a screen when they do so. 

They will schedule on a calendar of your choice, or integrate with Clio for intake. They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!

I've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.

So far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.

### r/VOIP — 2025-07-03 | 1pts | `general`

> I find your reply interesting. As a NE, you should know that bandwidth is a very minor concern for VOIP. The bigger concern is Latency and Jitter. I have Voip running on25/25 fiber with 0 issues and running on 1Gbps/50Mbps cable with call quality and drop issues all the time.   


One of the often overlooked aspects of Voip is QoS. If your router/security appliance supports it, this will have a significantly greater net effect on call quality then having a 10Gbps bandwidth that has lots of jitter/latency

  
From GPT (I know the answer, just used GPT for structure of my post)

✅ **Bandwidth is rarely the bottleneck anymore**  
VoIP requires very little bandwidth per call (usually **64-100 kbps per call** even with uncompressed codecs; compressed codecs like G.729 or Opus can use as little as **8-24 kbps**). Most modern broadband or even cellular networks have orders of magnitude more bandwidth than VoIP needs.

⚠️ **Latency, jitter, and packet loss are the real concerns**

* **Latency**: Delay above \~150ms starts to feel awkward in conversations.
* **Jitter**: Variation in packet arrival times causes choppy or robotic sound unless the jitter buffer compensates.
* **Packet Loss**: Even 1-2% packet loss can severely impact call quality.

So:

* Bandwidth *does matter* if you’re on a congested network (e.g., oversaturated home Wi-Fi during Netflix + gaming).
* But for a properly designed business or even home network, **latency, jitter, and QoS (quality of service)** are the **real performance killers** for VoIP.

As someone who has deployed and manage dozens of Voip systems over the yeas, this is accurate.

> The main idea was for the IVR system to organise the callers and find out what they want - then either put them through to the right person or tell them they will receive a call back.

The answering service isn't doing its job, but it seems that if we want the best option, we would have to hire an actual receptionist to take calls, which is too expensive. 

It's whether people would rather talk to a human enough that the benefits of the robot are worth missing out on and the human error from the virtual receptionists are a pill we have to swallow.

> I automate tasks using code, notmake nor zapier (niche and type-agnostic). It gives me much more freedom for how I design a solution (especially if I'll work with 3rd party websites that don't have zapier integrations) and it's cheaper tbh. So I can automate any task as long as I understand it. Just as I did for my client, I first understood the tasks he wanted to automate (he literally did them in front of me in a cafe). He thought it was impossible to automate such tasks (they were very hard complex for a robot) but he wanted to try with me. On my way home, I started thinking of the frameworks and tools I'd use. I had the MVP running one month later and set up the whole pipeline (from his wooco api until the email is sent to his customers) start of september. I will deploy next week on aws (More details below for how his business is expected to go from 20k MRR to 100k MRR in about 6 months)

Also, I just automated a important task in my father's job. He usually spends 4 hrs every week repeating the same task 200 times !!! I almost got angry hearing that. It's torture. It's like the punishments we used to have in elementary school when we write a sentence 100 times. No human should do such tasks. His task was very simple, I finished the main script in 2 hours. I literally just showed him the demo and he'll talk to his boss tomorrow about it.

&#x200B;

More details on his case: Automation of admin tasks. The software was custom for his use case (he is a solo-preneur and he needed a LOT of time for order-fulfillment and customer support. He couldn't scale the business and was leaving a lot of money on the table. Having a virtual assistant presented security risks). I integrated my solution with his woocommerce account (used the wooco api), google sheets, an email service provider and another 3rd party website. He laughed so hard when I run the demo in front of him. He wants to scale for BFCM period. We are now talking about how we can make a chatbot (not like the ones that say non-sense, but an actual chatbot that understands and assists customers. Customer support is very important for his business and it can increase sales in a crazy way, literally just by answering 2-3 questions for a customer!!) I am now preparing the data to finetune gpt-4.

### r/consulting — 2025-05-06 | 37pts | `general`

> A consultant has 2 competing problems:

1. Nobody wants to hire an "expert" that knows less than them. As knowledge becomes more affordable and attainable in-house, the standard for what a consultant has to be gets raised. This is happening across all fields touched by AI, and consulting is not exempt. There will be more demands on experience, degrees, prestige and field alignment. Coming to an end are the days of promising to send in a SME, and some kid with 0 field experience shows up to try to BS some strategy slides in a few days.

2. The dunning-krueger threshold is also being lifted. People that barely understand a topic can have a discussion with an AI that sounds versed, and make the mistake of thinking this equates to having good in-house knowledge. People without skills can't assess skills, so they are stuck thinking that mediocre is good, and won't be able to tell the difference between 5/10 strategy from a bot or the usual 7/10 strategy that come out of consulting. This causes a crisis of communication, in which real SMEs have to work harder to help the lower end of the curve understand that they are screwing up by listening to a low-competence bot. Historically, this is a losing battle, as in the previous iteration, the consulting industry did the same thing by claiming to be the SMEs, to cut out the real SMEs and convince clients to give them the money instead. Now the bots are going to do that to consultants.

The answer is that the world is a competition, and now the robots have raised the standard. Consultants that want to survive need to get better. Deliver better quality, and communicate more effectively about the difference in quality against the robot. Focus on domains where AI is weakest, and also present a hybrid approach in which AI advancements are integrating into the consulting service yet guided by expert hands.

> For standard business needs, Microsoft Azure APIs are sandboxed by default. What you upload to an AI via Azure only exists on their servers for the duration of the interaction. The Azure version of the AIs are not in the OpenAI space, are not used for teaching AI, and do not report back to OpenAI in any way. 

What I tell my clients is that we use this sandboxed Azure setup when working with identifiable or proprietary business information. There's no aspects of this that exposes the client's data to others or the AI itself. With Azure, we are leasing robot brainpower inside a closed loop. We could build our own AI in-house using open source like Llama, but Azure already offers security while providing state-of-the-art robot power.

Azure also has higher security services for people that need it. I believe they have a solution to install the AI directly in your building so you have full control and visibility to confirm the data is not leaving your walls. That costs more, but it serves the purpose for people dealing with classified stuff or needing to answer to stringent security standards. But the regular API already works this way.

> RE: OpenAI o3

The current stage is a proof of concept, but it's a real threat because OpenAI has a pedigree of improving performance at lighting speeds. For instance, the distance between GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini was about 14 months, and in that time they reduced resource utilization by like 14X (going by API costs) while maintaining benchmarks and adding features.

In general terms, think of our current stage of AI as 3 components. The pre-processing, the LLM stage, and the controller or post-processing. In the pre-processing, the system understands the prompt and can doctor it and direct it to various modules to service it. For instance, if you ask a math question, the pre-processor can pull out a calculator so the LLM doesn't have to do math. If you ask a particularly difficult question, the system can pull out Python and write itself an algorithm to solve it beyond what a normal calculator could handle. You usually don't see this stuff, it happens in the background.

The LLM stage (the actual language brain) is what we are saying is fairly close to max ability for now. We already fed the architecture all of the world's knowledge and spent years maximizing optimizations. So the current version of GPT-4o, by my guess, is perhaps \~80% as smart at doing language responses as we are going to get without a significant tech breakthrough... for now as of 2024-early 2025.

The controller or post-processing stage has tons of promise. In addition to using the pre-processor to help digest the prompt and introduce fancy modules to crunch data, the controller can run parallel processes to hack at a problem from multiple angles. We know from various tests that an LLM responds better if it has multiple chances at the same question. I've seen research that shows that a low-smarts LLM can answer as well as a smart one if it is allowed to refine its own answer 100 times in the background.

What the o1 and o3 models are doing is taking advantage of this controller / post-processing approach. They are using their smartest model, and then it tries to improve on its own answers by pursuing various iterations. The underlying LLM is still near some form of GPT-4o, but the result you get comes from multiple versions of itself trying to digest the question from multiple angles and then forming a roundtable of copies of the same robot to analyze everything the robot can do to try to come up with a perfect answer.

OpenAI proved with o3 that if you let the machine eat as many resources as it wants, it gets within range of passing the current AGI tests we have available. This doesn't mean that o3 is AGI, it means that our tests were not expecting the robots to get this smart so fast; and we need new tests that are harder and more precise in what they check for. 

o3 is still missing proper self-learning and memory systems. OpenAI is for sure working on this stuff but it's not ready yet. But systems like o3 (the proof of concept), or o1 (the current smartest robot available

> For almost any task, you can either pay someone to take it off your hands, or automate it.

Whether you can do so ethically, affordably, and maintaining sufficient quality, is a different matter.

I think practice management software like smokeball, mycase, PracticePanther and Clio Manage are absolutely worth the price just for the organization alone, and they include extra quality of life like escrow management, electronic signature, automated workflow, and document automation.  How much benefit you get depends on how much effort you put into setting it up and making sure you use it properly

Depending on your field, there may be dedicated drafting software.  Do not use AI drafting, there’s too big a chance of having mistakes, missing something important, or generating a hallucinations - not to mention issues regarding client confidentiality; do not ever put in identifying information.  You can use AI to help create an outline or rewrite a paragraph, but treat it as a dishonest college student who would rather make things up, and will insist on being right even if it’s wrong.

Then there’s CRM like Lawmatics and Clio Grow.  This helps manage your marketing and client intake.  But it still requires time and effort on your part, and might not help you all that much.  

A paralegal can do a lot of grunt work, and if you don’t want to commit to a full time employee, you can hire a virtual paralegal (paid by the hour)

You can get a receptionist, a chatbot, or an answering service to answer calls and/or chats on your website.  The quality will never be the same as what you can deliver

Bookkeeping you can and probably should get software, but that still takes up a lot of time.  The best thing you can do is hire an actual bookkeeper, they’re cheap enough.

It is possible to create a fully automated process where a client fills out a form or questionnaire online and documents are automatically created.  That has two drawbacks: (1) your client doesn’t see the difference between you and legalzoom or rocketlawyer and they’ll wonder why they’re paying you.  (2) your clients will make mistakes in entering their information, and may select the wrong options if you let them.  I won’t do it, people pay me a premium price for a premium service and I want to make sure it’s done right

What is your drop rate and SOA rate? 

I work as an AI engineer at a decent size PI law firm and I often look at those stats alongside the ones you mentioned. I solved the issue you stated above by just having a receptionist and intake team separate and available at all times, which is similar advice to what you have received above. I recommend a BPO with strong American accents though...

But a lot of big law firms also struggle with SOAs and catching them in advanced before it's too late.. so for your current clients, what are their stats? Are they getting every call answered? Do you have any attrition that happens in the later stages or not really? At your size I'm curious to if you have those issues or not..

I went there twice in one year, so I got rid of that and solely WFH unless I’m in court, which I am every day. I think at this point I’m too cheap to pay someone and if they call my cell phone, I just let it go to VM until I’m ready to answer about ten calls at once. I always did my own calendaring and wouldn’t let anyone touch that. Honestly I love the freedom.

> Receptionist - overseas remote worker. All calls with OC/clients needs to be scheduled (we use zoom for phones). I don't drop what I'm doing to answer calls (unless there's an emergency).

If the call is from a potential new client, reception routes to Intake, another overseas position.

If new client is qualified, Intake schedules call with salesperson. We use Clio Grow for new clients, but it sucks and I wouldn't recommend it.

Via Clio Grow, new client gets series of emails reminding of appointment, letting them know what to expect ect.

Salesperson uses clio grow to draft template agreement. Clio manage captures payment.

Case is converted to Clio manager where we open template file.

I use notion to outline, step by step, sometimes in painful detail, who does what when for every time of project we might be working on (okay, not every project, I'm still working on it).

Every month, legal team uses chatGPT to send client monthly email update. This is as much for me as the team -- I compare month over month to see if case is moving forward.

Case ends with formal closing procedures.

  
OP, the actual software you use does not matter. That's the least important part. Attorneys will argue forever about what software is "best." The reality is that they are all a shit sandwich. You just need to decide which shit sandwich tastes less shitty than the rest.

The KEY to running a successful, well-run, profitbale business is having SYSTEMS in place and holding the team accountable to those systems. You can write the systems on a napkin and copy them for the team. It doesn't matter. It just needs to be written down and you need to hold the team accountable to those systems you design.

> I didn’t have malpractice insurance for the first couple years and it was fine. (Not required by my state bar although I did have to disclose to clients that I didn’t have it.) Now I have it but haven’t had to use it, knock on wood. 

I don’t use practice management software. I tried MyCase but it was way too expensive and I hated having all my files depend on a third party. So I just use Google Drive and Google Sheets to keep track of everything. 

I have a part time assistant who is in the Philippines and super cheap. She keeps track of my cases on Sheets. Whenever anything is emailed she saves it to the file and updates the status of that client’s case on the Sheet and updates my calendar with what to do next and when. I’m also training her on drafting things for me like EEOC charges and Complaints for my lawsuits etc. I try to rely on her for as much as possible so I don’t have to do as much admin work. 

I need someone to answer the phone (my assistant is asleep during office hours due to the time difference and her spoken English isn’t great compared to her written English) but it hasn’t been an expense I’ve felt like investing in yet because I don’t get THAT many phone calls. Most of my clients text or email so my assistant handles communicating with them about administrative stuff or status that way and then I call them to discuss whatever comes up in their case. She sets up the calls for me and I try to only work part time so she knows my windows of availability. 

Sometimes my husband, who is also my tech/website guy because he’s a software developer by profession, acts as my assistant in terms of calling back clients, meeting them when they want to drop off documents or payments (otherwise I work almost completely remotely which is good because we like to travel and I sometimes have our four kids at home with me when I work etc.) or helping them navigate scanning and sending things to me if they’re older or computer illiterate. 

At some point it would be nice to have an in-person receptionist but I want to hold off on big payroll expenses like that until/unless they’re absolutely necessary.

> Start by reaching out directly to small law firms in your area - cold calling and dropping off resumes in person can actually work really well in the legal field, especially for entry-level positions like file clerk, receptionist, or legal assistant. Many small firms don't bother posting jobs online because they prefer word-of-mouth or direct approaches. Your criminal justice background is definitely relevant, so highlight that in your resume and cover letter. While you're at it, check if your school has any internship programs with local firms, reach out to your criminal justice professors for contacts (they often know local attorneys), and consider joining your local bar association as a student member - they usually have job boards and networking events where you can meet attorneys looking for help. The legal world is still pretty old-school when it comes to networking and hiring, so don't be afraid to put yourself out there in person.

> This is why I say I work remotely at home and only have office hours by appointment only. Sometimes I’m actually working at my office. But no one can just walk in or drop in. It’s an executive suite with a keypad that people need to know the password to get in. No one knows my password except for me and my husband (who sometimes acts like my assistant).   I have had people call and say they’re at my office and they need to drop off paperwork for me to look at etc and they aren’t even clients - I’ve never even heard of them before. I dealt with this problem but hiring a text service that responds to customer inquiries from my website or text with an invitation to schedule a paid consult. I also want to hire some kind of remote or virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but I don’t have this yet. I usually just text them after they leave a voicemail and tell them all potential client inquiries are handled via text. Then when they text me back my text service takes it from there.   I have 4 kids and 7 pets and a lot of hobbies. I take weightlifting classes and teach Zumba classes for my physical and mental health. I also have plenty of clients I’m working for already. I’m not giving up more than two minutes of my time to anyone else for free. It takes me two minutes to text potential clients who call and tell them to text instead. If they don’t want to follow my system and book a paid consult via text then I don’t want to have to talk to them and I certainly don’t want to have to see them at my office in person!

> Look, I get it, I fought hard to be almost fully remote, but you are way off base in some practice areas.

>Calls can be forwarded to their home office

Yeah, but they can't forward calls to other extensions at the firm, and calls from other extensions can't be forwarded to them. This is a primary function for some support staff.

>mail can be picked up

I said deliveries. There are deliveries from clients and counsel all the time, some of which need to be signed for. Clients also drop things off periodically, and they will take a firm more seriously if they have someone at the desk full time. Fair or not.

>USPS offers informed delivery, so you know when a package arrives

So what, is the remote admin going to drive to the office to safeguard the hard drive of client files sitting outside the door? Things being delivered sometimes need to be processed in a timely manner. An extra day to handle something doesn't sound like much until your calendar is jammed.

>printers cost $300 for home office

Depending on your practice area, you might need a real office printer. Scan to email is much faster when you don't have to reload 50 pages at a time into a $300 POS printer, because the way more expensive/capable office printer is collecting dust in the filing room.

>Maybe you need a part time receptionist, but probably not more.

One of the things you didn't mention is that clients and prospective clients will take you more seriously if you have a full time office presence. These people are usually going through something stressful, and little things like that make them have morre confidence in you as a professional. That is just the reality.

> I'd be surprised if this existed on any system out of the box. It would be possible to build, but it wouldn't be trivial.

Many VOIP systems allow calls to certain areas and only require a PIN for calls to other areas. For instance, local calls would be free, and international calls would require a PIN. 

Otherwise, if calls are especially rare, you could have the Supervisor initiate a call to the receptionist, call the external number, join the calls, and drop.

I know Asterisk has a way to trigger scripts on outbound calls. You could write an app that triggers when a call is made, pushes a notification to a cell phone, and completes.the call if it's authorized. You could hire someone to build something like this for you

Yealink - we would never recommend these anymore. Phones freeze, have FW issues, get ghost calls from sip port scans esp impacting work from home users behind home routers. Yealink phones get the most user complaints- recently we converted an office from T4 series phones to Cisco 8800 series, the receptionist hugged the installer tech and said "thank god" before drop kicking her t43 across the floor.

Anyone who thinks Yealink is a real option vs Cisco, Poly, Mitel (if you're on ringcentral) is not someone who has ever spent much time using any Yealink product.

### r/agency — 2025-02-20 | 1pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> **Where would you look for businesses that can afford $1,500-$2,500+ per month?** 

Research to find niches where these rates are the norm - especially in a recurring revenue model. With a little digging about avg. marketing budgets by industry, you could likely identify a handful worth researching further. From there, find a grouping of top agencies providing your same services in those industries to find a general idea of what they charge for your same set of services. Also, try and identify those agencies sales proposition. What can you do to differentiate yourself from the crowd? 

**Where would you approach them?**

I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of clients in person. Drop off info at their office and try and get a business card or set up a meeting. Meet them at conferences and do some networking. 

I am sure cold calling and cold emailing can work in some circumstances, but higher paying clients are going to want premium services and will be leery of what might appear to be fly by night companies. Position and brand yourself as a premium service and option. 

Lastly, offer to provide some value add upfront. Business owners and operators tend to be highly competitive people. Offer to do a comparison between their website and marketing vs. their top 3 competitors and bring the results, in person, to discuss in a presentation. Bring contracts and proposals and budget suggestions. Bring a grid of a comparison of your services and pricing vs. competitors in their industry. Bring case studies of your success. Bring referral information. 

  
**What strategies would you use to break through our current plateau?**

Networking. Again, I cannot stress enough the advantage of being in front of someone in person. Go to conferences, go to local business meetups and groups, go to events where business owners and marketing people are likely to be. Drop off your materials and card at someone's office or building, be nice to the gatekeeper (receptionist, front desk, etc.) and get the name of the best person to contact about marketing.  

Talk to people at conferences and local meetups. Find local business groups that might let you do a presentation on marketing strategies. 

It's significantly easier to introduce yourself to someone, get a meeting with someone, setup a pitch call, etc. in person vs. over email, the phone, or a Zoom call.

### r/Dentistry — 2024-12-01 | 2pts | `general`

> I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.

From what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.

Any sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.

Another hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.

If anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.

AI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.

### r/Dentistry — 2024-11-17 | 1pts | `pricing`

> To be 100% transparent before anyone reads this, I am building a product just like.  
AI answering services can definitely be worth it, and I'll explain why:

Right now I'm working with a practice that expressed some interest. We're expecting huge revenue growth just from after-hours and unanswered calls. Why? Because they serve geriatrics almost exclusively. Senior citizens don't want to text. They just want to talk.

Typically, a practice like this will pay several dollars a minute for a virtual receptionist that's handling calls for multiple businesses. They can easily make mistakes, and of course leave a bad impression because who cares? They're not a real employee of yours.

And that's not to mention how most practices don't even account for working hours when their receptionist is on the phone. The practice I mentioned earlier showed me how they MISSED 30 calls DURING working hours. That's just within the hours of 9-5. They're doing high-ticket procedures (thousands of dollars). That's a lot of money being left on the table. This is the definition of hidden revenue that most practices don't realize they're missing out usually because they don't track this type of stuff or just sweep it under the rug as nothing.

You take a product like the one I've built -- integrates with your PMS to book appts, look up and create patients, can work with a human in the loop for extra safety.. it'll do everything a regular person can plus more with the unanswered calls, 24/7, at literally 5-10x less the COST. It can pick up the phone after-hours or if your receptionist is busy on the phone with another office or insurance after it goes through a couple rings.

Is it perfect? No. Is it good enough to help a practice make more money and does it have the potential to get better? BIG Yes. 

Just like a typical receptionist, it can make a mistake from time to time. Maybe misspell a name, have a hard time understanding a heavy accent.. but it's a lot better than I think most people realize.

More than happy to give someone a chance to call one that I've setup if they want to see what I'm talking about. Feel free to DM.

### r/legaltech — 2025-01-27 | 4pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> Viable pricing and a lack of feedback loops. 

First, pricing: I spoke about it over in eDiscovery subreddit, but my goodness do these legal tech companies have no clue how to package and price these services yet. 

I've had half a dozen prospective AI clients kill their requests after hearing how billing will work, and all the rules/caveats. 

Per document at $0.90?? What is this, OCR in 1998? 

Install a package for $1,500/month on a 1GB matter???

Locked in for X-number of months minimum?

No trial periods for them to dip their toes in?

Come on... people are anxious, unsure of the viability, and unsure of the $ justification to their client and these AI providers are telling them to kick sand. They WANT to give it a try, but aren't being given the chance. 

Then the other aspect is lack of feedback loops. This is making it harder to use certain software, because there isn't a place to input AND STORE facts about the case that the AI model can continue to leverage in all assessments. There's of course prompt-based workflows where you're supposed to self-contain all of the information in the prompt, but even that has it's limits. Rel aiR for Privilege is doing better in this area, but not perfect.

Give us a separate place where we can simply say "this guy is the CEO" or "That person quit on \_\_\_\_" or "This phone call regarding \_\_\_ happened offline so there's no record of it in the data". Aka: Assumed/known facts that might not be clear from the data itself.

> Since it’s obvious from my username and background, I’ll just be upfront—I’m with ClearlyIP, and we do have a device in this space. Not trying to pitch it, but since there’s a lot of noise around “POTS replacement” and some questionable solutions floating around, I’ll explain what we built and why.

A lot of what’s being pushed on the market right now is either:

* A glorified ATA with 4G fallback (dial tone only, no real SIP intelligence), or
* Devices that rely entirely on cloud registration and fail when the Internet goes out or the provider is unreachable.

What we built is a **VoIP Failover Gateway** that acts as:

* A local SIP registrar: Phones (IP or analog) can dual-register to both your primary PBX and this gateway.
* A SIP trunk endpoint: If the PBX goes down, it can route calls out over its own SIP trunks via built-in 4G (using our private APN).
* A local call manager: During a failover, it can still handle intercom, IVRs, ring groups, etc. So, phones on-site still work with each other and can call out.
* POTS line replacement: Has 6 FXS ports for elevator panels, fire alarms, security lines, etc. with proper support for inbound testing.
* Has 2 FXO ports with a relay that switches those to the first two FXS ports, so you can use them as a last chance all else fails routing of the two FXS lines to external FXO lines in the event you have a power outage.
* Power options: Has battery backup options and pass-through for fire panel power.

It’s not trying to fail over the whole WAN or spoof POTS—it’s focused on **voice continuity** in scenarios where either the PBX or the Internet dies, and it actually handles real SIP call flows instead of just providing tone.

We priced it to be usable too—$40/month including LTE service if you don’t want to buy it outright.

If anyone wants to see a more technical overview (no fluff, mostly demo), this webinar breaks it down pretty well:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjPlCY4Al3M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjPlCY4Al3M)

Happy to answer questions here if anyone’s evaluating stuff in this space or just curious how we handled it.  We are always interested in hearing different use cases, and feature request to improve or add to our solutions as well.

> Sinch is a wholesale upstream provider resellers. They usually pretty easy to work with. I’ve worked with customers whose resellers were not helpful because they were losing the customers business.

Google Voice is tough because their support is very limited. You can try contacting Sinch directly and explaining the situation at one of the numbers listed on their site.

https://sinch.com/help-center/

I would echo the previous comments about a SnapBack. Most carriers don’t like to do it because it’s expensive ($350 per number for our cost as a carrier, $400-500 is what we charge the customer). Your other option would be an expedited port which typically takes 24-72 hours and costs the provider around $125-150.

You should also know that ports don’t happen on the weekend or any major holiday. I would suspect they could get this sorted by Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.

To be clear there is absolutely no technical reason for the number to be out of service for six weeks for porting. Ever. It usually takes 10-60 minutes for the routing to update when the porting is activated.  It sounds like that’s been done and your carrier just needs to program it in their switch. You can ask them what the FOC (firm order commitment) date is/was and they should be able to provide it. That’s the date agreed upon by the winning and losing carrier that the number will be ported. Most carriers will preprogram the number in their switch prior to the FOC date to allow the service to be provisioned and outbound calling for testing. When the port is activated the only really change is to inbound routing.

> Yes that's a very simple setup and **shouldn't** cost you that much. calls come in to the front desk and they can transfer to the proper ext or place the call in park for someone else to answer. clients can also call in the directly to the ext by dialing the direct phone number (DID). 

My quote for a customer like this would be (assuming you're in the US):

Monthly cost:  
$15 for the main number  
$10 for each ext (each includes a phone number)  
$5 for analog faxing service (or eFaxing)

Setup cost:  
FREE number porting (should be free from any carrier)  
FREE SIP Phone provisioning    
FREE Mobile app for calling  
Yealink SIP phones are my preference they run about $120+ ea (Yealink T54W)  
Polycom are my second choice they run about $140+ ea (Polycom VVX 301 or VVX 411)  
Faxing ATA run about $30+ (Grandstream HT801 or HT802)

I would suggest a POE (power over ethernet) switch, you can get them fairly cheap on amazon, if not each phone will need a power supply they run about $15+ each. Some vendors on Amazon sell them with power included. We buy directly from voipsupply and pass on any discounts we get from them to customers. You can also buy the phone from voipsupply they are a good supplier and will help with any defected phones. The POE switch can be placed after modem/router provided by your ISP they are plug and play so no crazy setup or configuring.

You get all the normal features of a PBX, forwarding, transfer, caller ID etc. call recording, voicemail to email with transcribing, FREE CRM integrations if needed.

Optional features:  
IVR (Interactive Voice Response) this is so when people call in they can hear a prerecorded voice asking them to press a button to call an ext, group of exts or a dial by name. We hire professional voice actors avg cost is about $50-80 for the recordings.

Toll-Free numbers -$7  
Texting (SMS to app) - $5  
Texting (SMS to email) - $10  
Texting (SMS to UI) - $10  


All and all this shouldn't cost you more than $60 to $80 per month for an office of that size. even at our "full price", which we never charge, this setup would cost $85 per month. Id be MORE than happy to send you an official quote for our service, if anything you may be able to use it to get a cheaper price from someone else.

> > Can each phone have its own extension number for direct dialing? I assume that if one person is talking to a customer that has called in, another customer is still able to call the dial-in number and talk to someone else.

For sure, either direct phone numbers or extension numbers are very possible.  The answer to this question is somewhat provider-specific, but technically, inbound call routing can be configued any way you like.

> Other than the physical VOIP-capable phones, what do we need to support this?

A PoE (power over ethernet) switch would be helpful.  Every VoIP phone worth considering can be powered by PoE, so you only need to run one cable to your phone.  If you want your service to withstand brief power outages, you can place your fibre equipment and PoE switch on a UPS.

> Finally, we may need a physical fax machine; it sounds like that can be handled by a separate line and an ATA, is that correct?

If a physical fax machine is a critical requirement, make sure the service you choose supports two things: ECM (error correction) and T.38 (the fax standard).  Without these two things, you will surely notice performance issues.  Alternately, use an email-to-fax / fax-to-email service, forget the hardware, and save some paper.

Lastly, be prepared to replace your router.  The vast majority will work well with VoIP, so try it with what you have first, but there's the odd one that will flatly refuse.

Good luck with the project.  Let us know how it goes and if you have any more questions.

> If it was me I'd try it, good VoIP service is only $2.99/month so that's not a big investment to experiment.

One might guess it would be horrible (VoIP on Starlink) but oddly people seem to be doing it with little complaint.  But keep in mind you are switched to a new satellite approximately once every 4 minutes, so it's actually quite magical that it works at all for longer than a minute or two but oddly people have found it does.

I have 15 phones distributed all over my home and a separate two-story garage a couple of hundred feet away, many of them are programmed with buttons to instantly intercom key locations, it is so convenient and works great!

Whole setup costs $2.99/month recurring and $0.015/Minute for outgoing calls (takes a lot of talking to add up). Initially I used a small form factor PC that someone was throwing in the garbage and just installed FreePBX on it.

Interesting things I've done with it: I once loaned a Wifi connected phone to my next door neighbor for a couple of months (until he moved away), was easy to provision a separate number for his incoming/outgoing calls (extra $1.99/month, so little cost I didn't even bother requiring him to pay it). I still have an extension at an office 30 Kms away from my home via a nailed up VPN connection, super convenient to be able to "intercom" from the office. I also have an IVR so the SO's calls go to sets near her without disturbing me and people can call me without disturbing her. Also having your own 12 channel conference bridge at home is cool!

People think music on hold from home is freaky :) Got to love voice mail to email and of course answering your home phone from the vacation hotel in the Caribbean is also convenient (I just threw a VPN capable telephone set in the suitcase).

No end of providers offer SIP trunking at these sort of very low monthly fees.

Note: Most of my phones are of the good used very cheap variety, a mixture of Grandstream, Yealink, Snom, et. al.

With all the enhanced call handling features and conveniences, all of it costing next to nothing, I can't imagine ever going back to the expensive normal home phone line most people have in their home.

> what ra121212 said is correct. We haven't even registered these with ring central so they are working off the customer list they purchased in the deal with mitel, Most or all of these are our on-prem customers since before we brought them to Mitel.  What we are finding is we have to Register them because ring central is getting deceptive and striking fear to our customers in their emails. saying they should switch over or they may lose their service.

I wouldn't be surprised if eventually they get an email that says "Just check this box to upgrade your service"  and the customer checks it thinking its an upgrade like on a computer or Iphone.  the customer unknowingly gets us cut out of commission and sours the great relationship we've had for years.  

we were once contacted by a friend of one of our customers that was in a night mare switching to ring central and he told us suddenly his current vendor wont answer his calls. after speaking with him we realized that is exactly what happened. he was contacted directly by ring central reps,  he unknowingly got his vendor cut out of the deal.  they were pissed so they told him to f-off.  He said ring central was relentless.  He requested ring list us as his vendor and we should receive the commission and they refused. so now he's stuck calling the Philippines for help.

> Since all your numbers have been ported to the new carrier, and you're most likely in a 2 or 3 year contract as well with the new carrier, you're going to have to buckle down and make this work; unless you're willing to pay the penalty fee to break the contract.  And I hate to say this, but since you were the one pushing for this change, I'm sure upper management is looking for you to fix it as well.  I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.

- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.

- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into production.

- Now that you have the phone make/model that you want to use, you will need to get the SIP registration information from your carrier and configure each phone with those settings.  You will need to get this information from tech support (unless they have some FAQ online that has this information).  Typically, if you had ordered the phones through your carrier, the phones would have been pre-configured and registered to your cloud PBX.  It would have been plug and play as the installation tech communicated to you.  Since you told your sales rep that you wanted to use your own phones, you will need to configure your phones with the correct SIP registration settings.  Those SIP settings would be the username, password, SIP Server address, SIP registration port, backup SIP server if applicable, proxy server and port if applicable.  Most VoIP carriers will push their own configs to the phones once it has successfully registered with the PBX, but the important thing is to get your phones provisioned and registered to the cloud PBX.

- In the admin portal you will need to create your users, build your extensions, assign your users to the devices/phones, create your ring group(s), create your auto attendant, and route calls to your phone numbers accordingly.  Your carrier should have "how to" guides on how to accomplish this.

- Since you are up shits creek with no service because you don't have any phones working, you should check with tech support to see if there is a sof

> I may have made an assumption. Allow me to attempt to unwind my assumption.


> Houston servers are down since (at least) yesterday. 


I took this at face value. If their Houston servers are down, they should automatically redirect your service to a working POP without you having to change your settings. Unless you're in a scenario I describe, where it's known to not work well.


IF, and only if, their Houston servers are offline... POP failover would ensure that when your phone or PBX registers, it will be redirected to a working server.


To verify that, I went to their status page at status.voip.ms and found an incident. https://status.voip.ms/clyg10kxv126823h2ohwkx43hfv


It states


> Our Houston 1 & 2 servers are currently unreachable. Our team has engaged the data center to learn more about this issue and we will post updates as they come. In the meantime, we have routed all the traffic to a back-up server.


Confirmed.


Now, that means that the amount of downtime should be limited to your registration timer. Commonly somewhere between 60 and 300 seconds. So if it's been over 5 minutes and it's still not working, something's broke.


Now so far, we've made no mention of a second trunk to voip.ms as that wouldn't solve the root problem. The root problem is that the server redirection is not working, per their incident page's:


> In the meantime, we have routed all the traffic to a back-up server.


If you are using fairly default settings, such as connecting to Houston over UDP on port 5060, then it should be working. If it's not, you should open a ticket with support and they should be able to sort you out.


To better answer an earlier question you asked now:


> How do you deal with customer, stress and everything, if you set up a line like that at a busy restaurant? And they don't have a phone for a couple of days... 


I'm a sysadmin by trade but in the same spot... after I've become aware that Houston is flaking, I'd change POPs to New York. The phones and PBXes for my managed customers would all be set up such that I could remotely, and securely, manage the settings so long as the customer permits it. Then I'd go back to sleep once it's switched and working.

They didn't want to answer if it was possible without selling me a service contract. I told them if it was possible, I'd pay for the service contract. The guy put me on hold and came back and said it can't be done. 
In the end, we just switched so both companies were using the same provider, but certainly a shortcoming. 
Keep in mind, that was 5 years ago and things may have changed.

> Multiple VOIP phones, one line/service/number.   
Hello all, I have what I THOUGHT was a simple request but turns out none of the VOIP providers I have contacted can assist.

I want a phone in my office and on the production floor. We are a small shop of myself plus two staff (screen printing shop) but I want a phone to ring in both places at once, so I can answer it wherever I (or in my absence someone else) can answer it. This was basic with old school phone lines, as many phones as you want, but with VOIP they want me to pay for a different number/service for every phone it appears. Is there such a thing as a voip base unit + a cordless handset?!

The phones in each room can be corded, cordless, etc, (I'd kind of prefer corded in each location so that handsets can't get lost, left off charger, etc, but I'll take any solution that put both phones on the same line/number and doesn't make me pay for two VOIP lines and works at this point.)

Additional optional complication: I have used Grasshopper for like 8 years, forwarding calls to my cell phone, want to get away from my cell phone, thus the VOIP system. I'd like to abandon grasshopper but my 800 number from grasshopper isn't portable, and apparently only their sister company GoTo can port the number to their service (sounds like Grasshopper holds "vanity numbers" hostage so you can't leave their service). So if I can make GoTo VOIP services work with whatever hardware that is out there that is ideal, otherwise I have to keep Grasshopper as my forward to whatever service I switch to, and end up paying for two services. (Had my 800 number for 8 years and all of our customers know it, so keeping the number is paramount.)

Thanks in advance for any advice ya'll might be able to provide!

> The problem is that most of these systems block/label calls based on the phone number. Phone numbers are not an "identity" and are easily tossed out, switched around, faked, etc. In VoIP it's very easy to just transmit a different number. While STIR/SHAKEN aims to help make this harder to do illegitimately, there are plenty of reasons why it simply can't eliminate all call "spoofing". Keep in mind, there are a lot completely legitimate business cases for spoofing. For example, your kid's school broadcast calling everyone to tell them about a late start due to bad weather. In this example, a broadcasting service would likely transmit the number of the school so you would recognize it. 

Unfortunately the world is focused on phone numbers. Blocking number, labeling numbers, and assigning blame to this problem at the phone number. But the phone number is an ephemerial resource that is meaningless. 

Scammers are really good at manipulating identity. That's how they get people to answer the phone. They do this with phone numbers. We need to introduce ways to transmit IDENTITY on phone calls. You don't care about their phone number, you care about who they are. You'd do the same thing if someone was knocking at your door. Would you ask them for their address, or their ID? 

There are companies focused on this problem, I work for one of them. But it ultimately takes the cooperation of an entire industry to make meaningful change. Not everyone is motivated to solve the problem.

> VOIP set up to mitigate postpartum gender bias :D 

Hi all, first thank you from this noob for any and all help!

What I'm trying to do:

Set up a system in which my partner and I can put down 1 phone number for all admin related to the baby on the way (Dr's office, nursery, immigration office, baby groups etc) which will divert to either of our phone numbers, based on who is 'lead parent' for a chosen time period. For example, we're planning on doing shared parental leave, and then switching back and forth for who is on sick/nursery emergency duty so our careers are more evenly impacted. 

An added bonus would be to be able to divert calls to one of our phones based on who is calling. For example, say all calls from the immigration office divert to me if I'm lead on that, but all call from 'water babies class' divert to my partner bc they're lead on that, etc. 

I've looked at a few VOIP services but am not sure if the above features are covered- it seems that many will divert to 1 additional phone number and you can change that phone number if you wish. This could work for our 'lead parent switch' plan, but feels clunky to me. But, if the lead parent can't answer, it would be important for the other parent to then be called. 

Arw these things that VOIP can do generally? Is this the right route to go? Thank you for any insight! 

_________
Just some context in case interested:
Based on our research and experience so far,  this would massively help combat the structural gender bias in babycare. For example, the NHS (we're in the UK) doesn't even have space for 2 phone numbers in their system and really get tetchy if you suggest not putting in the mother's number...thereby ensuring that all baby medical appt arranging falls on the mother, as well as the task of relaying that knowledge to the other parent. Or, for systems that do have 2 numbers, we've heard from a number of friends that even if the mom's number is listed as 'emergency' she'll get called first, and usually only, from the nursery, etc, even if a note has been put in that the dad is on pat leave and she's working/out of town. 

So this tool is an effort to recognise the reality of gender bias in babycare systems and just sidestep them by staying 1 step ahead of ppl's choices to enact that bias :D

> Well, this is really funny-I'm looking at the Telstra 3 manual, and it seems like it only supports analog phones, so I'm not sure how an 8861 is working already without lots of sorcery. Is it getting dial tone into and out of your home via the internet(like, to your employer?).

If so, I think this is possible, but you may need extra services-because the head scratcher for me, after looking at this manual is that the Telstra sends analog signal to the port marked phone. That's your Plain Old Telephony Service(POTS). If you have a regular ol' phone, that's where it goes. Your Cisco phone doesn't have anything like that. It needs to go in one of the LAN ports.

So, here's what I'm thinking. 

Someone picks up the Aiphone on the outside of your building. If you were just a regular chap with a regular phone, this is going to make a call to whatever phone you have plugged in-**even if you don't have local telco service**. That's just basically someone opening up a circuit in the most uncomplicated way-just a step up from 2 cups and a string.  

Now, the next step is how you connect that to the Telstra. My guess is, in a normal scenario, you'd have the phone line from the outside connect to the section marked PSTN(Public Switched Telephony Network-aka, the global phone system) and then connect the "phone" jack to anything else. That's how you'd get the aiphone to ring a \*regular\* phone. BUT, your Cisco phone is getting service from \*somewhere else\*.

If your being forced to pay for a home phone as part of your building's agreement, the answer may be way simpler-you may just have to have your home phone forward to whatever number is on your Cisco phone. The variable that's hard to account for here is that piece and that's going to determine what the solution is.

> part 2/2:

  
- My Take (again, having never used DIGITS) -



Switching away from providers' CBSS sucks, and that lock-in is what they bank on to keep you as a customer. Were I in your shoes, knowing only what you've put in your original post, I'd consider a few options:



a) ripping that band-aid off, YOLO-ing it and porting the number out. You'll incur downtime of some kind (possibly a week if everything goes right). If you can sync out those contacts into the new system ahead of time, you might not be completely effed (again, message history's gonna be messssssy).



b) starting a new service with a new phone number entirely. Give out the new number to customers and start using it for everything. Keep the old T-Mo service in place for a while, but shift everyone over to the new system. No downtime needed, but wouldn't be a quick process. Annoying and a PITA to maintain two calling/messaging systems, but would incur the fewest "oh shit it's all horribly broken and now so is our business" moments.



c) broadening our scope and looking into more of a CRM than just a calling/texting service. Example: hubspot, while I think can become cost-prohibitive if you're a small shop and try to scale up, integrates with a bunch of calling services (https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/calling). Zoho might be worth considering and integrates with things like RingCentral and Dialpad (I've not used either in a calling capacity, though RC as a company and website has felt a bit heavy/clunky to me). I don't know what you're using to keep track of all your customer interactions (I'm thinking more like the house cleanings, etc, not just calls/messaging), but it could make sense to try to integrate this into a CRM somehow. Might be totally overkill for your needs.



d) look for more a service that offers a true sms inbox. I've seen https://www.openphone.com/ (see https://www.openphone.com/blog/sms-inbox/) recommended elsewhere for calling/voip purposes (never used them, no affiliation). Looks like you can import contacts from a csv https://support.openphone.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500009861242-How-to-import-a-large-number-of-contacts-to-OpenPhone though idk what kind of flexibility/options your business needs. Dialpad I think supports shared sms messaging too (again, no experience with them). Actually, more I look into these pages, the more I think this option might be the right answer. Kinda one of the startup-y companies offering an integrated group call/sms solution with a bunch of purple on their website (cause, you know, it's the hot color right now.....T-Mobile pink is sooooo 2010s lol).



So, that's what I know. Or don't know. Idk. Hope it helps :)

I just switch the phone line from the printer with my cordless phone base when I need to Fax. Heck, even the lame Google Voice service works well if I plug into that port in a pinch.

 I guess I don't fax enough to justify the cost of a separate line and clearly you mileage is better than most. It is worth more in smiles when I tell people you can fax for Free over the Internet if the document is already in PDF format. 🤑 HP has a great app for that.

### r/VOIP — 2023-08-20 | 5pts | `general`

> I'm more proficient with VoIP than I am with traditional telco service, but with your standard handset, whether digital or analog, there's a timer value for your hook switch that will tell the central office phone switch if the line is on-hook (usually anything over 0.9s I think) or if it's signaling for a new dial-tone (i.e. 3-way call or answering a second call).

Based on the description of your problem, it would seem there could be a wiring issue, or possibly a voltage issue since when you depress the hook switch there is voltage that will pass to signal the voice switch to either hang up or switch over for a new line.

If the line has been there for 30 years, without any hardware update/replacement in the last 15 years (such as a media gateway, eMTA/eDVA, etc), you likely have a standard telco NID/NIU that is providing service. If you have a telco butt-set, you can connect the tip and ring to the terminals of that NID/NIU, check for dial-tone, make a call to your cell phone, hang up, and see if the call disconnects on your cell phone. If it does not, you need to call the telco provider to investigate.

> While it is possible in certain cases, the short answer is no. The specific standards still call for A-LAW compatibility when peering. There are no plans to change this at present I believe.

The higher level offerings you speak of (AMR-WB, G722) are not currently offered or planned on a peer to peer basis in the strict sense. The mobile operators offer some AMR-WB compatibility between each other, but it's either internal only or by private agreement between operators which means you will get AMR-WB if you call a Vodafone number from a T-Mobile number, but not if you call a Three number.

The same stands mostly true for those offering G722. BT digital voice will offer G722 but you have to remember that is BT's digital replacement for the PSTN. Even if it's internal only, it's going to cover a VAST number of users.

The best way to find out is to ask your VOIP provider of choice. It would be folly to choose an operator based solely on whether they are going to offer wideband codecs, so pick the one that gives you the best service, price, features, etc. If wideband codec between peers becomes a thing, they will offer it as an almost certainty.

On a side note, I asked this question of Gamma communications when they contacted me about the PSTN switch off and the rep I spoke to said he believed there was some low scale testing going on at the moment but he couldn't expand on what that meant.

### r/VOIP — 2023-06-03 | 1pts | `general`

> The easy way to do this would be to set up the SIP ATA and the Yealink phones as part of a ring group, either in your on-site PBX if you have one or at the VoIP provider's end.  The idea of a ring group is that all phone and ATA's in the ring group will ring until one of them answers the call, and then they will all stop ringing.  In this case the ATA will never answer the call (because you won't connect a phone to it) but it should be able to run the external ringer.  The ATA can even be part of more than one ring group so if you have more than one line coming it, it can ring when any of those lines ring. Note that **if you are using the ATA to feed an old-style mechanical ringer** from back in the "Bell System" days you will need to check the ATA's ringing frequency setting, because by default many use 25 Hz which will cause those old style ringers to either ring weakly or not at all.  In most cases you will need to change the ATA's ringing frequency to 20 Hz (if the ringer is an Automatic Electric device from GTE then all bets are off, they used all sorts of ringing frequencies from 16 Hz up to 66 Hz and the ringer may be tuned to one of them, and that frequency will be stamped on the ringer somewhere.  But the Bell System almost always used 20 Hz ringing frequency exclusively).  If the ringer is a modern type with an electronic tone then the ringing frequency is *probably* not a concern, most of those will be quite happy with 25 **or** 20 Hz.

The trick will be setting it up, and that will depend on whether you have your own on-site phone switch (and if so, whether any of your employees know how to make configuration changes) or whether you are simply getting VoIP service from an outside vendor (and in that case, whether you have to go through that vendor to make configuration changes or have some way to do that yourselves, such as a web-based interface).  Just buying and hooking up an ATA won't do anything unless it is configured to talk to the switch that provides service to all your phones.  VoIP devices are not like older phone equipment where you can just tap into the right pair of wires and hook up your ringer.

This is also true with some other solutions proposed in this thread.  There is no device you can buy that is going to "just work" without configuration of both the device and the switch (local PBX or external) that provides service to your phones.  And if you have no idea how to do that configuration, you'd probably best figure out who does before you start buying equipment.

Static IP - yes, of course I have one, I wouldn't even think about running a PSTN-interconnected cellular network without having my MSC (Mobile services Switching Center, a GSM architecture term) at a static and public IP address. IPv4 only currently, but if I need IPv6, it should be easy to add.

I do **not** use any compressed voice codecs like G.729, instead I only use G.711 PCMU and PCMA. When I receive incoming calls at my current BulkVS numbers, I get a SIP INVITE message, and the included SDP offers PCMU, PCMA and G729 - I am referring to the offer/answer model of SDP, as in RFC 3264. My inbound call gateway (I wrote my own SIP software) always responds with an answer that accepts either PCMU or PCMA, whichever is offered, but never accepts G729 or any other non-G.711 codec. My outbound gateway (another piece of SIP software written by me) always sends out INVITEs with SDP offering only PCMU and PCMA, no others.

When it comes to outbound international routes, I am looking for some that won't butcher my G.711 calls by passing them through some compressed voice codec internally. Assume that the destination country I am calling has its own legacy PSTN that runs on G.711 64 kbps channels internally - I want a clear-channel 64 kbps path from my outbound gateway to the destination country's legacy G.711 PSTN, without any hidden/surreptitious transcoding being done covertly by a "cheap" route. Why do I insist on such a transparent G.711 64 kbps channel? One of the reasons I seek such a thing is because I wish to implement 3GPP TS 28.062 in-band TFO (tandem-free operation) for GSM to GSM calls, which is only possible with a clear 64 kbps G.711 channel that no one is mucking with along the way.

Any idea which provider(s) I should focus on if I am looking for someone who will pass my G.711 64kbps voice channel through transparently to the destination country, rather than pass through some compressed codec?

> Yeah, I think overall it is a good platform, and if you're providing it to businesses it's nice especially since it is super customizable and open to so many different scenarios and use cases. Long as you understand the risks and put in place things to minimize them with the lack of cluster and node support. I was toying around with the idea of running proxmox or xen clusters to host the PBX VMs and then do some dns proxy to load balance the call requests. But I'd also have to figure out how to keep the working directories synced across them all.. or just have the clusters in a HA failover scenario to give additional failover systems instead of just one. At some point, it just became more beneficial to look at other systems that are already setup for redundancy and hosted to keep this headache and overhead cost off my plate.

And I just started providing phone services last year. I only have a little over 100 extensions set with a couple of tenants. With about 50 or so set up in the pipeline soon to be onboarded. So really I'm probably not the best judge. There are other users with a much larger customer base that would have better insight into it than me. There's a user here on Reddit named TheRealNalaLockspur that owns a company called Sipharmony that uses Vodia for its cloud system. I would bet he's the biggest player using the platform you would find around here if you want to reach out. He would be your best insight into the ins and outs of the platform. They have done a lot of in-house dev stuff to really make the platform their own from what I have seen.

I liked Netsapiens enough when I was looking at it. But when it's literally one of the major platforms out there.. It's just hard to justify a company going with you over a larger outfit that provides the exact same phone service. At probably a lower price because they can offset the costs and margins with volume. I think it's better than most other larger providers, but at the same time what differentiates you and them? Apart from support, and pricing, you're literally the exact same feature set and user experience as competing MSPs or VoIP companies in your area. Just my 2c and how I view it all. Definitely not knocking Netsapiens or anyone using it or providing it like OIT, Viirtue, RingLogix, etc. I think it's a solid platform overall.

As for alternatives I've been looking at a company called Voxo. They fully host everything, are redundant, they have one seat price for partners that include literally everything. Nothing is extra apart from toll-free and international minutes. They also collect, remit, and pay all FCC, USAC, USF, telecom tax bs on your behalf. So you literally only pay a flat fee per extension and that's it. It's a much smaller company than anyone using netsapians, or any of the other big cloud providers. Nextiva, Zoom, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral, etc. But honestly, that's what I like about them. Support is super fantastic. I literally get a response within minutes and

> The niche is the hardest, so congrats on that. 

An older IT business owner once advised me that I needed to work on finding MRR - that it would change my life. 

I went back to the shop and worked on it for weeks until I figured it out. He was right...it's life changing.

You want three things, huh? Here we go...

1. Rethink why you price projects the way you do. As an example, does your cost to build a website REALLY justify the price you charge? Or are you charging that much because you only have one shot at making money on the thing, and you know you'll have downtime after it's done? Could you lower your price IF you had a 12-month commitment?
2. For work that is naturally project work, don't just spread the project cost out over the duration. That's not MRR. That's more like providing the client a credit-free, interest-free loan they pay off over time. The idea with pricing is that you want to NOT go underwater in the beginning of the engagement while making more money during future months.
3. Start pitching MRR solutions. The longer you pitch projects, the longer you'll be doing only project work. Once you're ready, pitch your offering only as a recurring service with a recurring fee, even if upfront work is required. Clients actually like MRR solutions because they smooth the outbound cash flow and provide predictability. 

Bonus answer:

* You don't have to switch 100% to MRR. Instead, you can charge for obvious project work like building the website and obvious MRR work like hosting and support. Mix and match if you'd like. Some clients will appreciate that because the payments naturally align with the amount of work over time.

I hope that gives you a few things to think about. 

Keep at it. MRR will change your life.

> The solution helps them increase their conversion rate through the traffic they already have, by engaging all leads, answering all questions these leads may have, and qualifying leads that weren’t spoken to. This way it would make them money by qualifying their leads and setting appointments without the need of staff and also automate their customer service. 

With the videos, I mean out of the people that received the videos only 2 out of 6 didn’t get back to me, everyone else was interested. But out of the 4 that responded 3 were agencies that wanted to partner and white list my product and only one was a actual client. 

I think my problem is my outreach message tho, not getting enough replies to it. So now I’m trying to do more like a bait and switch outreach in different markets. But I’m not sure if my leads are ass or my message is ass

> I tell them the SEO industry is full of snake oil salesman and scammers. It’s a Wild West out there and anyone can be anything. The best way to filter them out is if anyone claims they can get you to the first page of Google in a few months they are a scammer because it doesn’t work that way. It takes time and lots of work to do it. We need to build authority with Google and have lots of content on our site that answers our customers questions and satisfies their searches. Or if you ask someone what they’d do for SEO work and you’re given a bunch if buzzwords that you never heard of before or understand, they’re a scammer. Real SEO people want you to know exactly what they’re doing, what it does, why it matters, and how it works. They don’t hide behind obscurity. They are open and thorough with a set plan and proven results form happy clients you can contact as a reference. When they ask me what my SEO guy does, I tell them this:

SEO consists of 2 parts - on page SEO and off page SEO. 

On page SEO are things you can do on the site itself. Like the design, content, load times, accessibility, blogging, etc. 

Off page are things you do off the site. Like building backlinks to your site; citations, social media, guest posting on blogs, etc. 

Together these comprise your SEO strategy. I am good at on page stuff like accessibility for screen readers and design and load times. My sites score 100/100 page speed score from google. Google likes my sites because they load instantly on mobile and we get extra ranking online because of it. My SEO partner Adam does the content, backlinks, curations, blogging, ads, etc. so my work in his hands makes a complete SEO strategy to regularly create relevant content about your services and building them efficiently so they load fast and make google happy. 

SEO is not a short term flip of a switch and your ranking front page. It takes 6-12 months to see the effects of good SEO strategy. It’s a long term investment. For short term gains you run google ads to show up in relevant searches at the top and get seen by your clients at the point they’re looking for your services. 

So SEO + ads + social media management is what makes a complete marketing strategy to maximize your reach online and be seen my as many customers online as possible. 

If you don’t have an SEO guy or a budget for my SEO guy, What I do is I do searches for my clients keywords in large city metro areas in a different state and open all the top ranking sites. I analyze the keywords they’re using and content, feed it into chatGPT and have it write new content based on that content from those pages and to pretend it’s a copywriter for websites. Then it gives me the content, I edit it to make it sound more human or change sentence structure, and add it to the site. I know what sections I need on a site and what order and what content I need and where to put the keywords. I do this for interior service pages called content silos as well. These content

> Hey Jake, thanks for such a massive breakdown for my question. I love that. Read the answer for almost 3 times and  I appreciate all of the effort and time you took to answer all of my questions.
Before posting this question on reddit. I saw one of your comments on some other posts too which was about building a community for agency owners
I joined to discord channel of this subreddit from that post and also subscribed to your podcast too! Will surely explore that soon

So at first- reason for my starting this agency. Your assumption is partially correct because my goal is to make money. I am currently 19 years old and I am passionate about making money online. I have tried a lot of things before too. I was building websites, I used to sell SEO backlinking services too, then I switched to build operations and project management systems to agencies
But none of then really stick to me because some services were very hard to fulfill like operational systems and some were very commoditized like website design. 

I have recently dropped out from university too and I watch a lot of content on YouTube and the service I am currently providing = lead generation. Really appealed to me because every business needs more leads and if I can have a performance based offer, no one should hesitate in working with me( in my assumption )

That's the reason I have no monetary capital as well to invest in tools. This is the free website I made for my business:

Artileads.typedream.app 

Now, I am trying to find someone whom I can work for on performance basis

And thanks for the giving me access to asking questions from you. That's so kind of you and surely I will reach out to you when I will have any questions.

Thanksss a lot, Jake!

**Agency work is difficult because:**

1. the emotional energy of relationships
2. chasing one-time projects (many switch to recurring)
3. race to the bottom / commoditized services
4. variable inputs
5. variable timelines
6. variable outputs
7. you wear too many hats (divided attention/focus)
8. moving target of client expectations
9. the client's selective hearing
10. client's going silent due to their other responsibilities (or they don't want to pay)
11. taking on problem clients (and not knowing when to fire them)
12. money squeeze of making good money, but not enough to expand.
13. offering too many services (spreading focus to thin)

> Hey u/First-Ad4474   
  
Totally get where you're coming from. Scaling a consultancy is tough, especially because it’s such a personal service. Clients aren't interested in generic advice, they want to feel like you understand their specific challenges and can offer tailored, expert input (not something they could easily get themselves from ChatGPT).    
  
From what you’re saying, it sounds like you’re looking for a way to scale your expertise without losing that personal touch, which is definitely doable. One way some people go about it, is by piecing together a DIY setup: sending out a questionnaire (like what you'd ask during a first discovery call), scoring the responses in a spreadsheet, and then generating a PDF with some feedback based on that score. You can put this together with tools like Google Forms, Sheets, maybe even Zapier or Make. But this can get messy fast, especially when you're juggling multiple clients or want things to look polished and on-brand.  
  
That’s actually why a lot of consultants end up switching to an all-in-one tool like Pointerpro (full disclosure: I work there). Our tool lets you build your own assessments and automatically generate personalized PDF reports based on the answers people gave. Super handy for qualifying leads, doing intake, or even running more in-depth audits, without having to build everything from scratch every time.  
  
Happy to share more if you're curious, but no pressure at all. Just wanted to throw it out there as something that might save you time and make your process smoother.

Cheers,  
H.

> Really nice answer. I admire your help.

The Ukrainian market is quite different from that of other countries. There are not many big players who use consulting services, so there are no companies like EY Parthenon here. I work at S&O KPMG. Besides, of the big three, there is only McKinsey with about 30 consultants. So there is not a lot of choice in the context of the big three.

About me. Previously taught English, but decided to look for a job in my specialty. Now I've finished 3 undergraduate courses and am going into my 4th. I'm studying at the best university in the country. There is no opportunity for men to leave the country, so no internships either.

I like different case championships, I won a couple of small ones, also I reached the finals of the Deloitte tax championship. This year I want to try CFA with my team.

University activities are an added plus. In my department, we were involved in inviting speakers for the university, and they talked about their startups, their work in various companies, and so on.

I'm thinking about switching to another company because I'm afraid of getting stuck in one place and then it will be difficult to change it. I like my job and my team. So now I see two options in front of me:

1.	⁠Continue to do what I do, but in a more serious firm.
2.	⁠Go into investment banking. I am interested in it, first of all, because I see people who I think are smart going there. Thanks to you, I now have more options!

> Wow, that sounds comprehensive! 

\> We have an AI proposal builder built off our knowledge base. It’s early days;

Is it built internally using an open source or a cloud LLM, or is it a third-party company providing it as a service or building it for you?

\> I’ve used these Gen AI solutions to research and list case studies … I recon each time they come up with 50% or more fabricated cases … or at least cases I can’t find any evidence off;

Just the regular chatgpt/copilot/gemini/claude, or the proposal builder trained on your knowledge base? I never thought of using GenAI for case studies, just searching for keywords and hashtags on our knowledge base or google. Now that I write this, it sounds so old school lol, google itself will sometimes give me a generated response...

\> the results still smell like AI

I once had a discussion with chatgpt where it used a regular tone answering my question, but immediately switching to ridiculously optimistic for a section it suggested putting into the document. I'm like - hey, come on, I just saw you can use a normal tone!

I tried something like this for style and tone and it helped to some degree - https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1930ljx/how\_to\_make\_chat\_gpt\_mimic\_your\_writing\_style/. Have you tried?

\> I wouldn’t risk my career on an interns work

I'm totally with you. But I'm thinking - how far we can teach the LLM to do the right thing? Same as you need to teach a new hire if you want them to really perform.

Imagine a day in 10 years - an AI-generated demand creates an AI-generated RFP responded by an AI-generated proposals from different vendors and evaluated by AI selecting a winner, and then a winner proposal and the original RFP used to generate a cloud deployment that just works. GenAI will call it ZHIT - Zero Human Interaction Transaction.

It still took a random chance for me to discover that MBB was a term and that those were the prestigious cherry on top. I had read reports and attended their presentations - EY, BCG, McKinsey, pwc, Deloitte etc. I was genuinely disappointed by the BCG study and the authors. It was on a niche topic I was obsessed with for my master thesis. The graphics were legit ugly and poorly done, and the authors didn’t strike me as experts on the topic. They couldn’t directly answer my question on related legislature. Meanwhile my future boss and team at Deloitte had published such smooth reports I was sending snippets to my BF. At the interview, they were interested in my thesis and asked very specific questions, clearly being very familiar with the topic and all possible ways of calculating my problem. I subscribe to Deloitte services sending me reports and highlights from the global economy mainly because the way they condense and present the info is so satisfying. I genuinely dig this company and wouldn’t switch it for 60+ hour workweeks at any of my country’s MBBs. I wasn’t impressed by what I saw.

> TL;DR: I recently transitioned from a three-year career in auditing to management consulting, specifically focusing on Finance Transformation at an international consulting firm in a non-English speaking country. I'm feeling somewhat lost about the nature of my new role and the day-to-day tasks. I'm seeking advice since I just started this week and haven't been assigned to a project yet.  
  
Hello everyone! I'm reaching out for guidance regarding my new career in Management Consulting. I'm thrilled to have joined an international consulting firm in a non-English speaking country this week. However, I have numerous questions that I can't seem to find answers to.  
  
Here's my background: I spent the past three years working at an audit firm. My clients primarily consisted of medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their business activities. During this time, I progressed from a junior auditor to a senior auditor and gained valuable experience.  
  
Over time, though, I found the audit work becoming somewhat repetitive, and with the busy season approaching, I decided to leave this summer. Rather than switching to another auditing firm, I wanted to venture into something new. So, I applied to several management consulting firms and was accepted by one after completing the interview rounds.  
  
Throughout the interviews, I could articulate my reasons for shifting from auditing to consulting and explain what I could bring to the consulting field. However, I struggled to grasp the day-to-day responsibilities of a management consultant. It all seemed quite nebulous, with people using buzzwords (mixing a lot of english words with local language and using a lot of acronyms) when I asked for concrete details about their work. Most responses to my questions about tasks and responsibilities boiled down to "it depends".  
  
Despite the uncertainty, I chose to pursue a career in management consulting to gain a better understanding of what a consultant does, and work for MNCs. I'm currently working in a practice that offers Finance Transformation services. I've just started this week, and I haven't been assigned to a project yet (though it's likely to happen next week).  
  
  
My primary goal is to understand what will be expected of me, the deliverables I'll be responsible for, and the day-to-day routine of a management consultant. Additionally, I'd like to know which skills will be the most valuable as I'm eager to grow in this role.

So if you can provide any help or advice, feel free to reply here or contact me directly. 

&#x200B;

Have a great day !

> I went to law school so I could sue big companies and hold wrongdoers responsible for the injuries they cause. 

I love representing Plaintiffs who are really hurt. Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. 

If...

If only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. 

I had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. 

One quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. 

There are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  

In the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.

But oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. 

Then there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. 

When they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. 

Oddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. 

Your client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every

**Automation.** Your software should be sending reminders, not you. If you're personally chasing invoices, you've already failed. Set it up once. Never think about it again.

**Late fees.** Put them in the engagement letter. Enforce them. Stop apologizing for running a business.

The real answer? Stop doing work for people who haven't paid you. It's that simple. You're a lawyer, not a bank. You don't extend credit.

Every hour you spend “managing collections" is an hour you could spend on work that actually pays. Fix the intake process. The rest solves itself.

> Yes, this happens to every solo who answers their own phone because you are the buyer and you are reachable, so you become a quota target. Blocking does not solve it because they just rotate numbers and sometimes it is literally the same rep pretending it is not. The only thing that works is making the phone stop being a free front door. Unknown numbers go to voicemail and you only call back when the message sounds like a real client with a real legal problem. If you want to keep speed for new matters, use screening like YouMail or a simple answering layer so clients get through and sales gets parked in a message you can ignore. When a vendor does get you live, do not debate, just say please remove me from your list and hang up, because every extra sentence teaches them that pushing works. What matters more for you, never missing a potential new client call, or getting your day back from constant interruptions?

> The biggest thing I wish I’d done a year earlier was stop thinking in ''tools'' and start thinking in \*systems\*. Software, websites, and marketing are easy to buy later. What’s hard to retrofit is how work actually flows through your firm.

For family law especially, get very clear on your \*default process\* now: intake - consult - retainer - pleadings - discovery - settlement vs trial - enforcement. If you don’t standardize that early, you’ll end up reinventing the wheel under stress and leaking time on non-billable admin. Build templates, checklists, and timelines for your most common scenarios (custody, support mods, contempt, emergency motions). That’s what gives you leverage as volume grows.

On the business side, start quietly stress-testing your book of business: which referral sources actually convert, who pays on time, and which case types drain energy or cash. Family law will happily consume all your time if you let it, so deciding \*what you won’t take\* is just as important as marketing.

Tech-wise, pick boring, reliable core systems (practice management, billing, document storage) and resist over-customizing early. Where AI actually helps solos isn’t ''magic answers,'' it’s reducing the planning and drafting tax. Tools like AI Lawyer are useful for first-pass drafting, issue checklists, and organizing facts so your billable time goes to strategy and client management, not rewriting the same motions over and over.

Last thing: start acting like an owner before you are one. Track your time even when you don’t have to. Write down your ideal fee structures. Practice having hard money conversations. By the time you open in 2027, you want execution to feel familiar, not like a personality change

If you want to sanity-check one thing first: how many \*ideal\* family law matters per month do you actually want, and what does that require in terms of intake and workflow? That answer should drive almost every prep decision.

> Wow. *Bottom-feeding clients?* 

I have to assume you’ve never experienced adversity before or don’t understand nuance? Because clients are real people. It’s so weird to see some of you forget that indigent/poor people exist? People in domestic violence situations? People hurt in accidents? People who lost their identities? People who are being stalked? People who have their savings stolen? People asking for DNRS and power of attorney?

They can all be normal people scared by the situations they’ve been placed in. And they don’t have our knowledge or security that things may be okay. Thats like asking people to stop using WebMd to check their symptoms. Yes, it makes the doctors life harder, but the sometimes the patient isn’t doing it to be an asshole. And sometimes the doctor *actually is shit.* They’re doing it because this is the harrowing moment in their lives and they don’t have a clue about what’s going on. 

I *hate* the way GenAI has absolutely wrecked the landscape. It’s annoying, it’s frustrating, and muddles everything when you’re the one who knows best. But I definitely have some grace for those who are worried and looking for some kind of answer or help during a weary time.

> Lawyer who does IT for firms.  

Have your IT department or provider fill out the technical parts of your application.  Don't fudge your answers as it will be held against you if you are breached.


By default your IT provider should be doing the following for you.  

1) Make sure to have MFA on all accounts, avoid using SMS and use the authenticator app if possible

2) If you are using office365 you need a separate backup for Mail and SharePoint data.  SkyKick is a good option.  Your IT provider should be providing this, BUT you should confirm. With Skykick, you can restore mailboxes and calendars in hours after things are encrypted.  Don't sleep on your office365 backup.  


3) Make sure to have what is called an IDR solution.  This is just a detection, prevention, and remediation tool.  You can use something like sentinel one or even Microsoft Defender for Business.  

4) This tip has saved our clients a lot of headaches.  Have your IT folks set the logo on your Office 365 login page to your company logo.  Educate staff so that if they don't see the firm logo not to log into that page

5) Get cybersecurity education from a company like KnowBe4.  There are a lot of anti phishing tools that are available.  You can test users and if they fail they get training auto assigned.

6) Make sure your IT department has inTune setup and computers encrypted 

7) Firewalls, small firms are great using Meraki's line of products.  Avoid Sonicwalls and Watchguards.  Ubiquiti's gear is okay in a pinch

8) Block all USB storage on computers and use a secure messaging platform like Apprivier 

9) If you use Office365 for emails, have your IT firm flag emails that are external.  This will help a lot with spoofing attacks.

10) Stop letting users use personal devices for out of office work, get them firm issued computers and bring them under your security structure.

> I do free consults but it’s with my paralegal. In order to speak with the attorney, the lowest I charge is $200 and I offer that fee to be applied to the matter. I use to speak to clients for free but then that wouldn’t turn into conversion. Basically, my paralegal/case manger vets the client first and then if it’s a good fit we move on to the next phase to schedule with me. It also weeds out tirekickers because if you cannot afford $200, then you probably aren’t in financial position to hire my firm at this time. 

I’ve found this way to be beneficial because my paralegal cannot answer legal questions. I had one client who refused to talk to the paralegal for the initial and wanted to speak with me (PC was also an attorney). I accepted because it was from a referral partner but to this day, PC wasted my time as PC still has not retained the firm. That’s when I stopped doing the free consults unless PC has been fully vetted from a reliable source.

> Congrats on the new role! We work with a lot of small firms, and you’re definitely not alone, many still rely on manual timesheets until someone finally says, “there’s got to be a better way.”

What usually matters most for smaller practices is:

* *Simplicity* — if it takes more time to manage the software than the timesheet itself, it’s not worth it.
* *Accuracy* — missed or forgotten entries add up quickly, especially in a billable environment.
* Affordability — you don’t need a massive enterprise system to get solid results.  

At Billables AI, we focus on automating as much of the process as possible. Instead of manually logging, the software captures work in the background and organizes it into clear, ready-to-use time entries. That way, you’re not adding another administrative burden on top of your legal work.

The biggest “pro” we hear is that firms stop losing hours to memory gaps, and the main “con” is just the adjustment period—it feels strange at first to let software do the tracking for you. But once it clicks, the timesheet process becomes much smoother.

Happy to answer questions if you want specifics on how it might fit for a smaller firm setup.

> At the most basic level, the answer is simple: other firms are already implementing AI, and clients will notice if you’re not.

But the heart of your post seems to be: Why would I use AI when I can have a paralegal bill for the same work and make more money?

The short answer: because when your competitors stop charging two hours for something AI does in minutes, you’ll either start losing clients — or, worse, face serious complaints about your billing practices. And it’s not just a business risk — it’s also a reputational and ethical one. As AI becomes more capable, continuing to bill for tasks that could be automated starts to look like you’re padding hours.

This change is inevitable. Even if your clients aren’t pushing now, they will. There’s a short window where AI is still optional. Soon, it’ll be expected and you’ll be scrambling to catch up when clients start asking why your competition delivers the same result in half the time for less money.

As for upcharging: clients pay for value, not process. If AI lets you deliver better outcomes, faster, with fewer errors — you might justify premium pricing. But you’re not going to get away with charging for what’s clearly been automated busywork for too long.

> 1) I have a DND sign on my door. If I’m actually busy (like on a call or in phone court) I just ignore the knocking. People know not to open my door when the sign is up unless it’s really, super urgent - like I’ve said “when these documents come in, bring them to me immediately, I don’t care what I’m doing” or “the building is on fire.” For you, you have a lock. That + DND sign + not answering should get the hint across. 

2) Ask them to make a list of questions and bother you once every two hours, or twice a day, rather than wandering in and out of your office whenever they have a thought.

3) If you walk out of your office (bathroom, drink), stop by their desk to answer questions. Tell them you will be doing this so that they can compile their questions and ask them all at once. 

4) Have you told him directly that when the DND sign is up, you can’t be disturbed?

5) How often is your DND sign up? I try to use mine only when I really need peace, to keep people from thinking “oh, she always has it up, it doesn’t mean anything.” 

6) Start redirecting them to other resources, if possible. Like other paralegals. Train them to seek help from others before coming to you.

> None. I'm a paralegal.

Literally the definition of my job is to be more efficient than AI. I'm also creative, which by definition, AI is not. 

Just this morning, I had a great example of why AI sucks. Google is now so pro-AI that it has made the top search results you see "AI generated." My SA asked me a simple question:

> "Find me examples of how third party communication might constitute "unwanted contact' under state stalking statutes.

Google search? A TON of silliness, mostly drawn from the blogs of lawyers trying to get cases.

Ten minutes actually READING the certs in Fastcase and downloading PDFs for her? What we needed.

You ask about summarizing medical records. I do this. As my job. But what _**I**_ do that an AI doesn't is ask my SA what she wants in the summary. Am I looking for a smoking gun, where someone fucked up and we need to prove it? Am I looking for a pattern of wrongfulness? Am I just checking the box because the insurance company demands three years of medical records before processing the claim?

The /r/paralegal subreddit is full of angsty worry about "how is AI going to change our jobs" but the truth is... at its best, it is another tool to research. But I guarantee (for example), an AI is not going to read an IDI/SRO report and know what is the best way to serve someone. Nor is it good at determining which shell company is the real one and which are the mirrors.

Honestly, the world will be a much better place when people stop asking "how are you using this shiny new tool?" and start asking "so, anything pop up as a game-changer in your investigation, organization, or production of materials?"

For me, admittedly knowing that my job LITERALLY depends on being better than "AI"... short answer is nope. Free Lexis access in my county law library has been 1000X more valuable than "AI" tools.

> I'm not an attorney, but I've both had this problem and have shared this advice in the past. You need to establish *communications rules* with everyone who contacts you. Here are the elements:

**Rule 1: Channel Dictates Urgency**

You have several communications channels: snail mail, fax (lol legal industry), email, Teams messages, calls, text messages. First, pare them down. Throw away the fax machine.

Next, organize these channels in a hierarchy based on how quickly people need a *reply* from you: emails are non-urgent FYIs, phone calls are "I am literally in jail right now," and everything else goes on a ladder somewhere in between.

Finally, communicate that hierarchy to people who communicate with you. An email footer that reminds people that you only check your inbox twice a day can go a long way toward training people to communicate urgency elsewhere.

**Rule 2: Urgency Dictates Response Time**

Not everything needs your attention right now, or today, or this week, or *ever*. Once you've established your channel system, set expectations on response times. *All* of my clients know to email me reports but to Slack me time-sensitive questions because I've educated them on my process. I clear my inbox by the end of the day, but sometimes I don't address low-urgency items until the end of the week. However, if I get a phone call, I stop what I'm doing to answer it.

In other industries (like IT) this is called an SLA: a Service Level Agreement. Your clients know that if they email you, they might never hear from you again, but if they text you, they'll get a response that same day. Use that to organize your workflow and help your clients feel like they know what to expect.

**Rule 3 (for lawyers): Have a Backstop**

If your secretary/case assistant/paralegal doesn't already have delegated access to your inbox, voicemail, and Teams channels, then fix that ASAP. None of this works if you have the constant fear of missing a communication or a filing, so you need a backstop, and it's a good practice anyway. Set the expectation that all of the channels get emptied and scheduled for response every single day so that nothing gets left behind.

Anyway, hope that helps. I'm sure someone is making some "AI" powered thingie to make all of my advice obsolete, but until then, good luck.

> If your entire business depends on SEO, then simply don't do it. 

I have worked as a white-label SEO consultant with agencies in USA, and have ranked websites in PI/Car accident niches including locations like Las Vegas, New Orleans where CPC is 100$+, I will answer this based on my actual experience.   
  
SEO would only work if you have other active client accusation channels. Be it referrals, paid ads. I am saying this because SEO is momentum. No body can actually tell whether it will work for you or not till you spend a certain amount of time testing it. 

If you don't have other active channels, this will work as a double ended sword, you might not only loose significant money, you will loose time, which I feel is more valuable. 

First thing is to figure out how much it would cost to run PPC ads, and what is the cost per click in your niche. If this is within your reach, test it out by targeting keywords that are used by people desperately in need for a lawyer. Many times, PPC firms would go after broad terms just to inflate the reports and very little money is spend on keywords that would actually bring in desperate leads. 

Second thing is to find out if your website/landing page is built to convert. I have seen this on several projects where the website looks like a blog, and the service page content is nothing but huge chunk of texts that no body would read. Treat your service area pages as if you are spending 10k per month driving PPC ads to that single page with 50$ a click. This will change your perspective and you will start treating the page from users perspective.

Sadly, there is so much dream selling done in Legal niche by agencies, pushing backlinks as magic bullets to Lawyers just to justify the hefty retainers. 

I have worked with agencies who would hire us for 2k and flip it for 8-10k by adding bunch of articles and backlinks which in reality, won't move the needle.

We have ranked for car accident lawyer terms, competing with big legal firms with massive budgets just based on these 3 things:  
1. You need to reverse engineer what's working for the top 5 results and try to build a better page than them.  
By better page, I simply don't mean more content or backlinks, here I mean engagement. That's possibly the no #1 thing that has helped us achieve results. If people spend more time on your page than the competitors, Google has no other choice but to give you visibility.

2. Focus on user experience and design of your page. The goal is not to drive more traffic, but convert the traffic as well. This is sold by some fancy CRO terms, but in reality its more about common sense. We build wireframes for each page that we optimize and pass that on to the design team. They then build on them. 

3. Build authority for your core service area that can get you maximum business. If you are a PI lawyer and you try to build authority for everything under the scope of PI, you become a generalist. It's impossible for Google to give real e

Going to court can easily cost 3.5 hrs depending on how close you are to the court.  How many hours dyou put into a $600 case, on average.  When do you jack up the price?  Also, employer plan referral?  What’s that?


In NYS, for example, you can’t use a P.O. Box only, you must have a location that can receive service, like a reception desk.  This drives up cost, but you can find something like that for $100 per month, without actually using the offices onsite- they charge extra for that.  This may not be the case in other states.  

One simple way to stop clients from leaving reviews about not having an office, is simply to include on your business card, or your website “satellite office” and also “by appointment only, various locations depending on client.”  You can always elaborate when you actually talk with them, but put them on notice that you’ll counsel them remotely, or whatever better language you can use.  You can also reply on google by stating the same.  And do it so it makes sense and sounds good to the potential clients who are reading.

> Hi. I’ve been in PI in CA for more than a decade. Both sides. Currently just about a year in on my own practice. 

To answer your questions:

1. About 80% of my cases do not need to be litigated.

2. The Rutter group makes a CA personal injury guide. I’ve used it throughout my career. It’s an excellent resource.

3. Negotiating a PI case correctly requires experience. Value is based on a lot of factors that you can’t really handle without experience.

4. Fees are typically from the gross settlement. My firm does 35% (prelit) and then everything else (special and general damages) goes to the client. But the client has to pay medical bills from that (you are responsible for negotiating and resolving those liens). Client keeps what is left over. Resolving liens (especially statutory liens in CA) can be their own nightmare.

 Lastly, the business side is difficult, but what people often don’t discuss is client management. That’s a headache in its own right. Half my clients are easy to manage. The other half call everyday asking for money, they want loans, they want to know why the other insurance company is denying liability when “it’s clearly the other persons fault”, they want to know why they’re not getting a million dollars from a fender bender when they only treated at an urgent care once and then told doctors they were fine and stopped going to treatment. They’re rude. They make threats.

Then there’s staff management. Super hard to find experienced people without paying a premium. Even then, staff have conflicts sometimes. They have lives and aren’t dedicated to your business sometimes. Sometimes you hire someone who seems like a good fit and they aren’t. All of those things cause headaches.

> Here are some tech things that help our clients that should help you too.

1. Do your payroll through Gusto.  It is super easy, cost effective, and they will do all your filings.  They will make it easier to onboard new employees and do their filings as well

2. One of the best things I ever did to fix my scheduling is to start using calendly.  It syncs to your calendar and blocks off meeting times accordingly.  I usually block off the first and last hours of the day to make sure I have time to get things done

3. Stop sending gifts to lawyers, it never yields business.  Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.

4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  

5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.

6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.  They are a great referral partner.

Good luck and hang in there.

> See my comment about using other opportunities as a reason to push for a raise. Somewhat dangerous strategy if your partners are the moody type. But, personally, I stopped checking Above the Law - or whatever the current gossip board on salaries is - fifteen years ago. Salary surveys are expensive and sometimes I get out of synch with the market. If an associate tells me they can make more elsewhere and I like their work, I’m gonna match it if I can.

Then again, if you know the current place isn’t a long term fit, personally, that answers the question. Life is short. We spend all our f’in time in the office. Find an office you want to be in. Then do good work, optimize your economics, and the money will come.

> A lot of different answers in this thread but I’ll give you my experience from working both plaintiff and defense in my jurisdiction…

The answer is yes, many people in the personal injury supply chain have a financial stake in lawyer referrals - first responders, towing companies, hospital / healthcare workers, union representatives, and so on. 

It used to be straightforward cash for referrals, now there’s less obvious ways it gets done to get around legal and ethical hurdles.  

For example- look into who is actually paying for many of the lawyer billboards in your area. In my jurisdiction, it’s not uncommon for law firm advertising to be paid for by unaffiliated “marketing companies” that are comprised by different stakeholders - chiropractors and other first-stop clinics typical.

Why would chiropractors and doctors pay to advertise for a law firm? Because when those medical providers refer the injured patient to their choice lawyers, those lawyers can negotiate to protect the liens (ie the medical bills) of those providers to make sure they’re paid as-billed. If your jurisdiction has a collateral source rule, bills generated by providers are typically 2-3x higher than what a normal insurance carrier would reimburse, so personal injury patients are much much more valuable to the medical provider than someone paying with Blue Cross, etc. 

Still, those providers need lawyers to take the cases and get them paid. So they establish relationships with firms and it’s understood between them that the providers will keep referring patients in exchange for the lawyers protecting their bills. 

Once the scale exceeds a certain point, it can make sense for providers to advertise (and pay for) lawyer advertising to increase the amount of referrals from the firm to the providers. 

People who defend this arrangement will say everybody wins - the doctors who provide treatment (often to poor/broke patients that can’t afford to pay themselves) get paid top dollar for their treatment, injured people are directed to lawyers who know ostensibly what they’re doing, and the lawyers get more cases. 

I’m not aware of disciplinary actions in my jurisdiction against this, but I am aware of firms doing it openly and obtaining their own ethics opinions/white papers that say this is kosher to use in the event the ethics board ever cracks down on this (which will never happen). 

There’s other examples as well - it’s not exactly bribery for a law firm to sponsor expensive events / make donations to certain unions with the understanding that the union reps will funnel workplace injuries back to that firm in return, for example. 

I’d be speculating on how your particular case with the auto shop would work, but it’s easy to imagine auto shops getting some financial benefit (indirectly or directly) for referring people to a certain firm. Heck, it probably wouldn’t even have to be a nefarious arrangement- law firms with clients who need auto work can send their clients to

> The majority of cases I've handled deal with car crashes.  Should that be your situation, advise your client to be very wary about questions involving time, speed, or distance.

These are objective facts, but unless you were looking at a stop watch or had a radar gun, well-intended answers can be vastly wrong.

I can't count the number of times a deponent has given a crazy estimate, such as they stopped 100 feet behind the car in front of them at a stop light (Really?  1/3 of a football field?)  Or they were waiting at a stoplight fir about 10 minutes before the collision (No you weren't), or that the car that rear ended the had to be going 50 MPH (As evidenced by the minor scuff on your rear bumper).

I always tell my clients not to speculate. Do not give a best guess.  Do not give an estimate.  A smart attorney will use it against you.

> > I am constantly anxious, stressed out, and I find myself taking all of that home with me.

Learning how to regulate and process your emotions is the single best skill any lawyer can make. What you're finding is when the core problem is being dysregulated vis-a-vis stifling your emotions instead of processing them, then the cascading impacts they have follow you. I'm not suggesting this piece is mutually exclusive with the autonomy of running your own firm -- I think you can do it regardless and you can do it now.

* The resources that worked for me include the YT channel "therapy in a nut shell." She has 2 playlists. One is how to regulate and process emotions. The second is anxiety specifically.

There's lots of other resources but these two helped. Here's sort of the synopsis. 

* Emotional regulation is a learned skill; many have been inadvertently taught to ignore/stifle/avoid emotions. 
* There's a biological cost/result if you stifle/avoid your emotions; it makes you physiologically more likely to be more anxious
* The solution is easy and very freeing

The logical part of me thinks that you're replacing one set of problems with another. But you're not reducing the problems.

>I’m hoping that someone might see this and will relate with their own experience. Anyways, thanks for reading this far.

I worked for a somewhat toxic firm, but I think my experience seems similar to my classmates. It's the "sink or swim" training methodology combined with the "up or out" so you're constantly proving yourself. There's no real job security so it was easy to give into the constant anxiety. 

I had learned a bit more about the physiological impacts -- and solutions to control -- anxiety for the bar exam. I pushed them away for the billable hour, but brought them back when I was just constantly inflammed and burnt out. 

On top of the anxiety lessons, I also learned that getting a productivity schedule also helped me feel a sense of control. I use pomodoro -- you basically block your time and do 1 task in that block. You do as much as you can and then you stop at the end of your timer. It takes a while to figure out how to chain them together and how to break up your assignments. But, you never miss an appointment on your calendar. So, using that logic, you can just knock out assignments that way. 

Then I also learned the huge impact and benefit of getting 8 hours of restful sleep. After controlling for medical issues (e.g., sleep apnea is

I’d say about 75% of the CLEs I attend are worthwhile. I figure if I learn a single new thing that will provide a marginal gain in my cases, that is a huge benefit averaged over time of all my cases. 

I work only contingent fee. Contingent fees (and flat fees) incentivize efficient use of time. Hourly rates incentivize using time.

I’d also encourage you to ask around at the CLEs you do go to, your own network, and national org listserv  what those folks are finding helpful. Then use your own judgment.

> I am experiencing something very similar. I have been fruitlessly searching for a decent paying position in Office Administration, so when I was invited via text message to interview with Adam Marshall at K&L Gates I was super pumped. It did seem too good to be true, for instance they asked me what I would require for payment and I said around $23 an hour, with $19 being my lowest that I could accept. He responded that the job pays $30.19 an hour and it is remote! I was thrilled, but still wary. He did a full interview, all on Teams, with 13 questions including 3 references and their contact info, so I may have just screwed 2 people I used to work with along with my best friend by giving the scam artist their phone numbers!! Next he said I needed to wait for a check he was sending by snail mail, then stopped and sent another text message stating that the accounting department just informed him that it would need to be sent to me through my email instead. Very quickly after getting "hired by his superiors", who supposedly reviewed my resume and my answers to the questions asked in the fake interview, I received the email with a check for $2,390.00 to be given to the serviceman who came to hook up my new equipment, including a very fast HP computer. I was over at my mother's house by this time, and we just kept looking at one another like, "What the Hell? Can this be for real? Who sends a two thousand dollar check to someone they have literally never even spoken to on the phone?" Next, I was instructed to capture a screenshot of the mobile deposit and send it for the accounting department's records. I did what he asked, except instead of a screenshot (another red flag, no banking app will allow you to take screenshots of your accounts in any way, shape, or form. DUH.), I used my son's camera to capture JUST the deposit info, none of my account info, thankfully. By this time I was beyond suspicious, and when I sent him the message with the fake deposit, he asked me to check and see if the funds were available yet. Hmmmmm, he works for a multi-million dollar company and he is worried about whether the funds are available? Although my bank did make some of the funds available right  away (only $500 of it, oddly enough), I lied and said they were still pending, at which point he instructed me to report to Teams (and him) at 8am tomorrow morning. All of this was happening after work hours, in fact I just finished the process at about midnight, which made it much more difficult because I cannot call K&L Gates and ask for the Human Resources department, or anyone else for that matter since all businesses are closed! Smart thinking on the scammer's part! The really sick part is he told me to "STAY BLESSED" after I said 'have a good night' to him. We have no money, I am a 50-year-old single mom of 5 trying to finish my degree, and it is impossible to get a job that pays decently AND that I am qualified for.

> This will always be specific to the firm. No one here can give you a reliable answer. For example, my firm allows you to enter non-billable time when doing anything that benefits the firm but doesn't get billed to a client. That includes CLE, pro bono, training, etc. But at the same time, using non-billable time is only intended to explain what you did with your day of you aren't meeting goals - it's to help us see if there's a problem. Once an attorney consistently meets goal, they stop entering non-billable time, because no one cares. Your firm may approach it differently. 

In other words, this is something you have to ask your firm. If you don't want to go to the boss, ask a senior associate or the office manager.

### r/LawFirm — 2023-10-05 | 25pts | `churn_billing`

> As everyone says, bill contemporaneously and bill all those emails as .1s and up.  

Billing is the work, not the outcome. I might need to pull a case file or look up a docket or find the judges opinion to answer an email like “Our motion is due by X date.” It’s a seven word email but it might have taken me 30 min to get there.  Bill 0.5, not 0.1. For this I use “attention to and email correspondence regarding XYZ.”

Billing is not a speed chess clock. I used to feel like I needed to stop my clock any time I put my pencil down. As long as your brain is focused on the task, keep billing. Mulling over how to deal with a bad case while you grab coffee? That’s fine to bill. If you stop to chat with someone, obviously don’t bill that. Also don’t bill if you’re randomly thinking about the case while driving or in the shower - I have seen weirdos on here who say they bill for that.  If you’re legit practicing your oral argument in the bathroom mirror, go ahead and bill for that. 

Finally - others might disagree - but when you’re junior don’t worry TOO much about arbitrary billing limits. Junior people often hear “spend an hour” when they get an assignment. Unless the partner is a total ass, they will be much happier with you if you give them good work product or research and bill 1.5 or 1.9, rather then delivering your half baked westlaw project after exactly one hour. This is also where people eat their own time.  I’ve been doing this for more than 10 years and unless the answer is literally my very first google result, it takes me more than an hour to look shit up. Even if it’s just confirming that the first google result was, in fact, correct.  

If you realize that you’ll need to completely blow your time deadline, just speak up. “Yes I can do that but I think it might require a little longer than X hours.” EVERYTHING takes longer than you think it will. Looking at you, boring as fuck objections and responses to discovery requests. 

Last last, even if you’re slammed, do 15 minutes of research immediately after you get a new assignment.  Partners get pissed off if you ask them extremely basic questions on an assignment they gave you days ago. “Uh what jurisdiction is this in?”

### r/LawFirm — 2023-09-01 | 3pts | `general`

> I had a lot typed out but realized I was overcomplicating things unnecessarily.

The goal is to save time attorney time and interruptions on client intakes. The solutions depend on a lot of information we don't have such as your area of practice, average intake call time, conversion rate, and conversion value. Regardless, here are some ideas:

How often does a conflict check done by the attorney result in finding a conflict? If it's often, that needs to be done by support staff to eliminate those wasted attorney calls.

How long does the average intake call take? The goal is to reduce that time without reducing your conversion rate. It seems an easy way to do this is to stop letting potential clients who just want to rant waste your time. Figure out some lines relevant your type of work that can be used to escape clients who want to waste your time.

Another idea to save intake time is to make an intake questionnaire to standardize the important questions you need answered to assess the case. If the ranters want to rant, then: "the details of your case are always important but I want to get some basic information first so I can contextualize those details." Then, by the the time it's their turn to rant, you already know if their case is crap or not. If they have no case you politely end the call after sympathizing the brief ranting you allow them using the lines from above. If it's a good case you let them rant as long as they want.

You have 5 attorneys doing intake calls who don't want to be interrupted throughout the day? There are 5 days in the week. Assign each attorney to a day (rotating schedule to account for holidays and busier days if need be). The lead attorney handles intake calls on their given day. I would avoid assigning a backup attorney as 10 consults should not be taking 8 hours and clients can wait 30 minutes for a call back on occasions where it's needed. Unless that impacts conversion, but I doubt it will.

The best system is probably to have one attorney handle all the intakes. Doing intakes is a skill that can be developed such that you can minimize time taken to make the potential client feel heard, convert more potential clients, and set good expectations for the potential clients who become actual clients. The more someone focuses on it the better the results will be.

> Finally, THE question I'm qualified to answer! My life has been leading up to this moment. I'm going to drone on a little here...  
  
I left ATC to become a lawyer. I'm obviously a lot older than you; my first day at the academy was in 1982 on the one-year anniversary of the PATCO strike, and I too was a controller in LA, ending up at what used to be LA TRACON on Imperial Highway. I was an excellent controller but frustrated with the culture.  
  
I graduated from a great law school two months after my 40th birthday and found that being a 40-year-old lawyer with no legal experience was not something that anybody was interested in. When I left the FAA, I was married with two preschoolers, and after putting all of us through the ordeal of getting a law degree, to find myself unattractive to employers was crushing. I've now been practicing for 25 years or so and although there was a sweet spot in there where I had enough experience and was young enough to be an attractive hire, I'm now in a position where my LinkedIn profile picture says that I'm too old even though my experience blows away a job description. I'm competing against other people with 25 years of experience who aren't even 50. I want work but I'm having trouble finding it.  
  
Hindsight being 20/20 I would have been better off sticking with ATC until retirement. I would have retired 15 years ago, my FAA retirement would have been higher than my salary as a lawyer is right now (which is the most absurd part of the entire exercise), and honestly, it turns out that I really enjoyed working the ATC problems every day. There are intangibles that still make me glad I left--I'm well respected in the field in which I work, I stopped drinking, and I became 95% less of an asshole than I was back then. But man, it's tough. Although, at your age, getting hired as a prosecutor is more likely than being hired at a firm and you'll want to look at Assistant US Attorney positions to see if your FAA time will go toward your federal retirement from the DOJ. But don't think for a minute that you're going to stop waking up every morning and thinking, "This is unsustainable," just because you stopped being a controller.   
  
Don't sell yourself short in your current career. If you're good at your job and empathetic, you ARE helping people. You've forgotten that what you're doing so effortlessly is quite an amazing thing, and it's OK to bask in that a little. It's impossible to see it from where you sit, but you're making a huge difference in people's lives.  
  
I live in a city with a population of over a million. Although LA County pays much better, the pay range for a city/county prosecutor here is $88K to $118K and the average home price last month was $1.3 million. Be really honest with yourself as you go down this road.

Monitor how the firm operates the business end of things. Accounting, IOLTA, payroll, hiring/firing, support staff, etc.

Don't do partners, unless you're the worst one there. Even then, don't do partners.

Monitor how the firm manages litigation files. Forms, software, procedures, etc.

If you can, try to create bridges with reputable PI firms. You'll know, rather quickly, how things are done from the other side, and which firms do things correctly and which firms skate. Once you switch teams, you'll have built in contacts to help you.

If you're at a ID mill, you will gain valuable insights. You'll know how to run a law office. Note what's working and what's not working AND WRITE IT DOWN. You'll see, first hand, people getting in their own way. Notate the traps and WRITE IT DOWN. No one wants to be dysfunctional, and many times they don't realize it or see it happen. And it will happen to you. But, you had the benefit of seeing another firm go through stuff from an outsider's perspective.

You'll also get practical experience on how to operate as a business. Though the models are wildly different, the core is the same. You'll learn about accounting, hiring / firing, firm administration, role of paralegals, etc. Take copious notes. 

As a PI lawyer, you won't bill for time (usually), so your relationship with billable hours and money will be vastly different, and will take a LOT of getting used to. With ID, every second has to be billed and accounted for. With PI, you're spending lots of time vetting cases. And you'll work up tons of cases that fizzle out. If that happens in an hourly shop, you're screwed. It's just part of PI life. A lot of lawyers cannot fathom that.

The main issue with PI: can you make it rain? Do you know how to market? Do you know how to drum up business? NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT SALES. You can be Clarence Darrow of modern litigation. You'll be broke if you can't make the phone ring.

The second issue with PI: Do you have the money to float? Do you have the cash flow to support a case pipeline? Do you have access to capital? You can have all the cases and skills in the world. If you can't finance a case through appeal, you'll still be broke.

The third issue with PI: Do you know how to handle cash flow? If you're a spender, you'll have problems. If you don't know finance, you'll have problems. If you don't understand how a war chest works, you'll have problems. PI work is feast AND famine. You'll have fat months and lean months. If you spend everything in a fat month, you're out of business for the inevitable lean month. If you don't have the ability to save for a rainy day, don't do this. PI cases are seeds. You can plant quite a few, some won't germinate, some will. The ones that do might survive to produce fruit, some won't. The ones tha

If you want to find out what microaggressions are lots of people have done blogs and videos we can use our energy and time to research, rather than making it OPs responsibility. Heck, make your own post and ask the question if you want a chat about it, that way people who have the time and energy can choose to engage with you if they like.

> I'm also in FL and can answer some of these. You probably already know you absolutely must have a separate trust/IOTA account.

Here's how our intake/trust/invoicing goes:

Intake coordinator collects consultation fee and schedules consult call. You may initially do some free consultation calls in order to build the business, but after a while, you'll get better clients by requiring a fixed payment for consultation. No one gets a consult with an attorney in our office without having paid for it before it gets scheduled.

After consult call, prospective client decides to retain. Intake coordinator sends engagement agreement which includes our billing practices, and a payment link for the deposit we require before starting any work.

Client signs engagement letter and pays deposit to trust.

We do the work.

We bill the work, monthly. For hourly work, client must pay the bill, and their original deposit remains in our trust account until (a) an invoice payment is missed, or (b) we've completed the work, if it's a finite thing (prepare operating agreement, quit claim deed, etc), or (c) the client terminates representation. For ongoing general counsel matters, we're holding these deposits continuously unless a payment is missed or client terminates, or for litigation holding it until the litigation is over. If a payment is missed, we apply the trust deposit and transactional work stops until any remaining balance is paid AND the trust deposit is replenished. For litigation, work can't always stop, of course, so the deposit has to be sufficient. This procedure is in our engagement agreement that they sign at the time of paying the deposit.

For fixed fee work (e.g. estate planning), we collect the fees up front in trust, and we apply those trust dollars to the invoice once the work is complete. It's not held continuously like for hourly work.

Expenses like postage, filing fees, are put on firm credit card and paid out of operating, and listed as an expense on the client's invoice for reimbursement.

Paying self is direct deposit from operating, with appropriate tax treatment. We use Gusto for payroll.

### r/agency — 2026-01-14 | 1pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> If you're looking at where the money is actually made (or lost), it usually comes down to two specific areas of friction: **Administrative Lag** and **Response Latency.**

# 1. Contract/SOW Generation (Eliminating the "Drafting" Tax)

Most agencies let deals go cold because it takes 48 hours to "get the paperwork together."

* **The ROI:** You can move from a "Discovery Call" to a "Signed SOW" in under 30 minutes.
* **The System:** Use a tool (like Fireflies) to record the call. That transcript is fed into an LLM with your SOW template. It extracts the deliverables, pricing, and timelines discussed and pushes them into a draft in your CRM. Client get one link to sign contract, pay invoice
* **Result:** You aren't "writing" anymore; you're just "approving/correcting." That saves roughly 2–4 hours of high-level management time per lead.
* Ditch the hyped "AI agent" build. Use workflows. You need automations that give you ROI, not burn money on maintenance. Use local hosted tools for 7 USD / month like n8n 

# 2. Omnichannel Speed-to-Lead (The 5-Minute Rule)

Data shows that if you don't respond within 5 minutes, your odds of qualifying a lead drop by **80%**. In 2026, leads are hitting you on IG DMs, WhatsApp, Email, and site bots simultaneously.

* **The ROI:** It’s impossible to staff a human on every channel 24/7. Automating the *initial* triage ensures no lead feels ignored.
* **The System:** Use an aggregator (like Manychat + n8n ) to pipe all channels into one "AI Dispatcher." The bot acknowledges the lead, answers basic FAQs based on your past data, and-most importantly-books the meeting.
* **Result:** You stop losing revenue to competitors who simply picked up the phone faster.
* Make the bot self learn, by providing it human feedback. each day, give it feedback for how it replied. Store these in a vector database. Next days, the bot will reply very close to what you just told it

# 3. High-Value "Intent" Scrapes

Forget bulk scraping. The real ROI is in **Event-Based Marketing.** \* **The System:** Set up a scraper to monitor local news or trade journals for specific triggers (e.g., a mall announcing a new renovation or a major tenant exit).

* **The Pitch:** Your outreach isn't "Hi, we do marketing." It’s "I saw you’re losing your anchor tenant in June; here is how we’ve helped other malls fill that footfall gap."
* **Result:** High-signal outreach that gets a 10x higher response rate than standard cold email.
* You ca read all the news, filter out your ideal ICP, with cheap scrapers from marketplaces like apify

### r/agency — 2026-01-08 | 1pts | `pricing`

> Sorry just been back through the questions and realised I missed this - answers below:

1. At the beginning we just did PPC, we then added SEO, and then Paid Social. At that time we had the channel people managing the client relationships directly rather than having Account Managers. That worked well because the client had direct access to the person delivering the work, but it stopped working when we got bigger and we had clients where we were delivering big complex campaigns. We then hired a team of Account Managers / Account Directors. Account Managers / Account Directors maybe managed 10 clients each, although that would involve a few large clients that took up lots of time and some other smaller clients that were more light touch.

2. Pricing was always based on what we needed to charge in order to make the business profitable, taking into account our staff and overheads. We obviously sense-checked this against what we knew competitors were charging, but since all agencies pay similar salaries and have similar overheads, we were always roughly in line with the market. Pricing increased as we grew in size and our overheads increased, plus we were benchmarking ourselves against different competitors.

3. Our tech stack was Salesforce for sales / CRM (also used Sales Navigator and Apollo for lead gen), [Funnel.io](http://Funnel.io) & Tableau for reporting, and then we built custom tools for time-tracking / campaign management / invoicing.

> I’ve seen those offers a lot. “First page or money back” is usually a red flag, not a flex.

Here’s why:

* “First page” means nothing without the keyword. They can rank you for some random long-tail term with 5–10 searches/month and technically “win.”
* No one controls Google. Even good SEOs can’t guarantee positions. Algorithms change, competitors move, SERPs get crowded with ads / maps / AI answers.
* The guarantee creates bad incentives. Most of the time they either:
   * go after junk keywords
   * use sketchy link tactics to spike rankings short-term
   * or define “first page” in a way that protects them, not you

If you’re still considering one of these agencies, this is how I’d vet them.

# Questions they must answer clearly

1. Which exact keywords are included? (With search volume + intent.)
2. What if ads/maps/AI push organic down? (Do they care about clicks or just rank screenshots?)
3. What’s the link strategy? (“We have our own network” = run.)
4. What do I actually get each month? (Tech fixes, content shipped, links earned, etc.)
5. How do you define success? (Leads/revenue > rankings.)
6. Do you have case studies in a similar niche? (Real numbers, not pretty graphs.)
7. Who owns the assets if we stop? (Content, links, accounts should be yours.)

# What a legit SEO pitch usually sounds like

Not “page 1 guaranteed.”

More like:

* “We’ll grow qualified organic traffic and leads.”
* “We’ll target these clusters, publish X pages, fix these issues.”
* “You’ll see early signals in 30–60 days, real results in 3–6 months.”

# About the $900–$1200/mo for 12 months

Not impossible, but usually means:

* very templated work
* heavy outsourcing
* or chasing easy wins that look good on reports, not revenue

If you want, drop one of their proposals here (blur names if needed) + your niche/market, and I’ll tell you what’s legit and what’s BS in about 5 minutes.

### r/agency — 2025-12-02 | 1pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> I see a lot of opinionated debate here, so I'm gonna jump in with some hard data, because the numbers actually support both of your stances to some extent.

For reference, we've run cold email for ourselves as well as dozens of clients over the past few years (some industry leading brands). At our peak, we were sending about 100k cold emails/month per client.

It is a canonical FACT that, over the last 5-10 years, cold email has experienced:

1. Increasing saturation
2. Decreasing ROI

We measured our **MSMB (Messages Sent to Meeting Booked)** rate over the past 5 years. The reason we use this as a north star metric is that, if you know your:

1. Sending Costs  
2. Close Rate  
3. LTV

you can easily calculate your overall ROI using your MSMB.

(Side note: Reply rate and open rate are vanity metrics. Anyone flexing a "high reply rate" usually doesn't know what they're talking about, in the same way that a media buyer flexing CPC over ROAS is likely inexperienced).

Over the past 5 years, MSMB has steadily worsened with the following trajectory:

* **2021 and before:** Avg \~50 emails to book 1 meeting.
* **2022:** Avg \~150 emails.
* **Early 2023:** Avg \~300.
* **Late 2023:** Avg \~1,000.
* **Early 2024:** Avg \~3,000.
* **Late 2024 and after:** Range 2,500 - Infinity. (We literally had clients send 25k emails with zero bookings).

So, if your cold outbound system has:

1. The ability to send massive volume for a low cost
2. A large TAM (total addressable market)
3. A completely untapped product-market fit

You can still make it work in 2025. The reality, however, is that fewer than 1/10 businesses have this right now.

We actually had clients profitably spending $50k+/month on Facebook ads who couldn't get a single booked meeting after 25,000+ cold emails.

Given the decreasing trust from sophisticated B2B prospects, we stopped fighting the inbox and started optimizing for Answer Engines/LLMs.

Internally, we call this building a "Semantic Trust Graph."

Basically, the goal is to structure data across high-authority nodes (Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, YouTube, etc) so that when a user asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a vendor, our clients are the cited answer.

And, given how the LLMs are now, you can actually start ranking within just a couple weeks (good for the new guys).

So yeah, cold email isn't 100% useless, but unless you have unicorn-like product-market fit in a totally unsaturated industry, it’s becoming like having a billboard in the desert.

> The indirect route works better for us - about 3x better conversion rates than direct pitching. 

Our process evolved a lot over time. We start with value-first content (case studies, guides) that naturally leads to a "learn more" CTA. From there, we use a quick qualification form that feeds into an automated follow-up sequence. This gives prospects time to research on their own terms while staying top of mind.

We actually built voice agents to handle the follow-up calls automatically - they qualify, answer FAQs, and book meetings without the awkward sales pressure. Booking rates jumped from \~4% to \~12% when we stopped trying to force immediate calls and let the automation nurture consistently.

The key insight was that most prospects need 5-7 touchpoints before they're ready, but sales teams often give up after 2-3.

> Hi! I've worked in marketing for almost ten years, and now I work at an AI tech company, Botpress, for AI agents and automating workflows. So this is easily one of my favourite topics.

Marketing is broad and can have so many applications, and there are so many ways AI can help.

We’ve deployed hundreds of thousands of chatbots, so this is my area of expertise. The most common use cases are AI lead generation or customer support bots. But conversational AI can handle almost anything, both internal and external. 

The main reasons people use chatbots, is for:  
\- Lead generation. It's an easy bonus of any chatbot, and it can really streamline the process.  
\- 24/7 customer support  
\- Multilingual support, providing responses in multiple languages, adapting to the user’s preferred communication style  
\- Data collection, chatbots quietly gather details like what customers want, what they’re asking, and how they interact  
\- Customer or staff onboarding. A chatbot can provide tutorials, address common concerns and answer FAQs  
\- Digital business development representatives. Chatbots qualify leads by asking key questions, segmenting users, and passing warm prospects to the sales team  
\- Gathering feedback and reviews. Chatbots can prompt users for reviews or surveys after specific interactions,  
\- Simplified event promotion, having a chatbot there to answer FAQs, share registration links, and send reminders.

Our marketing team uses bots and AI agents to:  
\- Analyze competitor websites and provide competitive intelligence  
\- Send personalized follow-up emails  
\- Analyze product signals to suggest who is ready for an upgrade



Also, you can use machine learning (the use of algorithms that learm from data to automate, optimize, and personalize) for:

\- Personalized content, on the homepage or category pages, add ons in the cart, which emails a customer receives, or personalize email content based on behaviour, recommending which product should appear in a dynamic block for each person.  
\- Email marketing, to predict open rates, and optimize send times, subject lines, or content variations.  
\- Predictive analytics. Once trained, the model can score new leads, campaigns, or customers in real time based on how closely they match past success signals.  
\- Customer segmentation, grouping people by behaviour rather than demographic. Such as by browsing patterns or purchase frequency.  
\- Churn prediction, to flag which customers are likely to disappear by learning from past behaviour, like drops in usage, skipped renewals, or slow response times before someone leaves.   
\- Ad targeting and optimization, steering your funds towards winning combos.  
\- Sentiment analysis, it can process massive volumes of open-text feedback from places like reviews, support chats, or social media, and label it with nuanced emotional or intent-based categories.

Honestly, I could write a book on this, so I'll stop here.  
Needless to say, I am a huge

The weirdest one for me is people that ask for help saying they have been struggling to get their business started and are stuck. They ask for help then reveal they need help with their website homepage copy.

> I think it mainly depends on what you and your team actually NEED, and what you need the software to do. I have worked in many industries that are very disconnected with little overlap, but almost every single business activity boils down to CRUD: you need a database you can Create, Read, Update and Delete from. Virtually every program and game, etc.; that we use is some kind of abstraction of an "interactive table(s)". For 20+ years I have always had the same job, roughly (outside my forays into other weird work), and that is essentially "make a highly specific and proprietary CRUD".

Customers? Appointments? Installs? Leads? These are all just tables of data and the interplay between them is what can give projects life. Obviously, this is not something you can just whip out if you do not have the skill set which is okay, I am just explaining this in the hopes that maybe you can look at your own processes and see what exactly you need.

The thing that I feel is really insidious about stuff like GHL is when it is also sold as being able to generate leads/sales or do proper lead nurturing. In both cases, they require more resources to get dumped in (advertising dollars in the first, and proper workflows/automations in the second). It isn't that you can't use GHL in any capacity: just that you would light-years ahead of most of your competition if you properly knew what it was and what it was **not** capable of, coupled with what exactly your team needs on a day-to-day basis.

There are also lots of alternatives and that SaaS space is absolutely flooded with options. Invariably, they will all have some shortcomings. Their own pros and cons. Some employees will want (Software Y) they used at their last company and not (Software X) that you end up choosing, which is also inevitable, so it is important to avoid a secondary trap of constantly searching for a solution and thinking that, just beyond the horizon, an oasis awaits. It is always a mirage.

I look at the process (in solar) like this: you have or generate a lead that is interested -> an appointment setter or the sales rep directly gets in contact with them virtually or ideally at their house -> management tracks these interactions very granular to watch for hiccups -> hopefully the deal converts (customer signs) and heads to your installer or you do the install and continue down the process further with customer retention/service, etc.;

The hardest part is the first step. You might end up having to dump a lot of uneasy money into various marketing. The internet does not operate the same way it did even a year ago: SEO got massively disrupted by AI, for example, and advertisements in **any** industry can be a crapshoot (even with highly skilled marketing teams and near limitless budgets). 

This whole process can be done on a spreadsheet and a lot of companies end up there, with mountains of spreadsheets everywhere (which doesn't scale very well and can be terrifying from a security standpoint

> There are a few schools of thought on finding out, or not finding out the budget. In a way, the price is the price regardless of how much they have to pay for it. On the other hand, if you want or need the work then you will likely be willing to fit your price into whatever constraints they put on you. Some people have strong arguments on one way of thinking about their budget or the other. Personally, if I can get the budget then I prefer to know the budget. 

So, if you haven't already, ask what them for the budget. There's nothing wrong with asking, and if you don't then you're flying blind. I sometimes use that analogy if someone wants a car, you need to know some details before you can point them in the right direction. New or used, low end or high end, features, etc. A car will get you there and back, but it could be a used Kia or a top in lambo. Apply that example to their project, a Shopify is not like all others, right? What will their budget allow in terms of bells, whistles, options, training, etc? If they have a small budget, you'll propose just the basics. If they have a large budget then you'll give them everything. 

Ask to speak to the client. If the design company won't allow it then it's a huge red flag. I long ago stopped working for intermediaries. It never worked out because you're answering to multiple parties, and in the end your client's client, who you don't have contact with, is the decision maker. That's a terrible situation to be in. And also, the intermediary can unilaterally cut you out whenever they want. You want contact, and a contract, with the end-client. If you can't get that and you still want to pursue the deal then you have risk that you should account for in your pricing. 

I like the idea of pricing in a set number of hours for support and training. Even better, be explicit about how many hours and what they get when you write your proposal and contract. Be sure to include in your proposal what your rate is for additional support and training, as well as for change orders. (they always want changes)

RE: bumping your cost to come up with the price. Are you adding any value to the project? Are you providing project management, scope management, communications, training, funding (you pay your dev before you get paid), etc? If so, include your time and liabilities in addition to the markup on your outsourced costs. Don't forget to pay yourself!

Before marking up the price, be sure to identify and quantify the risks of the project. The more risks you can account for, the better. So instead of arbitrarily slapping 40% on the developer's cost, first ensure that all your risks are accounted for in the price, then mark up on top of that for your profit. Shoot, 40% may be too low of a number. Where did you come up with that? Personally, I prefer to 2x to 3x my outsource direct costs because I have a shit ton of other expenses to account for besides just the COGS. 

Even better is to not price based on your cost. I

> Lots of useful feedback already.
I'll focus on the copy / value proposition.

Headline, subheadline, first paragraph or bullets and CTA should answer these questions:
What is it?
Who is it for and what's in it for them?
What should they do next?
See the basecamp.com home page for example. 

Also 
Do you build all types of software (unlikely), so specifically state the type / category of software and apps you build.
Who do you serve, marketing agencies if so say it.
"All-in-one" sounds inappropriate for a service, maybe something like "One-stop-shop"?

I expected to see more on:
- "How it works"? Ie the offer.
- how this compares to say hiring a full-time developer or developers in-house. Make it a no-brainer if you compare the 2 scenarios.

> I had good luck with my 1-man software MVP factory last year - was able to spin up some super impressive MVPs for a ton of clients (from clean tech startups to international peace keeping orgs) using new tech stacks such as TailwindUI, Supabase, Next.js, and APIs in Node.js or Python/FastAPI. 

Having GPT/Phind.com searching documentation for me and helping me to answer (easy!) tasks, especially around backend tasks, kept things fast. Could churn out 1 MVP a month easy, 2 at a deadly push.

Got to $19k MRR pretty quickly, and knowing the budgets in the US for MVPs with this tech stack, was aware it could have got to $100k MRR if I was a little wiser. I had very strong contracts with the clients I built MVPs for - but got completely shafted by 1 partnership agreement in particular that I signed, when I began working as the Fractional CTO for other agencies. 6 months of friendly fire caused me to stop customer acquisition, wind down to just 1 client on retainer, and pause to think.

Fixed price and fixed scope are great - especially when you have a tool to sort it out for you (I built my own tool for this, which works wonders. Basically an automated contract negotiator!) However the other piece needs is to have an efficient, zero-time solution around QA/testing - to validate that your fixed scope work is completed. 

1 unreasonable (generally non-technical, without budget) client that one of your partner agencies lets in - especially if they’re buddies - can run amok with what seems like a reasonable partnership agreement. 

Having end-to-end testing scripts to hand that can confirm - for 99% of users - that the terms of the contract has been met, and the current wishlist is for backlog/maintenancd given the scope of an MVP (keep defining and reiterating this, repeatedly) - is critical. Best to write them yourself - but as a quick extension, would also consider using the service over at octomind.dev for quick AI E2E testing. They’re still very much WIP, but if I pile fuel on the fire in the future, they’ll like be ready at that time!

Or just dictate terms in any partnership agreement upfront. Or just own all of the client relationships yourself, and aggressively refund and terminate any clients that show a slew of red flags.

Firstly, I want to thank you, not many people are willing to help me there, but let's get straight into it.  
My offer is running Meta & Twitter ads with a guarantee of money back.  
My niche is Health & Beauty. I mainly reach out to plastic surgery, dental clinics, and skincare brands.  Planning on either trying the martial arts equipment or the insurance nieche.   
Is any of these a good idea? Should I ditch them all and think of a new one? If yes, have you got any idea?  
My outreach methods -  
Sending an email to a brand, ( Have 4 templates they will be included down below ) and wait for an answer. I've seen that you recommended that I shouldn't use my domain email, so I do 50% domain and 50% Gmail. Wait 2-3 weeks and message the brand on Instagram. ( I will try to reach the owners now that you recommended too ). I have sent out about 550 cold emails now, but I got about 5 responses and none of them wanted to go through with anything. I have messaged about 400 brands on Instagram, and the results are way better there. About 1 in 25 brands are interested in my proposition, but after I explain it to them, they just stop answering. This is the furthest I got in half a year.  
I would try cold calling, but that isn't really an option for me. Where I live, it is insanely expensive to call numbers in the US and the UK.  
I also post on Instagram, would you mind checking it? @ kaloroadvertising  
I use snov.io, Hunter, and Anymailfinder to find emails. A lot of times I can only find info, support, etc. kind of mail. Should I even message those emails? Is there any point of that?  
This is everything I have for now. I know it is a lot, but I would be really grateful if you could help me with any of these.

> It'll try answer both your questions with a model we now use.

Tracking time and trying to achieve a maximum billable rate per head count is where most agencies start. However, soon it becomes a trap for managers. Focusing only at these two metrics (billable hours &amp; utilisation rates) limits the agency to increase its annual revenue. Because if the agency wants to increase its revenue, it has to increase headcount (to have more billable hours to sell to clients) - which is not always sustainable as you may not be able to control the work (i.e., clients may slow down spend etc.).

In the first 7 years of my agency, billable time and utilisation was a focus - we initially targeted 90% and quickly realised that wouldn't work (for reasons you have mentioned). We then targeted 80% per production headcount (6 hours per day) with a view to have 60% utilised across all productions staff on average.  In this model, timesheets was still key and it is important to remember that you can't simply KPI/performance manage staff on achieving 6 billable hours a day if they have no control in selling work to clients. Our Account / Strategy team focused on revenue (sale of hours), and our production team focus on delivery (utilisation and quality). For projects, we created detailed scope documentation (pages and pages of functional spec - which the client rarely read in full), granular estimates for each task, and fixed plans to a deadline date - all of which caused tension each time client wanted to make a minor change.

Fast forward to last year, and we abandoned timesheets altogether. We also stopped tracking billable hours per staff (however, we still track utilisation rates). Now, the engagement is done using sprints (2 week cycle) where we look at the project objectives, features, stories, and do rough point estimation to say "We believe to achieve the project MVP requirement, it will take 6 sprints with 4 resources in each sprint". Clients have flexibility to adjust priorities of scope and we do frequent releases to showcase work (which client love seeing progress every 2 weeks). Our Project Management team use a resource/capacity booking system to track utilisation of staff against projects. This model increased utilisation, motivation and helped the team focus on a single large project. In between big projects, the production team may go to a BAU (business as usual) bench to help with small bits of work for other clients - all of which still uses a 2 week sprint cycles to manage.

From a revenue point of view, our Account / Strategy team focused on maximising utilisation  and we have a revenue target per month/quarter/year. But it also has its revenue limitations - as again, you're selling total headcount capacity in a sprint fashion. Last year we started moving our pricing model towards value based pricing. Rather than charging an hourly rate or per headcount per sprint rate, we analyse what value a project creates for our clients (in collaboration wit

> A bit late but I think these are some valuable points. honestly getting that feedback is a blessing in disguise. it sucks to hear but "you're hard to follow" is way better than people just nodding along while having zero clue what you mean.

the biggest reason people struggle with this is that they **think out loud.** you are basically taking your listener on the "behind the scenes" tour of your brain instead of just giving them the final product.

here is the actual toolkit for fixing this without sounding like a robot.

**1\. The PREP Method (this is literally the cheat code)** if you struggle with structure just use this for every single answer in a meeting. it forces you to say the most important thing first so people dont lose the plot.

*   **Point:** state the bottom line first. (ex: "i think we should delay the launch")
    
*   **Reason:** the "why" in one sentence. ("because the api is still buggy")
    
*   **Example:** one quick stat or story. ("last time we launched with bugs we lost 10% of users")
    
*   **Point:** restate the bottom line. ("so we should wait until monday")
    

**2\. Stop being afraid of silence** most people ramble because they are terrified of those 2 seconds of silence after they finish a sentence. they fill it with "um" and "uh" or they just keep talking to fill the air.

**the fix:** when you finish a thought just stop. even if it feels awkward. it actually makes you look way more confident and gives the other person time to process what you just said. if you feel like you need to keep talking literally just bite your tongue.

**3\. The "Record and Cringe" exercise** this is the part everyone hates but it works the fastest. record yourself explaining something for 60 seconds then listen to it back (I like to use an app called Confidently for this, it's in any app store. You get 2 random words and then you have to improvise while it analyzes your face and voice and then it gives you instant feedback on things like articulation, facial confidence and vocal confidence etc.) you will realize you say the same thing 3 times in different ways.

*   improvise a 60 second explanation
    
*   listen to it and check the articulation score
    
*   do it again and again
    
*   Over time you'll notice you naturally start formulating and talking more concisely because of new neuronal pathways.
    

**4\. The ELI5 Rule (Explain Like I'm 5)** if you cant explain it simply you dont actually understand it as well as you think you do. before a meeting ask yourself how you would explain this to a smart 10 year old. if you need 5 minutes of jargon to get to the point you already lost the room.

**5\. Write it out first** if youre in a meeting and you know youre gonna have to speak soon write down your "Point" on a sticky note in 5 words or less. keep your eyes on that note while you talk. it acts like a tether so you dont wander off into a 10 minute story about nothing.

**tl;dr:** stop thinking out loud. give the answer fi

> I just got put on this project in September 2024. I was recruited by a boutique firm to work with their client on a different project and the client hired me as a FTE. 

To answer your question, the company had alot of bloat in their ops, using different SaaS for each step in the process. At one point, I counted 7 SaaS apps. Each just doing one thing. I set them up with a different SaaS that could accomplish what 5 of them could do. With some additional customization,  we were able to automate customer acquisition, onboarding (with the occasional email for the ones that dont get it) , a new self-service portal, and hosting all of the customer snd regulatory reporting data on one platform. 

For each acquisition that we get, we still look at each one, but now the process doesn't spend hours per day processing each lead through serveral different platforms. Almost a one stop shop. We are pretty close to automating regulatory reporting requirements. We will now review a summary report with all required data. Print. Store in file. 

Of course, if something happens to this platform, we're fucked.

> Just an old retired consulting partner's perspective here. The whole case thing has gotten out of control. We always gave cases, but they were relatively simple and straightforward. They were mainly to test whether you understood basic concepts, could structure a process, could do some basic math in your head and approximate (not fall into the engineer trap of trying to be overly precise), and how well you dealt with some pressure and push-back. The idea was to understand how you would behave in front of a client and how you carried yourself.

Before retiring, I did recruiting at HBS, Booth, etc. as the cases matured and grew in length and complexity. I was always amazed at how "formulaic" responses became i.e., here's the part where they restate the problem and tell we what kind of case it is, here's the part where they say can I take a few moments to jot down some notes, here's the part where they look for some confirmation, etc. I'd often push back with comments like, "I don't buy that that is important, why do you think it is?" just to see how candidates react. Always amazed me how many people backed off when pressed, even when they were right. I also often asked tangential questions like, "I'm the client ... tell me why I should hire your firm to do this job?" Got a lot of deer in the headlights on that one, but it is fundamental.

Saw a deck from Booth's consulting club the other day that was 400 pages of case examples and tips on answering them. Maybe it's different when you're being interviewed by a more junior person, but if a partner's interviewing they are looking for how you are going to interact with a client, what personality type you are, and how well you are going to represent the firm. IMHO.

Of course, completely flubbing the case won't help you either ... 

To answer op's question ... if it's a growth problem stop thinking about how many different "frameworks" could apply. Pick what you think is salient, structure an approach to addressing the client's key issues, and have strength of conviction that you are right. Don't try and present the whole laundry list and look to me to tell you if the right one is in there or not.

Maybe I'm just getting old and the consulting industry isn't what it used to be ... Apologies for the old guy rant!

> I get this. I think the doubt is less about your capability and more about how the last 12 months have been set up to eat your confidence alive. You were asked to run without a harness: no training, poor marketing, zero budget, and the expectation that you both deliver and invent a repeatable GTM overnight. That will hollow anyone out.

A few practical things I would do, nothing dramatic, just work you can start today that rebuilds momentum and gives you something concrete to show:

Start with stories. Pick 3 client wins that actually mattered (renewals, cross-sells, a programme you rescued, a C-suite relationship that led to new work). For each: name the situation, what you did (not the team fluff), the measurable result ($$ value, % increase, retention uplift, timeline saved), and one short line about how you made it repeatable or scalable. These become interview answers, LinkedIn posts, and CV bullets, and they force you to see real impact instead of the fog of “I did a lot.”

You say you have always hit target. That’s gold. Turn it into structure: average deal size, sales cycle length, conversion rate from intro to win, number of accounts you reactivated, pipeline you owned at any point. Even rough numbers are useful. Hiring managers for BD roles want patterns not magic.

Build a 30–60–90 for a Head-of-BD role before you get the job. In interviews, present a concrete plan: how you would fix pipeline, what one process you’d change in 30 days, which hires you’d prioritise, a hypothesis for where to find quick early market wins. This shows you are already operating like a leader and not someone desperate to escape fee work.

Use your network like a market test. Tell three trusted clients and peers you are exploring leadership roles and ask two tactical questions: “If you were hiring a Head of BD, what woul you value most?” and “Who in your network should I speak with?” Those answers will both sharpen your pitch and surface warm intros.

Start a short, public signal: a 1–2 page one-pager on a sales play you ran or a client case study you own. Post a thoughtful LinkedIn note on a lesson learned (real and specific). The point is to create evidence you can point to when you feel the imposter voice.

Finally, practice the language of leadership! Move from “I sold this” to “I built the motion that produced X.” Leaders close deals and design repeatable systems. You already have the raw material (delivery credibility + client relationships). Frame it as system design and you stop sounding like a good seller and start sounding like someone who can scale a sales organisation.

IMO, you are closer than you think. The last year chewed up your confidence, but not your skill. If it helps, I touch on this exact transition (from being the rainmaker to building the machine) in [Beyond Slides](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr). Mostly because I saw so many people who could sell but struggled to sell themselves into leadership roles...

You have done the hardest bit: kept

> Good sales people always assume the sale. 

So the approach is to stay in the conversation and provide value for the things that can be answered quickly, which lets you show your quality and expertise. Deepen the conversation until it's clear that going further would require solving nuanced stuff, then the stage is set for asking to continue as a formal project.

Some comments here are going to be slightly off because of framing it as "sorry," like talking shop is offensive; or framing it passively like "I'd be happy to take that as a project," which is fine but it also sounds like you've stopped the conversation because you think there's a disconnect.

The approach is to assume they are asking you to help them. Because you have the ability to deliver, and they need this, so why wouldn't they want to generate value? To frame the mentality, think of when you stop for a refreshment in the summer, the vendor doesn't reply with sorry or "I'd be happy to help." They just assume you want a refreshment and talk to you like it's simply about figuring out what product to give you to best serve you. So you want to get into the conversation with a positive attitude and give value, and drive that conversation to the point that it feels like they clearly would benefit from a more dedicated effort and it's time to get more nuanced.

A lot of times, consultants fear if they say something savvy in a few minutes then the value they provide is gone. If all you have to give can be absorbed in a single conversation, whatever you were selling wasn't worth much anyway. IMO, be generous with giving value in conversation, because it amounts to very little without a proper process, and all it really does is position you better as a source of solutions and expertise. The vibe is: if I can blow your mind with a couple ideas in a 15 min conversation, imagine what I can do if you hire me to really get into this for you. So go ahead and blow their mind in a quick chat.

Here is a run that is closer to the bullseye:

"Yes, that's very interesting because we've been working on a similar project in the last few months and we ran into many of the same issues you are experiencing. We've worked out a few angles that are very useful and we are finding great progress, but it depends on various factors that we'd need to uncover further. I think pursuing this would be very meaningful for your organization. If you are ready to explore it further now, I can put together a project plan for us to work on this. It's going to be great."

Always Be Closing. Provide value, show unique expertise, show the complexity of the project, be excited about the project, confirm how valuable it is for them; once they are optimistic, assume the sale and ask for involvement.

If you give a bit of value away and there's no sale, you haven't lost anything, not even time. It's a marketing and sales investment. The process builds bridges and plants seeds. Someone that just wanted a quick help today might come

Changes only after the project is delivered in a second chance management project. It's definitely worth checking out a pm course somewhere like udemy. Speed read one, it'll help a lot. I used to keep a massively convoluted change request form handy. Anyone who tries to change the scope would get one with a request to fill it out for use in prepping a later project change.

> Over the past year, I transitioned out of consulting, aiming to move into a more operational and commercially focused role within tech, retail or FMCG. I had a few years of experience in consulting, and figured it would be a fairly quick pivot. It wasn’t. After 12 months, 53 applications, and a lot of interviews, I finally landed a role that fits both what I’m good at and what I actually want to do.

**Here’s what I learned along the way:**

* My **interview rate landed around 35%**, whether I sent tailored applications or applied in bulk. That taught me to stop obsessing over every line in my CV and instead focus on keeping up momentum and staying consistent over time.
* To help with that, I built a **ChatGPT assistant** that scanned job ads and auto-generated a tailored LaTeX CV, selecting the most relevant experiences and adapting the phrasing to match the role. It saved a ton of time and helped me scale my applications without compromising quality.
* I also used **ChatGPT’s voice mode** as a mock interview coach. I’d practice answering questions out loud, then ask for feedback on my tone, clarity, and structure. It helped me improve quickly and feel much more confident going into second and final rounds.
* First interviews are about s**howing curiosity, positivity, and that you’ve done your homework.** Being prepared and asking thoughtful questions consistently helped me move forward in the process more than preparing the perfect STAR-story.
* **Final rounds are all about your story and luck**. I only started converting when I could clearly explain why I was the obvious fit, connecting my background, my motivation for the role, and my long-term goals into one simple, coherent narrative.

I stopped by to mention Afforai for research. This is probably the last time I'll bring it up, but I've been using it intensely the last couple months for a research project and it's helped a lot. Afforai is a tool for academic researchers. It has an AI chat that's connected to Google Search and Google Scholar (academic papers). It's trained to answer in mini essays, so if you ask it a question it will go do research and come back with a mini report using sources. It's pretty neat. There's also a research organizer section for you to build your own library of sources. If you attach PDFs (it can sometimes help find them, or you just upload it yourself), then you can chat with the document or with a collection of documents, and it keeps separate track of your notes and AI chats with the documents. Also super neat, particularly when you are operating off formal research that is clunky in language and tens of pages long.

> The problem with this type of argument is the hang up on "thinking." I disagree that the robot can't think, but that's irrelevant. Intellect is about outcomes. 

If I need someone to verify the risk profile of a financial derivative using algorithmic methods, can you do it? OpenAI o1 can do it and is very good at it. Someone is getting hired to do this work, and my company doesn't care who it is as long as the output is solid. I'll pay a squirrel in nuts if it can do the calculation reliably. Humans and their brains don't have a monopoly on outcomes. 

The flaw of this argument is framing it as if humans "think" because they are able to reason their way to a good answer, and the others (robot, squirrel) don't think because they couldn't get to the answer. All these creatures can reason, the question is only if they have sufficient intelligence and knowledge to get to the answer using their own flavor of thinking techniques. The key concern is that human intellect is growing slowly, squirrel intellect is not growing in any meaningful way, but AI is growing its intellect exponentially with no sign of it stopping for the foreseeable future. 

OpenAI o1 today can already use its understanding of finance and math to assess risk by formulating a monte carlo algorithm in Python, then run and refine that algorithm until it yields a perfect result. And it can do that in 1 minute. If you think that's not "thinking," I'll respect your right to have an opinion, but when it comes to business outcomes, I simply don't concern myself with what you call what o1 just did. The outcome is what matters, and how efficiently and reliably it can do it. Inevitably, as AI gets more reliable, efficient and intelligent, it will be favored more and more across business outcomes.

Managing others:  
\- Trust .... Trust in them and their knowledge, you are managing, it does NOT imply that you are smarter than them or should know all they do....You are managing to take away their obstacles, clear the path, and provide support for THEIR opinions...

That's the super worst case scenario. Less financially bad scenarios are: maybe you're out of work for a year or two because you're laid off and the job search is hard. Maybe you take a lower paying job than your current role. Etc. Same question about these scenarios - can you guys make it work financially?

If the answer is "yes," then you're free. Work doesn't matter except for however much you want to care about the relationships with coworkers and pride in your work. Only you can decide how much to value those, but the first step is taking a step back and realize that you're probably not as shackled to the corporate world as you realize

Obviously I'm making a lot of assumptions about your financial situation which includes a lot of privilege that many of us have capitalized on, so if you're in a less fortunate situation, at least you can recognize that you gotta be in it for your family and use that to self motivate

> Day one:
- get the team started on no-brainer activities like booking expert calls, pulling secondary, etc. Anything interesting they see while doing this they should quickly throw on a slide 
- while they are doing that, write a bullet point storyline (one bullet per slide) based on the questions in the scope. One to three slides per question. For each slide state the tagline and enough description of the content you expect to see that a junior person will probably at least sorta do it right 
- pull the team back together mid day. Talk through your storyline, make sure each person sees where their work stream connects to it and what content they're responsible for. Get any slides anyone made as they did startup, talk about them with the team. 
- the team should be expected to improve the storyline with you as you talk it through 
- send storyline to the partner, verbally talk through it with them sometime on the first day 
- end of day deliverable from the team is a blank deck matching the storyline, with whatever content they've come across on the page (could just be a pasted chart to clean up later, or a random quote from an analyst report
- try to get 1-2 expert calls, join them personally so you learn dumb stuff like how to pronounce the names of the companies, and can get a hypothesis in your mind
- set up time with the direct partner in charge every day, and with the senior partner included two days before each client update.

Day two:
- when you wake up you should have a blank deck in your inbox from the team. Read through each page, make comments, edits, give guidance where the storyline was unclear. Call out what you expect at the end of the day - more quotes on this page, an initial market size page, whatever.
- when the team arrives they should have this marked up pack in their inbox. Talk it through with each of them 1:1, answer any questions, ask them for clarification, etc. Don't let them leave until they can describe to you specifically what they're going to go do. Make sure they understand that the instant things stop going as you've agreed, they need to come back to you for help.
- now the team should be good for a few hours. Use this time to handle process (scheduling, etc.), check in with the partner, and get smarter yourself (read the CIM more carefully, read a good market report, whatever)
- pull the team back together mid afternoon and talk through what each person has learned, how that changes the answer, and explicitly what they will deliver at the end of the day.
- brief the partner on the above
- go home, have dinner, touch grass
- check in with each team member remotely after dinner - make sure things are on track, get a firm commitment about what they'll send you and when. If the "when" is like 2am, pare back the work until they are doing something sane.
- the above cadence is what you'll repeat every day

This video creator has been life changing for, especially when it comes to her videos about productivity. 

Then watch this video as this methodology has changed my life. 

https://youtu.be/tT89OZ7TNwc?si=DmroQquAy-BCrmNl

My company uses Microsoft (MS), so I tag emails into one of those 4 quadrants on my MS To Do List. I've realized if I complete the 3-5 takes I MUST do each day, it allows me to stay organized, stay prioritized, and walk away from work care free. At 3PM, I stop, work on my list for the next day, add notes, attachments and write a brief description of what I need to do. Then I finish up anything I was going to work on for the next day marked important / not urgent. 

The more you stay on top of your list, the more it gives you the power to stay on top of things, stay organized, prioritized, and walk away from work. Even better, I don't immediately answer emails because they either fall into important / not urgent or urgent / not important. I've come to realize a lot of people make smoke but there's no fire. 

Hope that helps!

> I stopped wasting time on wrong AI tools 

I have tried using AI for literally everything, hoping they'd make my projects run smoother and faster. AI seemed like it would change the way we handle everyday tasks. But often, it just led to more confusion and didn't deliver what it promised. After navigating through this mess, I've learned which tools really work and which don't and this is really important to know that using the right tools can literally increase your productivity 10x.

Before you try to find any tools, there are some crucial things to keep in mind:

1. Understand the Value of Time-Saving: The first revelation came when I realized not all AI tools are designed to save time; some complicate simple tasks under the guise of advancement. It's crucial to identify tools that genuinely optimize your workflow.

2. Embrace Experimentation with Caution: Experimentation is vital, but it’s equally important to be critical. I learned this the hard way when an AI logo maker, despite its promises, required more manual tweaks than anticipated, turning "time-saving" into a time sink.

3. Seek Community Feedback: I started engaging more with forums and user reviews, which opened my eyes to real-world performances of these tools, beyond the flashy demos. Using discord channels and subreddit reviews can be pretty useful in this case.

4. Focus on Compatibility and Integration: The best tools are those that seamlessly integrate into existing workflows rather than requiring you to build around them. 

5. Prioritize Tools That Learn and Adapt: AI tools that adapt to user input and improve over time proved to be more beneficial, enhancing their utility with every use.

6. The Simplicity Factor: Often, the simplest tool provides the most value. A straightforward interface with powerful functionality beats a complex tool that promises the world but delivers an atlas instead.

### This Month’s Top AI Tools That Are Truly Useful:

- Uizard:  An AI-powered design tool that simplifies the process of turning ideas into designs and prototypes with a user-friendly interface 

- Replai: Optimizes social media engagement by analyzing posts and determining the best times for publishing to maximize visibility and interaction

- UseChannel: Asks questions in plain English and generates data-driven answers, acting like a personal data analyst 

- Dora AI: This tool allows you to design and publish 3D and animated websites using just plain text, transforming static designs into immersive experiences. Specially if you launching a new online business, this can be very powerful. 

- Lumiere3D: Tailored for e-commerce, this tool helps businesses create interactive 3D product visualizations for enhanced online customer experiences

> It can, but that’s a bit like saying “holes in the chest can come from knife wounds.” It is a source, but so are rabid animal attacks, gunshots, industrial accidents…

If you have ADHD, you are cycling around stimuli if you’re emulating holding a conversation. Much like looking up while driving and noticing you missed the light turning green, you put context together at the yellow light of silence and assume the conversation is over. Since they just stopped talking (your ADHD had you not paying attention when they said their half of closing pleasantries) you hit the gas to not sit through the red light of social graces.

Further, as someone with ADHD, one will be overeager to move to the next thing, and learning that other people do not think the same as “ourself” is a very common human challenge for every stripe; it’s natural that an ADHD person using them mirror neurons would conclude the other person feels the same way and thus wants to the point answers that don’t tax them (unaware this is not how it feels to the nonADHDer).

So now their technology is a Frankenstein monster of smaller solutions, and duct taped together. This makes proper implementations from a data engineering side near impossible, and as a result you get a very frustrating experience. That is further inhibited by the fact they place all their money into Marketing and not actually improving the product, product improvements are actually a cost center essentially as just having a feature is enough. The people who sign the contracts dont actually use the tool and just make product comparisons based on feature sets.

> I’ll try to give you a more direct answer. It’s hard to explain because we can do a lot of different shit, and with that we are not experts in anything.

Management consultants usually help companies understand where they are good at, where their customers see them adding value, how they compare against competitors, and where they can actually make money. In theory this should be the CEO’s job, but a lot of management teams are very narrow minded and can’t see outside of their own four walls. Lots of companies are still spending money on products that are losers because “that’s what we do”.

The way we do it is we look at a shit ton of market reports, talk to an immense amount of clients, competitors, industry experts and their own employees to try to understand market size and customer needs. After that we tell them where we think they should be and how we think they should approach the market, and if they do it right, which they not always do, we estimate how much money they can make. We also tell them where they are bad and should stop trying to invest. We talk a lot one because some consultants are only good at talking, but for every management consultant that talks a lot there is a larger number of consultants that actually do a lot of work. And clients talk a lot too, especially senior leaders, and ultimately every business’ goal is to make their clients happy. 

This is true for a strategy case, but other cases are pretty similar. Basically telling them what they are doing now and they should stop, and what they’re not doing now and should start doing.

Technical folks have a hard time understanding this because there is no clear deliverable, and unless they implement our recommendations the company will not be better off after we leave then they were when we came in. Strategic changes take time. 

For contrast, let’s say you’re an IT consultant doing SAP implementation. Yeah it feels great to finish the work with something to show, but after you’re done you don’t know if the client is going to use the right way, or if spending millions to get SAP was even the right thing to do. All you know is that the system is there and it’s working. Management consultants are there to answer the more conceptual questions.

> For a typical 3 week DD, first week will feel overwhelming, scheduling expert calls and structuring the market model, meeting target management and information overload on all fronts. You need to survive the first interim delivery, having something to show progress and first view on key topics. Second week key interviews start to get in place,market model becomes populated, you feel more in control. Third week some open topics still make you a bit stressed and you can’t find objective data driven answers. In the end you use what’s provided in the seller material / VDD and client will stop asking questions when they realize the topic simply can’t be solved more rigorously. Knowing that this is the rollercoaster of emotions you will go through make them easier to manage. 

In the end it’s about how high pressure the client puts on you and as u/signal-cartoonist-27 says they theoretically can put really high pressure, but most are reasonable people and realize when they can’t get anything more out of you.

> I can totally relate to what you're going through. I believe I’ve felt something similar to what you're described early on in my career.

I worked for a couple of big consulting shops before co-founding my own firm some years back. I’ve built and managed teams, and interviewed hundreds of people about the practice of consulting. Here’s some insights I’ve learned relating to your story. Take them with a pinch of salt, I’m just a random internet person.

1- Eat what’s on your plate; and dessert will follow. Stop distracting yourself by comparing yourself to your peers. Focus on the task at hand and do good work. The better you are at your job, the more levity you have to be you. If you're bored, ask for more challenging work. 
However, if you're half-arsing your current workload the senior team don't see an under utilised genius, the see a problem. Eat what's on your plate, and that will provide you with opportunities to progress.

2- If you're not getting useful feedback it's either because your manager doesn’t want to provide it (e.g., avoiding potential conflict, to busy, don't care) or they don't have the capability (they're poor at giving feedback). 
Regardless of the cause, the outcome is the same for you. In the absence of forthcoming or component managers, you need to find a way to make it easy for them. 

I find adapting Daniel Pink's "two irrational questions" quite helpful. E.g., "Dear manager, how might you rate my work on XYZ on a scale of 1-10?" If the manager gives less than 10 ask why it wasn't lower (proxy for positive feedback), and what would need to change to get it closer to 10 (proxy for improvement areas). Framing the conversion in this way serves to both force a perspective from your manager and give them a simple framework to give useful feedback to you. 

3- A great consultant knows that communication and bringing people along for the journey is CRITICAL to the job. Not so good at building relationships? Empathising with clients/colleagues to understand what's important to them? Or, adapting your behaviour to different settings?

Then either get better at it or change careers. These interpersonal skills are essential for a successful consulting career. If these are areas where you’re struggling, you can choose to actively improve or consider whether a different career path might suit you better. Most of this stuff are learned skills, it's awkward at first but I promise it gets way easier over time. 

Last thing...

4- Comfort with handling ambiguity is a must for anyone to succeed in consulting over the long term. There are two main types of ambiguity you’ll face. The first one involves dealing with client side ambiguity. each new project brings new problems, but we're trained how to navigate this kind of uncertainty; it's part and parcel of the job.

However, there's a second and less understood form; ambiguity regarding one's own career. E.g., not having certainty what industries/companies/locations you might be chucked

> It’s such a mischaracterization. Scapegoats are honestly meaningless especially for public companies.  Do you think the Board gives out a “get out of jail free card” because McKinsey was behind a failed strategy?  They do not - the buck stops with management no matter who they might bring in to advise them. 

And a copy paste from a prior response…

 But to be honest, I strongly believe the majority of consulting work does generate value for clients. Consulting didn't become a $1T global industry by accident. Noting that you're at a boutique, and there is often a very high variability in that long tail, you might want to consider other opportunities that fit better for you.

Here's something I wrote the last time "value" in consulting (specifically MBB) was brought up:

============

Three areas come to mind where we have the most bang for our buck for our clients:

strategy

breaking new ground

organizational change

Strategy - In my opinion, the company's strategic choice - who we are - is the most important decision. When you're big enough, the risk of getting it wrong is astronomical - the cost of consultants pales in comparison. Where consultants bring value is through the an independent perspective of the holistic competitive space today, where it's going, and where the white space is. While the internal people may be talented and knowledgeable about their company, they lack the broader view that a Firm who works across an industry can bring. If I were a Chief Strategy Officer, I'd have the internal team working on a strategy and the consultants creating their own take free from insider influence. Then, bring the two together to blend the best of both worlds.

Breaking new ground - If I were running a business and looking to enter into an area I was not familiar with - whether that be industry or function - a consultancy's perspective would be valuable. They would be able to bring the latest thinking, best practices, and optimized processes that would take us much longer to develop, acquire, or hire on our own. I would not hire us if the new opportunity is a clear adjacency to the core business. To put it in real-world terms, if I were Amazon trying to improve customer engagement via mobile, hiring a consultant would not be on my short list of things to focus on. But if I were Aetna or Sysco, then it could make a lot more sense. Even more so if a company is looking to make moves into new markets or diversified acquisitions.

Organizational change - I'm not using "organizational change" in the way I usually would in this context, but what I'm trying to get at is things like transformation or operational effectiveness that represent a meaningful change for the company. Like strategy, these are typically areas where best practices are helpful and downside risk to the organization is large. The difference is that, as a client, I likely know what the high-level answer is - e.g., cut costs by x%, fix the marketing department, or merge two LOBs.

> >Ultimately, this is a relationship business.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Even if I were just doing implementations, I'd still want to stop in every now and then to show the flag, let them know we're here to help, and hear their concerns.

The rationale I've always been given is 'it's easier to justify billability'. Here's the thing too, I used to believe this exactly before COVID, then COVID demonstrated to me how completely invalid this all was. I've never had an issue billing a client for the same exact initiatives for the same amount of allotted hours whether on-site or not. Not sure if the billing structure is much different in strategy, but at least in most implementations I've done — much of it is already pre-planned, and if directors are somehow not aware of this — then that's just shockingly ignorant of them. 

My issue with this rhetoric is when you have older directors/executives who have rose-tinted glasses on and are out of touch with what actually drives value. I'm not against all travel (I think based on the projects I've done, maybe 1-2 weeks of travel per given implementation \[can take about 3-4 months\] is more than sufficient), but ultimately there are still consulting firms/arms that are still trying to push back to pre-COVID level travels, which is just moronic imho (particularly for something that isn't strategy based).

I genuinely do not see how this helps anyone. You end up burning out your consulting staff on non-value add related work (i.e. travel fatigue — a person is objectively worse cognitively traveling than not, just look up studies of sleeping in foreign environments), and many of them will oftentimes just find another role with less travel. OR, you end up just having your client blow more money on travel expenditures that didn't need to occur. Doesn't matter as much with enterprise accounts, but with lower-budget non-enterprise accounts? I think they'd definitely appreciate not spending 5-10k to fly me and X number of other consultants out just so I can point out to them a flag that needs to be flipped in the config — when the same exact outcome could have been achieved with far less effort or costs over a zoom meeting. 

Maybe this is a critique of my own product knowledge, but if a complex inquiry is asked of me (in which I don't immediately know the answer), it's a lot easier for me to find a solution faster when I can reference notes on a separate monitor instead of taking it away as an action item to be addressed later.

&#x200B;

IMHO, the people here who complain about WFH and reduced travel requirements should really take a step back and actually look at what drives the bottom line/revenue generation of their role and the associated fatigue with everything you do work-related. If something is fatiguing (very broad usage of this term mind you) but doesn't actually produce anything (especially something you can bill against), I think of it as a NVA generally.

> I have a position similar to your boss, so that's my perspective. I also don't know your consulting firm set up, but I'll answer using mine as it might be similar. Also, apologies for the use of parentheticals throughout, hopefully it adds rather than confuses. 

I think your boss is moving the goalposts here. Legal says it's fine, and I'm sure legally it is (not a lawyer). Your issue appears to be that this restriction isn't the benefit that 1099 usually has (set your own hours and renegotiate regularly), and therefore you shouldn't be encumbered by W2 style restrictions. 

I would say their expectation of vacation restrictions is fine if you're on assignment through a tasking agreement (if you're expected to perform over 90 days, dropping PTO on them mid-project can screw things up). But if you're between projects, I don't know why this restriction would even be necessary. IMO these restrictions should be listed in your tasking agreement (not your overall company agreement, or the company agreement should state these restrictions being in place while on a tasking agreement). 

You're going to have to be a bit careful here. Your boss has already brought up legal (I don't think anything will happen with that), but it's mentioned because it's a hard stop in negotiating (my hands are tied because legal reviewed it). You also want to make sure there's a good relationship with your boss, because they could absolutely concede to your negotiation, but refuse to task you on projects going forward. 

My suggestion is to agree to the terms if they refuse to change, and start shopping your services elsewhere.

2. There have been a few times when I was explaining a strategy I developed. He’s very outcomes focus and I sometimes get caught in the detail (which is good because he pulls me back up from the weeds), but he would stop me and say “what are you trying to achieve?”. I’d start to explain, and he’d interrupt me again, and repeat “what are you trying to achieve?” In a slow, long drawn out tone of voice which makes me feel like I’m not comprehending.

> Look on youtube into FreePBX which is a UI on top of Asterisk, or FusionPBX which is a UI on top of Freeswitch. Both can work really well. It requires a little bit of a mind and understanding of telephone systems of old to configure but once you are used to it it makes sense. 

For example back in the day I did implement a few Lucent/AT&T systems and Meridian. The principles are still the same. They would allow you to for example have a numberplan like:

0 - reception / operator (if necessary at all)  
1000 series you could use for teams for example if necessary  
2001 hey that is your extension :P   
2002 co-worker 1  
2003 co-worker 2  
etc...

Then have something like   
3001 A hunt or ring group for like your main external number, which rings all of the 2000 series extensions that you added to the group, but if no answer you can continue to...

4001 The mailbox for teh hunt ring group or your main public telephone number...

And then you can get fancy and have like dial a 9 for an outside line, and also have internal calls...

On top of that you'd need to get a SIP trunk, a gateway. There are many providers, mine costs me €3 and then I have a local number and a geographic national number which are like €3 each. Plus the server to host costs like €9. And you are good for quite a few people.

Then for your extensions you can just have a SIP client on your desktop, and your mobile phone. The mobile phone ones need a push service and thus often come with a small subscription fee. But like zoiper can be as little as €0.99 per month.

Good luck :)

### r/VOIP — 2025-05-26 | 1pts | `churn_general`

> You have identified two ways to do it. Either use a three way calling process, or use a Bluetooth call recorder.

The way I usually do it is I call a special number on my PBX that auto answers, requests a pin. Once the pin is entered it records the call. You then use the iPhone merge call feature to add a call in which you call the person you wish to speak to and whose conversation you wish to record and then combine them into a conference. You then take the recording from the PBX. You should note that the iPhone's conference call feature is network dependent, it must be supported by your cellular service provider. Not all service providers support it. There is also a slight downside to this method in that if the person calls you, you need to put them on hold briefly while you add the call to the conversation.

The alternative way to three way calling is to have your cell number forward to a number controlled by your PBX, who is then programmed to forward the call onto your cell phone using a DISA type arrangement. That way it stays in the loop on the call, you get the call and the recording starts immediately. If your are the person making a call, you call via your PBX so the call originates from the same number and the PBX calls out again using DISA. The person who either you are calling or called you never needs to see your cellular number. The possible downsides to this approach is that depending on your carrier and calling charge setup, this can result in you paying for a separate call and potentially having the callers number hidden if your PBX is not allowed to refer the caller identity information.

The other way is as you said, use a Bluetooth call recording device. This is where the device connects as a hands free headset. It basically records the audio and saves them to the device, either to an SD card or it's internal memory. There are two issues with this method. The first is that the call audio must be piped through this Bluetooth recorder, which also means you need to use it as the speaking/listening device. Quite often they are terrible for this with really crappy mics and audio. The second issue is again, they are often generally really crappy. I have honestly yet to find a decent device for this purpose. Every last one I have tried has been awful in some way (Poor audio, mic, doesn't record properly, bad battery life, etc) and there is absolutely no single device I would recommend to you. They aren't usually made by reputable electronics companies. There is another more recent type that works via the magsafe attachment and basically places two microphones over the input and output sections of the iPhone. In my experience they aren't great, and you'd be just as well off holding a audio recorder next to the phone on hands free.

Its bad and i am starting to wonder if the company is tanking. We will not be renewing our service with the come January due to the awful service and poor customer service skills.

> Hi! I'm looking to see if anyone knows of a solution to my dilemma. Google has not been very helpful in answering this question.

I  currently use Microsoft Teams + Direct Routing at my business. This solution is cost-effective compared to many of the options out there for a business VoIP system. It works great when the user is on a wi-fi connection but has severe problems out in the field on a cellular data connection.

I was just recently testing a scheduling/job management product where the voice solution they offer is essentially a middleman. Within the app, you select the phone number you want to call, but the VoIP system actually calls you first before connecting with the call recipient. The VoIP system creates a three-way call with the user and recipient.

The software overall doesn't quite work for us, but I'm hoping there may be an alternative that can alleviate my cellular problem. Does anyone know of other systems that handle VoIP calls this way or that have an option?

&#x200B;

TL;DR:  VoIP phone system built into field service management software first calls the user and then connects the user with the recipient over cellular. It is a three-way call with the VoIP system. Alternatives?

> There is a actually a way to do this somewhat effectively. When email spam was a huge problem, some smart people had the same idea to catch spammers (ie. large trap banks). These are called spamtraps, and the techniques that have been used to make these can be used to make phone spam traps too. I would recommend reading the following articles, which have some good information on what you should try: [article1](https://wordtothewise.com/2011/08/a-brief-guide-to-spamtraps/), [article2](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/spamtraps-creating-and-seeding/), [article3](https://serverfault.com/questions/317876/how-can-i-attract-more-spammers-hitting-my-spam-traps). Generally however, the process is relatively simple:

1) Acquire a large number of phone numbers. Like a F\*\*\* load. (100-1000, depending on your budget. More is always better.) I recommend using BulkVS. I have had no problems with them before, and their rates are quite good.

2) Terminate all of these into a PBX of some kind. I think that a basic asterisk or freeswitch setup would work well. You can configure the PBX to send these to one or multiple phones depending on how many researchers you have available. You should also enable recording, CDR storage, CNAM lookups, and verbose logging on your PBX box, as this will give you some interesting information about the callers. If you don't know how to do this, I would recommend researching this, or getting someone who can. A proper spam harvesting setup should generate way more spam calls than a single person can handle. You'll also want the additional data that comes from running your own sip server.

3) Wait for calls to start coming in. You'll see that some numbers are "busy" and some aren't. Keep track of which ones are witch. Most importantly, ANSWER EVERY CALL. If you can't, ensure that voicemail is set up and works. ANSWER EVERY MESSAGE. You may even want to set up a webhook to auto reply to spam texts. Getting spam calls is like making money. The more you have, the easier it is to get more. Spammers sell lists of valid numbers to other spammers, and their computers detect answering machines and other features usually found on live numbers. When they see that you're answering and responding to their calls, they will add you to their gold lists, and you'll be getting dozens of calls a day soon enough. On the other hand, if the computer detects the three error tones usually found with an invalid number, or hears a phone error message, it will automatically scrub you from their list.

4) Make a list of the numbers that are bone-dry (Less than one call every other day). These numbers likely aren't on any list yet, so you're going to need to give them a kick-start. Start following the seeding techniques listed on the articles above, or devise some of your own. Get these phone numbers out there on social media, on public websites, on lists generally. Use them to sign up for shady services with other companies. Use them to sign up for

> > The VoIP service provider does not need to provider any "mobile network services"

You asked why doesn't your TFO request reach from the mobile network to the VoIP network. The simple answer is that the VoIP network isn't a 3GPP-compliant mobile network so you're not going to get such out-of-band requests. 

> Whenever I receive an incoming call from TMO, the only codecs listed in the SDP offer are always PCMU. PCMA and G729 in this order - AMR is not included, even though all "modern" mobile phones use either AMR or AMR-WB, and even GSM/2G uses AMR when it isn't artificially disabled via Bearer Capabilities IE.

Your VoIP provider (or their upstream providers) likely only supports PCMU, PCMA, and G729. Even if T-Mobile's network edge offered AMR-NB, AMR-WB, or other codecs, intermediate hops can (and do) strip out unsupported codecs. 
AMR-WB is still patent encumbered so its usage outside of mobile networks is quite limited. 

> But if I reject G.729 and only connect to my VoIP provider in G.711, then I should be getting unadulterated access to the "common language" interconnect by which any one telco talks to any other telco.

You're not getting unadulterated access. You are going through at least one network handoff and likely multiple. At each handoff, the peering SBCs on each side have to be configured for what each side is willing to support and generally will drop anything else.

> **Niche Focus**

As for the real estate niche, I'm not a fan. First, it’s too broad. Are you talking about residential or commercial? Are you targeting agents, brokers, SaaS companies serving the industry, or something else?

I assume you really mean residential real estate agents. If so, here are some red flags...

* Most agents are solo operators. In other words, they pay out of their own pocket and their pockets are quite shallow.
* They are reluctant to spend money on marketing tools, especially if their brokerage already provides some, like most brokerages do.
* The majority of agents are unsuccessful and close very few deals per year, if any. 
* You will ride the ups and downs of the industry when things like demand for real estate and interest rates change. In other words, you'll have hard times ahead of you when people aren't buying real estate. This cycle is 100% out of your control. You're not recession-proof at all.

If you’re committed to this niche, I'd be very clear and intentional about who is your ideal prospect. Answer questions like...

* Residential or commercial?
* How many properties do they sell each year?
* What is their average deal size or total volume?
* How much do they need to make annually?
* Which geographic markets will you target (e.g., all of the U.S. or New York City)?

Get specific, then figure out where those people spend time and what they need. Make sure your services match their business goals.

Just a few thoughts. I hope this helps. 

Best of luck!

1. Page content: 

\- Optimize Title Tags for Higher CTR with power words + service location (power words = keywords). Would recommend handwritten title/metas for top 10/20/50 pages (and then AI)

\- Add FAQs (not really a technical SEO suggestion but it has its merits. Questions and short answers helps with 'people also ask' content and searches

. JSONLD schema + social sharing (points 1, 4, 16) + star rating - Also, read about  schema for website / organisation / thing (try to get to the closest thing that works for your directory - book / movie / business etc)  

\- eg  opening hours etc are relevant if its a directory for restaurant / shops / offices. eg, for hotels, its useless



2. Page speed: The items below are meta, and will spawn into a list. that list will be complete. 

a) Run google page speed test and get all those recommendations done.

> This was run on a digital tv streaming service and generated 9 million customer leads…. So when you say more people look at social media i am not sure what your point is. The point of advertising is lead capturing. Their cost per lead ended up being $.01 per 125 leads. 

Comparing apples to tacos doesn’t make either less of a meal. You won’t get a CPL that low on any social platform ever. The only social media ads i have seen that have generated 1/1000th of the amount of leads cost quite a bit. 

You don’t see good ads on social media because people realized home made = looks like content and gets higher watches and engagement. So running TV level commercials on Social Platforms isn’t always a strategy that performs. When was the last time you saw an advertisement on social and stopped knowing it was a commercial and watched it? If your answer is all the time you should really ask others this to see if you still believe your idea is strong enough to build a business around.

> Thank you, I actually appreciate blunt answers, especially when it comes to work & business!

All of this is super solid insight, makes things much clearer for me.

Here's where I am confused now, was also discussing something similar in another comment thread on here and that person helped quite a bit as well:

I have a very healthy chunk of experience related to filmmaking. Albeit it's a lot of pre-production & production experience but not shy from video editing. For SOME reason, I was thinking I should leave filmmaking aside just as a hobby (because it's mostly for passion purposes), and dive into Digital Marketing from scratch. But after listening to some advice, that wouldn't be smart. I should do something video related. I absolutely do not want to provide on-site/hybrid services because that would mean my physical presence (hence, locally). Relative to a layperson, I am 9/10 in video editing, but when compared to experienced short form editors, I'm probably a 4. But I can learn and speed up my workflow very quickly, as I'm already familiar with the softwares. Only thing that is holding me back is my confusion on what to do and a slow laptop (can always sell some shit).

So the two paths I see could be:  
1. I can either get a \~$110-220/m job as an associate or whatever entry position in an agency & get some marketing experience. Build a portfolio and start my own thing.

2. Or I can polish up my video editing skills and get an $800-1700/m video editing remote job, will miss out on marketing & PPC/CPC ads experience though, but maybe I can figure that out later?   
  
This is where I'm stuck, should I start by providing the video editing services, have a client or two, build their trust, increase my market reputation/referrals/testimonials - and then gradually shift to Paid Video Ad Campaigns? Having learned how to run such ads using online resources/material.

I eventually want to go down the path of Direct Response Ads and similar marketing services that have a clear measurable ROI (in the form of ROAS etc), I reckon it keeps things simple when it comes to revenue growth.

> Here's an upfront/honest answer with no intentions of being rude, just trying to help.

First, get a job at an agency to gain real-world experience and learn more about marketing. There's no course out there that will enable you to run an agency. 

Starting a marketing agency without having prior experience in digital marketing is like trying to become a football coach without knowing how to play football. It just doesn't work.

* **Get an internship locally, wouldn't be paid but might get me the confidence.** Obviously sucks to not get paid, but as a last resort, it can help you get started.
* **Try getting a job, absolutely terrible pay but might get me real experience.** This would be a good option, at least for a year so you can gain some real experience. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.
* **Do another Google Project Management Specialization (Coursera), along with my Digital Marketing one it might help me land a better role at some company.** Courses always help, so you should do as many as you  can to learn as much as you can. But in most cases, they will only be differentiators for entry-level positions. Don't expect to get a better pay because you have courses, most other job applicants will have them too.
* **Learn how to run PPC Ads myself and work as a contractor for some other agency owner.** It's extremely unlikely any agency will hire you as a contractor with no prior experience. Their goal is to spend fewer hours managing their clients by delegating to contractors, not spend more time teaching you the job.
* **I don't need to learn the technical aspects of running ads myself, as I will be delegating it to a contractor anyways, and just suck it up and try finding clients (after obv figuring out my niche, service delivery, and creating an offer).** You won't be able to hire a good contractor if you have no experience yourself. I've seen this happen over and over, and it literally never works.
* **Get a remote video editing job with a decent pay, and think about building an agency around that business (will have to sell my phone & camera to get myself a decent editing rig).** If you have proven experience in video editing, this would be the best choice. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.

> Hi guys, I’ve only watched the “How they are programming your brain” one. I’m 39F and have always been a free thinker. I have experienced much push back in school, in psychiatry, and in religion as a child and still experience negative outcomes as an outlier at my age. (Theoretically) people don’t like that I don’t feel the need to change my opinions or personality to fit in and brand me as “bad”. I get accused of all kinds of stuff I’m not doing, every time it’s some different outlandish accusation with no proof and sometimes irrefutable proof of the contrary.

Yes, I work a soulless government job for one of my sources of income which I’ve basically been quiet quit ting for years and the other I work for myself co-managing a research group studying an online chat therapy service and an AI chat therapy service we’ve developed to make therapy more cheaper and more accessible to the masses (we are blessed with a founder who funds the project without needing to make profit). I obviously have more passion for the latter project.

So the reason I’m explaining who I am and what I do and what my experiences have been are because based on just this one video, I don’t see what the push back on this guy is about. I totally have not looked at anything else from him yet, but I thought all of his info in the video seemed correct. I’m not all that good on history or some of the other subjects mentioned so it’s possible I’m wrong and it’s bullshit. But I certainly can contest that my experience as an outsider has led me to draw similar conclusions about the US education system and I really have a hard time believing that he’s wrong. 

Could anyone enlighten me please? I’m willing to head out any opposing opinions and potentially change my own. Thanks in advance of anyone answers!

> Must agree with other posts here as your experience feels more regionally specific. 

US based here and was BA through AP, then left to industry. To counter your points which were honestly difficult to discern:

1) Within 2-3 years at McK one would be leading teams; within 5 years I had started my own service line and led roughly ~20 individuals which grew to 60 over a few years in addition to my team(s) which I was directly managing. It’s quite insane for you to be spending 90% of your time managing the bottom 10% of performers; in fact there is a common adage at McK that one should spend the vast majority of time coaching and influencing the middle 60% as the top 20% need limited guidance and bottom 20% will not behaviorally shift. 

2) Disrespect was never an issue in my experience at the firm and in fact, the company I am at now has significantly more rough language and behaviors than in consulting. Even more bluntly, when arriving as a McK consultant I was treated with white gloves by many clients given the direct line of communication with the CEO. In cases when clients disrespected my ASC/BAs, which happened 3x in about 10 years, I came down harshly where the Sr. Partner spoke directly with CEO who reprimanded or removed said client. Zero clue how computer screens plays into this, maybe you were just ranting. 

3) I’m very confused about what “reaching the ceiling” means in your opinion. Seriously no clue. I maintain that my experience in consulting was an incredibly steep learning journey which did not slow as I moved up in rank; in fact, it became steeper moving from BA to AP. None of the projects I worked on (over 50 engagements in 10+ years) had answers predetermined by said client leadership. I had 2 cases where a specific client had political reasons towards pushing for a specific answer, for which the engagement was discontinued as a result, regardless of loss of fees. Engagements and engagement directors (ED) at the firm are subject to multiple stage gates of risk management through risk committees who evaluate this. 

TLDR your entire post does not align with my experience being in consulting for over a decade and in industry for half a decade.

> I understand that right now you might not have an answer for this yet, but it’s useful to consider what specifically you will provide as a data analyst.

Because you’re used to working within an org that is familiar with what you do (even if it does not feel like that from where you’re standing), it’s likely that you will need to develop and refine the way you talk about your work. This is common and normal for experts that start selling their services.

Your clients know much less about the intricacies of what you do than what you probably assume, so  it’s necessary to learn how to talk about what you do in a way that connects to them (e.g. data quality is necessary for AI use, so if they are feeling the AI FOMO, there’s a hook there).

I quite like the book The Business of Expertise, from David C Baker.

It has helped me frame this stuff.

> It's both Industry and Client/Research-specific (the latter drives the profiles that are searched by Research Assistants/Recruiters to identify Candidates).

You receive an eMail/Online Notification regarding interest in your profile (which takes some time to create, includes a typical resume that you likely have, and some summary bullets on areas, solutions and processes you might be an "Expert" (Experienced) with.

Inquiries from the Recruiters are based on information from "Clients" (generally Management Consulting Companies engaged to "Survey Competitors" within certain specific parameters to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market and competitor intelligence that they will create from online research, White Papers, conversation with colleagues on similar Projects and/or Industry Experts identified through companies like GLG.

Overall, I have done two discussion in the 1.5 months I have been a member.  The process of creating and activating the Profile for Recruiters to search on their system was the most time consuming - at perhaps an hour+ with the good fortune of a current resume to upload and some pre-existing summaries I could leverage.

Both discussions were with Consulting Firms engaged in providing an "Overview/Summary/Assessment/Strategy" for specific options/approaches to setting-up types of businesses (one a Risk Holding Entity for Insurance and one a Customer Call Center operation).  Calls were 30-minutes and 1-hour, with the first a one-one-one (with additional off-camera people in the room) discussion that was poorly structures and understood by those doing the research.  The second was better researched and understood by th individual conducting the interview and included specific questions that reflected an understanding of the business and objectives of the approach she was discussing.

The option is an easy way to spend some time and earn extra cash (automatically verified immediately after the timed discussion by GLG with a request to go online, provide your preferred payment set-up by either VISA Gift Card or Direct Deposit to Banking and paid within 1-week of the time spent on th discussion).

Minuses include (as mentioned elsewhere) often times very comprehensive questionnaires that ask VERY detailed questions that include specifics which require an answer and detail.  These are sometimes quite a bit of work and look more like a Survey/Questionnaire in-and-of themselves - and are likely designed by either the Recruiter/Researcher to gather a large amount of detail (often Competitor Solutions, Approaches or known Industry Practices that would give insights as to propensity of use among other companies, types of applications and strategy).  While they do take some considerable time to complete - I find they often do NOT result in any additional questions and are intrusive as a Pre-Screening (likely aimed at getting Freebie Info/Strategy without paying the full amount).

> Any money spent on HR is less money available to pay overhead or salary for those employees.
If it's a small main street type restaurant, deli business usually they don't have much, or don't like to spend on labor. 
Think about the conversation with a business owner. How would you sell? What would be the reply from the business owner.

In my previous life, I managed a gas station, c store, rental apartments, etc. Revenue around 5mil annually. Paying employees decent wage or hiring adequate help was always an uphill battle. I had a board that I answered regarding operations. The board, or a business owner, refused to acknowledge how spending money on training, paying above the market, and better benefits would attract the best talent from neighboring businesses. 

This will allow us to form a team of memebers who are the best in what they do. Simple correct, you see the point. I see it. Everyone on this sub will also agree with what I wrote. But the board of partners, or in your case, a business owner refused to see value in hiring enough help or employing the best talent. I could not make them see it. Or they saw it but didn't agree with the benefit it provided compared to cost.

The conversation went like this.
Me - If we pay the best dollars we will attract the best talent and employees. Our customer service will go up, less turnover, also by attracting the best employees you are leaving other businesses at a disadvantage. Their employees will be second in competition. Look around us, all fortune 500 always assemble an awesome team. It's the bedrock of a successful business. You pay me top dollars and reap the rewards. We post increasing profit year after year. You give me amazing reviews. If we raise our comp by 20 percent, you can have a team that matches my work ethic and skill. Driven to make this business a success.

Answer- How will we measure that. Paying more doesn't guarantee the best employee. People come for the lowest gas price, good cook and food. They don't come here for cashier. We are happy with our profit now. It has worked like this for years. 

I left after failing to assemble a team that I wished. Having one or two great employees and the rest who have no interest in working for you leaves all the work and responsibility on those two employees. Takes the fun and your passion out. The team doesn't share your passion or care for the success of business.

So I quit. Now, I am in public accounting. Surrounded by talented people. Amazing mentors and coaches. I tried to build this in my existing job. Replicate this model for a small business. Just like you, I envisioned the benefit of mimicking strategies of Fortune 500 for small businesses and failed to let the owners see my vision. 

I hope you succeed. My advice is that small businesses are always run with short term view in mind, scarcity mentality no matter how profitable you are. The business owner does not plan for 5 or 10 years down the road. The business owner doesn't bel

> It’s your team. It’s not every team. It’s a lot of teams. Not just a consulting thing, tho culture will be project by project dependent in consulting. Let them talk about you, let them talk about others. But keep your own policy of not talking about others in a gossipy way. There is such thing as good professional gossip, such as talking about the client and leadership and what people are talking about in meetings and what different stakeholders are saying and different ideas and initiatives floating around in different meetings. This is important to engage as is relevant to whatever level you’re at. But talking about people’s personal lives for no reason other than entertainment is unprofessional anywhere, but it happens all the time. People usually get away with it, but there is always that bad bad story where their big mouth eventually bites them in the ass and they get thrown out because no one trusts them anymore. I don’t know about your industry, but I have seen that the people who are big on personal gossip and not just the professional gossip eventually get to a place where they can’t deliver the complex work that’s being demanded. 

You can develop positive working relationships with everyone, even people who gossip. Remember, coworkers are not your friends. You’re there to build success for yourself and grow as a professional and a person. Friendships can develop at work, but it’s always second to business, because you are in a place of business.

If you want to bond with them, just listen to them. Ask them questions about themselves where appropriate. If they ask you questions answer if you’re comfortable. If you believe they are prying and it’s none of their business then prepare a tactful response to disarm them. They’ll get the picture and quit messing with you. Either they’ll respect you, or be irritated at you, for setting boundaries, but it’s out of your control.

In addition to the clients you interface with, your most important relationships to cultivate are your direct line manager(s), whoever advocates for you in yearly reviews, and the partner that is responsible for your part of the project and business service line. Don’t worry about being friends with every gossip on the team.

Reason for getting out of consultancy is many sided, I think that it's mainly because I'm just flat out fed up with management self-service, the fact that (to me) it seems that there is soo many un-educated so called leaders calling the wrong shots and blaming everyone else, so much "false flag values and ethics wavering", that my glass just overflowed and I called it quits :-D

> Classic burnout description. Some facts to consider: 

The higher in an organization you go, and companies in general, the fewer of those jobs there are and more competition for them.  Higher and higher rank, fiercer and fiercer competition.

Performance evaluations are designed to squeeze more out of each employee every review cycle and make them feel bad for any small areas of lower productivity. 

Companies are financial instruments, despite whatever technology or solutions (goods and services) they are providing. They are structured so that shareholder value is maximized and the only way the company remains at the top of its industry is to increase its value every quarter or face \*active\* devaluation by the marketplace. Even flat growth is considered untenable.  There must be upward, increasing valuation.

In order to not face devaluation, a company must somehow convince or coerce its workforce to do more. They cannot ever effectively hire at a rate commensurate with the need for quarterly expansion and still increase value. Hiring means money -> out, and there is a lag because hiring takes time. The value has to come from somewhere, and it's not by fair & equal distribution of work.

By participating in this system, you are giving approval to your company to inflict these pressures on you.  Even if you have the nicest boss and team in the world, those pressures are omnipresent in the economy and will find you eventually.

You may either participate willingly or unwillingly, but if you wish to receive the compensation that you do, you will need to participate.  Your burnout is immaterial to the company, no matter what they say to you or what programs or support they offer.

So, what to do?  Find a way.  You can job hop and experience that 6 month to a year honeymoon phase over and over.  You can become very good at enforcing your personal boundaries and become diplomatically skilled to never confront your employer about it and create any tension, but the net result is you have a life outside of work.  You can look for a company where the pressures I wrote about are not extreme and it's more comfortable.  You can grit your teeth and bear it.  You can make waves and "try to change company culture" LOL.  You can start your own consulting company or individual practice and take on those market pressures personally instead of having them imposed on you by a corporate structure.  You can change careers to something you consider more fun.  You can work work work to save money and then quit and take a long leave because you want to.

There are several options.  None of which are finding a way to operate outside of this financial system.  Not for the level of compensation you are getting.  Sure, some people get lucky and write a book or create a bit of culture that makes them rich, or win a lottery.  Probabilistically, that is not going to happen. So, you have to think in practical terms what is going to work for YOU.  I suggest you think long and h

> Hi there, I see that comment section is already full of answers. So, here’s my personal experience which i feel might add some value or insight. 


I started with a MBB straight from my undergrad school and then quit after ~20 months. 

It was a great start and learning experience was phenomenal at first but last year I was staffed in the Pre sales (non billables) due to low projects in the pipeline (that was their explanation). I was told to work there for 6 months but I could see that it was not going to end for another year. I communicated this issue to the staffing and the management but no avail despite other members getting actual projects in between. After a while it occurred to me that was not at all meaningful or impactful and would severely hamper my promotion, yet I decided to work since it had a good visibility and engagement with the leadership. 

Ultimately at the turn of the year, I decided to pull the plug and take the matter into my own hands. 

It was difficult without a job in hand, but I did and I landed a job in Analytics at one of the big financial services company. 

2 months into the job, I am blown away by the culture, diversity (no target schools, everyone welcomed by their ability) and work life balance. 
The best part is the sheer amount of learning (infinite training sessions and internal courses) and the opportunity to lead the projects. 

At first it doesn’t feel like impactful work, but when i remember the impact shown on diagnostic vs the actual implementation I feel i made the right choice of leaving that MBB. I value personal time, flexibility and career advancement more instead of exit opportunities.

> Your first level hypothesis is too specific. It should simply be "The hospital should offer the additional medical service." 

The next step is to explore the factors that may or may not support this. It doesn't matter whether the answers align to your first level hypothesis or not. What you're doing is gathering insights to draw a holistic picture to form a conclusion.

So a hypothesis approach for basic categories such as product and company might look like this:  


Product (gathering information about that product that make it appealing to offer)

1. What is the product?
2. Does it differ to our existing offerings?
3. Does it have advantages? 

If the results are positive, you can draw a conclusion that the product offering is good

Company  (gather information about the company so you can see whether the offering strategically aligns or synergises)  


1. Do we currently have the capability to deliver this offering (tech, workforce, op model
2. Is further investment required? If so, can we afford and implement in a timely manner?
3. Does it align to our strategic goals (market share, patient outcomes, profit)

Notice how they're quite open questions and your final conclusion could be something like:  


Our initial assessment indicates that the hospital should offer the additional medical service for three reasons.

1. The new offering is a complementary treatment to our existing options and doesn't replace them, allowing for bundled treatment options with higher profitability
2. The new offering will support our strategic goal of improving cancer patient care outcomes by 20%
3. No additional training is required for our current workforce and the infrastructure investment will be recovered within 6 months of full operations

The next step we recommend is to explore the customer demand and competitor landscape to further the market viability and profitability of the offering.

> I (occasionally) and others (some much more often) have retainer-based arrangements for business consulting, i.e. pay a monthly fee for essentially unlimited advice/guidance in our area.

It can work quite well and be quite lucrative, but the client's own time acts as an important limiter. By that I mean that the client needs to get on the phone with me to talk, or at least has to sit down and write a well-thought-out, well-structured question in an email, one that I might take from 10 minutes to an hour or even two to answer, but still it needs to start by them dedicating time. That means that the amount of support under the retainer is naturally limited by how busy the client is.

I think this would require more care for tech professional services, especially where you're actually implementing something rather than just advising. That's because I think many smart clients could easily think up an describe an endproduct in 10 mins that takes more than a day to implement. And then change their mind the next day.

So - sounds great. But think through what will be the natural demand limiter (or at least prioritizer) in your case.

> First of all, in the spirit of the thread - honesty - I’m not quite sure if your questions are truly questions looking for legitimate answers; an attempt to hide cynicism and passive aggression towards someone who may symbolise something you’ve developed resentment or disdain for; or, just a time waster. However, I’ll give it a naive shot, assuming the best intention in you. 

1) I don’t think it is. In fact, I found that the truly successful ones, beyond the business life itself, including other aspects of their lives, seem to be the ones who aren’t. If you only measure income success, there is a mix of personalities, perhaps pretty much reflecting a similar psychological profile as any affluent group put together. So, it’s a mix bag truly. 

2) on teammates, I find ways to understand the reasons for the complication. When I feel we are incompatible, then I work towards parting ways with that individual in a respectful but clear way where I don’t seek to interact with them unless inevitable. It happens with more frequency than most may admit. If the complication is more centred on specific views, choices or styles, then I generally seek common ground by openly discussing where we are seemingly divergent. 
On clients, it truly depends. If they are large clients of the firm, I tolerate a lot more and try to find the good in the situation. It’s certainly not easy. When those are clients that are more transactional in nature, it’s about finding what makes them tick and going along with it. Sometimes it doesn’t work and you naturally “lose” the client or simply stop winning work. It’s good for everyone. 

3) my marriage is fine. I wouldn’t blame my work for any shortcomings. I think work only hides a deeper issue. It rarely is the cause. I find that lots of people who face marriage breakdown added to pile of discontentment via work (more as a psychological excuse) than actually the root cause. I don’t discard some folks are workaholics but again, it’s probably a reflection of deeper issues or insecurities. I’ve dealt with some of those and I credit my personal Christian faith as being the cornerstone to turning around my priorities in life to what really matters. I fail often but we are a lot better than many years ago. So, all in all, I think I’ve got a good marriage. 

4) I’ve answered this questions many times here and in many ways. I wholeheartedly suggest you read my answers if you’re truly seeking deeper understanding. In a nutshell, I deeply care about my family, community and to some extent general strangers who are struggling in life. In my own ways I find opportunities to prioritise with the right amount of time and financial (as relevant) investment each of those nodes in my network. Basically, God (my faith, my wife and children, my broader family, friends, community, strangers.. 

5) that’s indeed a great question. Originally, a few weeks ago when I wrote it, I simply felt in my heart on that day that I could contribute something back to

### r/consulting — 2023-06-15 | 2pts | `blocker_trust, pricing`

> Hi,

I’ve just recently had a thought that I might be missing out on a lot of income by not working as a consultant and being employed at my company. Some background: I have a MSc in business and computer science and spent the first 3 years of my career at a Big 4 firm working within Enterprise Risk. For the last 2 years, I’ve been working at a huge global security company, and have been responsible for the implementation of a new GRC & Privacy tool called OneTrust. Despite my relative young age, I have a very senior role as I have to liase with key stakeholders across the firm to establish their processes in the new mutual GRC & Privacy system.

Anyways, as with most things, once you’ve been working in the same area/system for a while, you become very good and efficient at it. My work here is almost done as I’ve managed to launch processes for almost all of our key functions across the world to use OneTrust. During a meeting with our Customer Success Manager at OneTrust, they also invited their other customer companies in my region in Europe. Due to OneTrust having been a relatively small player in the market (ServiceNow for example is much more common) I was shocked to see just how many companies actually used their services. Almost all of the questions these employers from various companies had were things I knew the answers to from experience, and quite frankly, I had better knowledge of the system than the OneTrust representative themselves.

It struck me that, despite me earning pretty okay money (€75k anually), if I was to become a freelance OneTrust consultant, I would be able to make a lot more by helping all of these huge companies actually implement the system instead of hiring employees for the job, or paying exorbinate amounts to OneTrust for their different assistance packages (which honestly helps with very little).

Does anyone have any experience of being an independent OneTrust consultant (or similar GRC & Privacy tools)? If so, how easy/hard is it to get contact with companies and ’sell’ yourself (in the EU)? How much could you charge them? Any information would be very useful. The work that took me 2 years to accomplish at my current company, would honestly take me about 1 month now as, like I said, I know this product inside and out at this point.

> First things first, I'm very sorry you were laid off and especially in the way it appears to have been handled. Ruthless, and a kick in the teeth after the effort you've put in.
I more wanted to answer your comment about the 0.1% of jobs. That's quite bleak, but I think it's also misinformed. Full disclosure I'm not a consultant, and actually having the misfortune to be dealing with some Management Consultant sorts at my job atm, but that has nothing to do with my thoughts here.

The vast majority of jobs do contribute to the world, just generally in a small, specific kind of way. Everyone serves someone or something. Companies don't pay money for nothing (except consultants, ok just kidding). The world of work is often quite siloed, so it masks the value of the work, but it's there. And I would advise anyone to think about what your work does contribute.
Builders build homes for people to live in. A plumber might feel unfulfilled but when my toilet explodes and he fixes it then I think he's a life saver.
Grocery staff are part of a supply chain that ensures people are fed without needing to tend their own farms, barbers keep us looking sharp, garbage men stop us being flooded in our own filth. Etc you get the picture.
Ok what about office jobs? More siloed sure. But still valuable. Work in the office for an insurance company? That's a vital service which spreads risk and facilitates our modern way of life. You think a single airplane ever takes off with passangers onboard in a world without insurance? Or what about those people whose homes are rebuilt following a natural disaster? Exactly. Sure you're a cog in the wheel, but your contribution positively impacts the world.
Ok well what about the real dirty, "get money" sorts. What about Investment Bankers? Well, they are greasing the wheels of the capital markets which supports investment in all sorts of industry's which provide all sorts of value to the world.
Even you consultants, I'm sure if I thought about it hard enough I'd come up with some good. Might need 3-5 working days on that one (kidding 😂)
Unless you work for the mafia, your job is probably contributing positively to the world in some small way. We can't all be -insert iconic legend here- but we can and do add value to the world. All of us ordinary decent working folks. Don't doubt yourself, look for the value you bring, and at least recognize it's not all some pointless dog eat dog rat race

As part of a conversation about cancelling the contract, they stipulated they need Lily as they require a static IP frome them (which Im sure another provider could do also??).

If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

> Hello! My company is looking for a new VOIP solution. We have used Vonage which was too expensive for us, and our current VOIP is absolutely terrible. The issues we've had are calls dropping, calls connecting, calls hanging up when we answer the phone, and customer service tells us that it is our fault and not the services'. 

  
So, we are looking for reliable service that is slightly less expensive than Vonage. We have 19 lines and 2 toll free numbers- only 4 users use the lines regularly, and the other 15 users rarely use the line, it's just to have in case we do get called. We all use the VOIP app on our personal cellphones, so there is no need for physical phones. Required features: Call routing for the toll-free number, SMS, and voicemail. Pretty basic needs.

> If you are suggesting someone make use of a particular product, service or business, you are advertising or promoting.

The same goes for suggesting *against* a product, service or business.

If someone asks a question like "How do I do X with provider Y?", your answer should be "provider Y does not offer X."

If you say "Try provider Z instead, they can do X", you will catch a ban.

Do not talk shit about providers unless it makes sense in context. 

"Provider X is taking 16 years to port my number!"
- "Yeah, they did the same to me. Terrible customer service."

Perfect!

However,

"I want to do X with provider Y"
- "Provider Y sucks lmao"

Not helpful. Instead, try:

- "I actually did X with Y and found it very difficult. I would recommend finding a different way. Otherwise, you can expect Problem 1, Problem 2, etc"

> 17 comments so far and they’re all highly aligned. 

You put yourself at high risk of not getting paid, or not being paid appropriately, if:

1. The client isn’t ethical. E.g., they “forget” to report all or some sales, or they “miscategorize” sales so you don’t get credit)

And…

2. They have the brand power to drive sales. As an example, they may have a terrible reputation in the community that requires remediation before you’d have any success with them. 

And…

3. They do the basics to convert leads to sales. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve found that clients aren’t answering calls we sent them from hot leads. Lack of any follow-up is another common problem. Guess who they blame for their sales incompetence?

And…

4. They provide a quality service to your lead. If not, the lead/customer may not pay, they may pay less than the sales price, they may get a refund, etc.

And…

5. The client ACTUALLY gets paid.

All of the above are 100% out of your control. You accept a ton of risk for arguably little reward.

I would only advise doing something like this if you have worked with the client for some time, and are sure they don’t have any of the above common problems that the vast majority of businesses have.

Also, only do something if you are rock-solid confident in your ability to deliver. I don’t mean having blind faith that you’ll rise to the occasion. I mean you’ve done it dozens of times, you know very specifically what you’re getting into, and you know exactly what it will take of you and the client to pull it off. Think science, not emotion. 

Lastly, you must get full buy-in from the client that they will do their part. Not a token “yah sure,” - a contractual obligation do so with a penalty if they don’t fulfill their end of the agreement (you’ll have wasted your time and money if they don’t).

If I were in your position, I would opt for a combination of what u/willmanracing and u/its_akhil_mishra have recommended.

1. Lower your base recurring fees. 

2. Ask the client to increase ad spend.

3. Negotiation to get paid per lead. 

I wouldn’t get into the business of calling my clients customers to qualify them. That’s time consuming, you’ll likely have trouble reaching many of them, and it’s messy AF. In the end, it won’t matter when your client disagrees with your assessment that a prospect is qualified. 

Sell leads if anything. I’d avoid selling leads that the client says are good leads (remember, they have to do all of those five things above to make this worthwhile for you, and if they’re unethical it’ll be easy for them to wave their hand and say a lead sucks). It’s stay clear of selling revenue. 

To that last point, NEVER link your payment to their profit or profit per lead you send them. It’s almost impossible for business owners to accurately determine profit per customer, and requires substantial assumption of activity base costing that are literally none of your business. Their profit is 100% out of your control even if

> Great question with a difficult answer.

Unfortunately I've seen some clients ask for proposals/tenders like these as a negotiating tactic. They ask for all-inclusive pricing with the full knowledge that they'll cut out big parts and get the cheapest possible.

It's really hard to retroactively price, but what I would do is send over the same services "broken out" and say that your previous tender had an X% discount for the whole package.

Don't take the hit to the bottom line. I don't think it's worth it, even more so because cheap clients like this are usually terrible to work with. They will continue nickel & diming you.

The only way to solve this is by not offering a la carte in the first place (not always an option, but probably worth exploring for the future). After a few times of having bad experiences offering a la carte services, around five years ago we shifted our agency to all or nothing. We work on a flat fee retainer model: you get the whole shebang of ad management, ongoing optimization, reporting, dashboard, analytics, or you don't get anything at all.

> Yes, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) is absolutely suited for this task. Using VoIP, your virtual receptionist can receive calls from anywhere with a solid internet connection and then easily divert them to the appropriate members of your staff. This flexibility makes it ideal for remote work situations, ensuring that your small business can continue to operate smoothly regardless of your receptionist's location. Additionally, VoIP systems are generally user-friendly and easy to set up, which means you won't have to spend much time learning the ins and outs of the technology. Overall, utilizing a virtual receptionist with VoIP capabilities is a great solution for ensuring efficient communication within your small business.  [So, it's definitely worth considering for your current situation.  In fact, many businesses are now using VoIP to streamline their communication processes, especially with the rise of remote work and virtual teams.

It allows your receptionist to receive calls over the internet from her rural location and then easily divert them to the appropriate staff members, regardless of where they are. This technology is designed to make remote working seamless and efficient, making it an ideal solution for your business's needs.

This can also save your business money on long-distance call charges, making it a practical and cost-effective choice. Whether you know about VoIP or not, implementing this technology will significantly benefit your business operations. So, to answer your question, VoIP is worth considering for your remote receptionist needs.

I'm the IT guy (in my spare time; not a real job) for a (very) small medical office. They currently have four phone lines (one of which is fax) through their ISP.

Outbound calling used around 600-700 minutes over the last month (not sure about inbound). I'm located a few hours away, so I can't really provide in-person support.

  
There's so much out there to try to make sense of. Again, it's a small shop, and I'm not well-versed in phone/voip (yet). We need auto-attendant (press 1 for X, press 2 for Y), but that's about it. Maybe voicemail / call transferring (receptionist picks up, transfers the call). Current after-hours system is to send a page to one of the users. No need for AI or anything big and complicated.



I've been looking at Google Workspace/Voice, O365/Teams Phone, Grasshopper, Dialpad, that kind of stuff. My users currently have physical phones, and while simplicity is certainly welcome, I don't think headsets/headphones are any kind of dealbreaker.



We currently use MS word/excel but don't have any subscriptions (standalone licenses from a few years back), so it miiiight be worth signing up for O365 to keep desktop apps updated, too? I've been a RingCentral customer and would prefer to probably not use them again (too big and heavy for our needs). I just signed up for [voip.ms](http://voip.ms) to play around with it, but I know very little about SIP and making all that work - I think I can do it, I've just never done it before.



Any help would be really appreciated. At this very moment, I'm very loosely leaning towards O365 & Teams Phone purely for the desktop apps and maybe onedrive, but I just don't know. Maybe Google. I'm driving myself in circles. I use google voice personally and it works well for my needs (I'd get them Google Workspace accounts, wouldn't use the free stuff).



I've been hands-off with their phones, but after looking at their monthly bills, I'm definitely thinking to switch things up. If anyone has any recommendations or can point out what I might be overlooking, that'd be a big help. Thank you!!

As a third option... I do have one client that is a services agency that uses an AI receptionist service for this.  She likes it, but I don't think it would be worth the price for my business.

> Road warrior here. I’ve been doing this now for a little over 12 years and I actually really love it. I’m lucky enough that I get to choose my own destiny and control most of how and where I travel (but not always). A few things that I do to help keep it interesting - YMMV.   
  
• Early flights only where possible. No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   
  
• Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. 

• Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. 

• Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   
  
• Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    
  
• Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   
  
• Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   
  
• Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   
  
• Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  
  
• Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   
  
• One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   
  
• Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   
  
• Know when to break the routine. If you’re going to a com

**Is an AI receptionist worth it? (I will not promote)**

> Is an AI receptionist worth it? (I will not promote)

Hey everyone,

I wanted to get a reality check from this group.

Is there actually a genuine need for an AI Voice Agent in your business right now?

If you are looking for one, what is the single most important quality you are looking for? Do people value a human-sounding voice over speed, or is it something else entirely?

Would love to hear your raw thoughts on this.

1. A good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate my intake into CRM. 

2. 	Workflow automation – making documents and tasks move without manual chasing.

3.	Client follow-through – getting clients to sign, fund, or comply.

4.	Template management and formatting – preserving exact legal formatting in Word or PDFs.

> I think free consults are a great way to drive business. We’ve worked with a lot of firms on stuff like this and it’s just comes down to a simple prescreen. 

Whether it’s a form, ai chat / voice assistant, or over the phone with your receptionist assistant. Goal is to gather details and get the consultation booked. Once you have details you’re prepped and ready and know which direction to take. 

You should be able to immediately figure out if this should be referred out, if it’s just a quick chat or needs more time, etc. Don’t be afraid to set expectations and limits immediately. “Hey, this sounds interesting. I’ve got a pretty busy calendar today but could you tell me a little more about what’s going?”

-Let them explain. Give a little bit of your thoughts and let them know whether this conversation should continue with you and your fee.

Worst case: You’ve got a new contact and you spent 5-10 minutes on the phone. Never know if that little question comes back later as a bigger problem you can actually help with.

Alternatively, if you have the ability, kick that to a paralegal to dig a little deeper before it gets to you.

> That 2 AM traffic is a goldmine most law firms miss! We had a similar issue with our legal clients - they'd get form submissions overnight but couldn't respond until morning, by which time potential clients had already contacted 3 other firms.

We built our AI Receptionist to solve this exact problem for law firms. It can handle those late-night inquiries, qualify leads based on practice area criteria, and integrate directly with systems like Lawmatics or Lead Docket. The key difference from services like Ngage is that it's fully automated (no human in the loop) so the economics work even at 2 AM.

One thing we learned from law firm implementations: make sure whatever solution you choose can properly segment by practice area and urgency. For example, a potential client with a time-sensitive criminal matter needs different handling than someone looking for estate planning.

Have you considered adding a website widget that can immediately engage visitors rather than waiting for form submissions? We've seen conversion rates jump significantly when potential clients can get immediate answers to basic questions before deciding to submit contact info.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-29 | 5pts | `churn_billing, pricing`

> I'm going to first put two pieces of advice I wrote in a different thread, slightly modifie; then address some of your specific questions:

I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. 

Here is what you need to make this work.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps

> My experience with hiring virtual assistants from the Philippines has not been positive. I find that virtual assistants from Latin American countries tend to offer better quality work and a culture that aligns more closely with the West. 

Philippines: I have encountered issues with dishonesty, as some VAs from the Philippines have worked for multiple companies simultaneously despite using time-tracking software. They have tried to cheat or disable my time-tracking software. Additionally, I have observed that their educational qualifications do not reflect a basic level of analytical thinking or problem-solving skills. In my experience, Filipino VAs with "BS or MS degrees" have shown performance levels below those of a high school-educated individual from the West. Dishonesty seems to be a recurring issue with them. If the tasks require any analytical thinking, I have found it challenging to rely on them. 

I am eagerly anticipating advancements in AI to handle virtual receptionist and basic assistant tasks.

> Thanks u/Hi-ThisIsJeff . Your response style is kind enough so now I feel I can speak my mind.

I don't think I am novice. But I am too much interested in what are the problems faced by real people (here, consultants). During my own 17+ years of consulting(most of the time, ERP consulting),  I have worked with people from receptionist to senior most strategists, (govts, private sector..). But nothing felt FULFILLING. They all were representatives of SOME ORGANIZATION, most of the time. 

I am more interested in helping in them solving their most challenging problems with my wide knowledge of techs (like Deloitte solved the complex case of bribery using AI as shown in their case study). My initial plan was to help individual consultants develop that kind of wide thinking to pull out very innovative solutions. But seems that I don't have resources to educate them on it. That's why I am thinking to change my model from "course" to "solution"/  


>What is the timeframe required for you to create this new on-demand course?

Rather than course, it's "solution on-demand" service. It goes like this..

Me : Dear(consultant/director).... throw me your some of the most common problems you face and I may be able to  help you.

You (as client): I wish there could be better solution to document version control.

Me : Prepares a full solution (mainly in form of video) and offer the solution for nominal price.

If many consultants are facing this problem, this become my course. So no specific time frame promise, but a good chance of getting rid of their pains.

>What will your custom course offer that I couldn't find on the internet or YouTube today?

If they had found a solution, they wouldn't tell me in first place, I think.

> This is exactly why I usually don’t recommend Martindale-Hubbell. They charge high monthly fees, the sites look dated, and the worst part is they “own” everything — so if you ever want to leave, you’re stuck.

For a firm your size, I’d recommend building on **WordPress**. It’s user-friendly, easy to update, and if it’s set up the right way from the start, it gives you a solid foundation for growth. That way, even if you’re not super techy, you or the attorneys can still edit pages, post updates, or add bios without needing a middleman.

The key is investing in a **professional setup**. You can absolutely find someone on Fiverr for cheap, but you’ll usually end up with a clunky site that doesn’t perform. A properly built WordPress site can look clean, run fast, and last you years — while also being built to support SEO, PPC, and even Local Service Ads if you decide to run those later.

I specialize in working with firms in similar spots and the biggest difference is building the site not just to “look decent,” but to actually **support lead generation**. Even if most of your business is referral-based, having a site that shows up when someone Googles your firm name or “criminal defense near \[city\]” or "attorney \[attorney+name\]" makes a huge difference.

So my advice: skip Martindale, set up on WordPress, get it built right once, and then you’ll have something that’s professional, easy to manage, and not tied to a crazy monthly fee.

> You can probably still amend or file a notice of errata. Point it out to your boss is painful. But saying, “I caught this mistake, here are potential solutions” is miles better than staying silent and letting it become an unfixable problem. Everyone makes mistakes now and again. Even lawyers. Catching it shows humility and responsibility. Your boss might be a little upset, but it’s not the worst thing in the world. 

Also depending on your state the fact that they weren’t served properly won’t matter too. You filed an answer, so you obviously have notice of the case. The remedy for improper service is usually for the court to order service. And if you’re standing there in court the judge can turn to you and say, will you accept service.

> So I’m currently in the process of trying to be that guy. I’m definitely not there yet, but I have a fledgling solo criminal defense practice that is attracting clients with difficult charges who are willing to pay more than the average rate in my area. I certainly don’t have all the answers, and I have a long way to go, but I’ve been building towards what you are talking about.

  
No one cares where you went to law school. I went to what many consider the worst law school in the country. I have been asked where I went to law school by a client 1 time in 7 years of practice. And he was actually a business law client.

  
Work somewhere out of law school where you can work with excellent attorneys and do a shit ton of cases and take them to trial when it’s appropriate. Look to those excellent attorneys for mentorship. Today I’m working on voir dire questions for a case that two mentors of mine are trying next week. I’m not getting paid, I’m just doing it for the love of the game. They asked me for help because I kicked 8 jurors for cause in a felony DUI trial last week leading to me winning a case I had no right to (technically, one charge hung 9NG-3G). The way I did that was by using a method I learned from another exceptionally talented attorney I go to for advice.

  
I’ll help other attorneys with trials for free. Sometimes I’ll just spectate on trials. 

  
Have excellent customer service. I loved House MD as a kid, but in real life House wouldn’t be a great doctor despite his technical brilliance. Bedside manner is fucking huge in any service industry. There are occasions where my client gets the same result they would have gotten with a PD or even pro se. A lot of what clients pay you for is for peace of mind. They want to know they are getting the best possible outcome. Never underestimate the value of just being emotional support.

  
Make sure people hear about that customer service. I worked for my last firm for 13 months. In that time, I got well over 100 google reviews for his firm that mentioned me. Now when a person is looking at his site, they hear about how highly people think of me. Can’t say any of them have been famous, but I have gotten a few calls in the last two months (how long I’ve been solo) to the effect of “I’ve got \_\_\_\_\_ charges and I hear you’re the guy/the best/awesome”. Usually they read that on a review somewhere, or a friend told them. I’ve gotten a Google review was from a juror who was impressed by me. I handed out 5 business cards to the jurors in my last trial last week.



I will talk to strangers in the courthouse about their case. It is obvious to everyone who meets me that I have a deep passion and love for what I do. Given a choice between being first chair on the next OJ trial and a billion dollars, my friend and colleagues all know what I‘d pick.

> Part 1

Hi r/legaltech! I'm Alex, the Social Media & Community Manager at iManage. Thank you for raising the questions. I've taken the thread back to the iManage Product Team, and we have prepared the response below.

\-

Thanks for the discussion here. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback, and we'd like to address some important misconceptions directly.  
  
**RE: Semantic search vs. keyword search**  
Several commenters raised a core tension: lawyers want *exact* matches, not fuzzy semantic approximations. As someone mentioned: "If I'm searching iManage for a document or specific phrase, that's what I want - exactly."

  
**We hear you, and we agree**  
Ask iManage is not replacing keyword search or forcing semantic matching on users who don't want it. Traditional search isn't going anywhere. We've built a different tool to solve a different problem: answering questions that might span multiple documents when you *don't* already know exactly what you're looking for.

  
When you know the document name or a precise phrase - use search. When you need to synthesize information across matters, find patterns in past work, or answer questions like, "What termination provisions have we used in vendor agreements?" - that's what Ask iManage is for.

  
To clarify how it works: **it's agentic retrieval over the Work API, not full RAG with embeddings over your entire DMS.** The system iterates through multiple search strategies using Work's existing filters, security, and ranking to narrow down to a high-confidence set of documents. Any semantic analysis happens *post-retrieval* on that smaller candidate set, not by maintaining vector embeddings for millions of documents. This approach ensures the DMS security model stays intact.  
  
**RE: Timing and pace of innovation**  
One commenter asked why this wasn't introduced "\~2 years ago when RAG was all the craze." Transparently, it's because we wanted to get it right for professional services environments, and not ship something that could frustrate more than help. RAG over a challenging, permission-controlled document repository with millions of emails is a genuinely hard problem - as several of you noted. Garbage in, garbage out.

  
We spent that time solving for:

* **Security-first retrieval** that respects your existing permissions
* **Iterative search strategies** that use structured metadata, not just embeddings
* **Answer quality** with citations users can verify, not confident-sounding hallucinations
* **Agentic architecture** that reasons about what to search for, not just what matches a query

Shipping early would have validated every skeptic's worst fears about AI in legal. We wanted Ask iManage to be useful in more ways.

### r/agency — 2024-09-22 | 2pts | `churn_general, pricing`

> Super exciting! Congrats on the opportunity. You're going to crush it.

One very helpful mantra I have learned ([from DHH of Basecamp](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71)) I tell myself all the time is: **when you plan a project, you are doing so with the absolute worst understanding of the problem.**

When I first started my agency (one year ago, still very new to the game), I was completely paralyzed when it came to writing my first proposals. I told myself: *"how am I supposed to confidently present a plan for something...when I've never done that thing? They'll know I'm full of shit...or I'll estimate everything all wrong and will look like a fool."* So my advice is keep your proposal as simple as possible, focus on the things you do know to be true versus what is variable, and know that projects will always evolve over their course. Priorities shift, clients want changes, what you launch doesn't work perfectly, etc. This is fundamental to the process of making anything, and going in with a positive and adaptable mindset is the most helpful frame.

* **In terms of time,** that's an easy place to start - how much can you realistically devote \*without\* impacting other parts of your life that are important to you? **Only you and you alone can set your boundaries.** So if the answer is 2 hours every other day (so Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), then the answer is 6 hours per week. If you don't draw a clear line in the sand, the people you're working with won't know what is reasonable for you - so they'll ask for more. And not because they're inherently demanding, just because they don't know your boundaries. And without boundaries, you'll come to resent the work - and that's a bad place to be. So ask yourself what *you* *want*.
* **What you do vs delegate**: again, this is all about your boundaries. It seems like it's important for you \*not\* to run socials yourself, so make that clear to your business partner. Offer to work together to find someone who can dot hat work that works within the project's budget. Or, if you want to take ownership of hiring and managing that person, that's your choice - just make sure the price you charge incorporates that cost.
* **Your hourly rate** is hard to help out with without more information. It depends on your location, your years of experience, the project's budget, what similar consultants in your area/market charge for similar services, and more.
   * But since this is your first project, I wouldn't get too hung up on price - you can always charge more for the next project. I would consider the floor price the minimum amount that is worth your time. Said another way, it can't be *so low* that when you're mid-way through the project, you're upset that you didn't charge enough. That's another easy path towards resentment and feeling taken advantage of.
   * Another way to think about it is: if you put a price that's too high in your proposal, your bus

### r/agency — 2024-07-15 | 3pts | `churn_general, blocker_trust, pricing`

> A few options...  
  
1. **Do nothing**. 

Don't accept the deal and see where it goes. Maybe they'll forget about it...maybe not. Not a great option. It's best to transparently discuss these kinds of things with your clients.

2. **Take the deal**. 

If you take the deal then there are many side effects to consider.   
a) What's the opportunity cost? Not just financially from other deals that will no longer materialize, but also in the risk of working for just one client.   
b) Can you guarantee they will pay you?   
c) Can you guarantee that they'll continue to use your services?  For how long and at what levels?  
d) Can you gain exclusivity with them too? In other words, if you can't work for anyone else, will they commit to not hiring anyone else for their YT/socials? This is a real threat because it's 100% possible and even likely that they could dilute what they give you over time.    
e) Can you get a higher rate or more services (e.g., not just YT, but what about other platforms too like IG) that with your existing arrangement?  
f) What are the contract terms? How long are they locking in for? I'd make it at least two years.

3) **Reject the deal**. 

The big con with their proposal is that they'll be taking 100% of your agency's resources, bandwidth, and future opportunities. If you take a deal, you're effectively not an agency anymore...you're a contract vehicle to provide individual talent to a single client...a staff augmentation contractor. You wouldn't have much of a future, if any, as an agency. There's nothing wrong with that and you can can probably make some dough with the arrangement, but it's a completely different business model. If you're considering rejecting the deal, first review possible alternatives that could make the arrangement more to your liking and reduce the client concentration risk. Push hard to make it the right deal for you, because worst case, the deal and relationship fall apart and you're back to being an agency. What's really the worst case to rejecting the deal? You go get more work elsewhere, and there's plenty of that to go around. 

4) **Proposal an alternative arrangement**. 

Counteroffers could be:  
a) Tweaking any proposed terms or items listed in the rest of this answer.  
b) Insist on the ability to take on other work. It'd be in your best interest to have as few restrictions as possible.   
c) Make sure you get paid and handsomely.    
d) They buy you out. They'll going to be taking 100% of your agency bandwidth, and why not just acquire you? 

I hope this helps you think through your options.

> So, I just started my agency 4 weeks ago. A lot of this won't apply to me, but I'll raise objections to these anyway.   


>If they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Look at the worst ones and see how the agency responds. If they did not respond, ask them to explain what happened.  
IF they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Be suspicious

I don't have any reviews. Doesn't mean I'm bad. I've worked in Meta and several other big tech brands as well as running ads for my own startup.

Not having reviews or not means very little. Most business owners/marketing teams are too busy to leave reviews. Then you have agencies like KlientBoost, who I know for a fact, who pays for reviews.   


>Look at how they do their own advertised services for themselves. If they are a web developer, how is their website? If they run ads, find their ads on Facebook Ad Library or Google Searches by searching the agency names. Do they come up? What's the quality like?

I don't know if ads are any good just by looking at them, so I'm not sure how you would gain any insight from that. We don't know how they're doing their retargeting, how those ads are delivered, which part of the funnel they're being delivered to, etc... 

We can make assumptions based on copy and design with what little information we have, but I would say making assumptions isn't very effective in the majority of situations--especially with little context. 

In fact, it's well-known that B2B champions and decision makers start the procurement process through social by speaking to their peers--dark social. So depending on the target deal size and service complexity, it might be beneficial to not run ads at all and instead focus on content.   


>Look at their previous work and case studies on their website. Do they have them? Check out the companies they mentioned. Look at how that company is doing the services the agency claims to provide. Is it well done?

Case studies are low-hanging fruit with dramatic results. They aren't peer-reviewed. Not an effective way to demonstrate expertise nor judge it. There is an exception here--progress over time. It's also best if they can provide rationale. Multiple wins over an extended period of time which shows that they deliver beyond low-hanging fruits and can do more than push buttons.   


>Look to see if the agency is organized and follows structured methods. Ask to see their SOPs, also known as standard operations procedures, to see if they have one. Do they have a clear system for getting started and taking you through the processes? How do they manage their client relationship? How do they know that they are failing you?

I don't have anything to argue here. This is clearly necessary. But how really just how detailed are those SOPs? Also is there an emphasis on strategic thinking? Because I worked at a large international agency, and that's what people lacked most.

> But tea leaves aside, what you really want to do here (like any good consultant :) is to ask lots of questions. Like so: "So, I'm very excited about this opportunity! But since I've never worked in consultancy, I'm just trying to build up a picture of how you all work here.

**Client**: who's the commissioning client (level / role)? who do you liaise with day-to-day? what's their budget? what typically leads them to work with you in the first place? 

**Competition**: who do you compete against for these contracts? Who are the hardest competitors to beat? Why?

**Case**: what's the typical scope? What's the largest / smallest project you ever worked on? What are 'deliverables'? Who approves them? How much do you usually iterate? Describe the 'ideal' project for your firm - what made it ideal? Now describe the 'not great' version - what made it suck?

**Core competencies**: what makes your firm suited to the type of work it does? how would clients describe it?

**Collaboration**: how do you work with the client? what is the best possible setup? what's a bad setup? (how close is the 'usual' to best / worst?)

**Case team**: who's on the team? What are their levels and backgrounds? Where do you like to hire from (firms, universities, backgrounds)? Are they dedicated to one project / multiple projects? -- What's a 'typical day' like when you're on a project? What's a typical day like when you're 'on the beach' (not staffed on a project)?

**Commercials**: How do you win new business? How do pitches work (custom? standardised-ish?) Who wins new contracts? And how will you be involved? --  How do make money (billable hours? deliverables? all-inproject fee?). How do you price your services? Are clients price-sensitive? 

Now ideally don't turn this into an interrogation, but make sure you get good answers in the course of a conversation. Read between the lines, and try to build up a picture of a typical day, and that of a bad day.

(Top tip: joining as a manager / director? ask to have a chat with one of the more junior team members, and get answers to the same questions. Read between the lines ofc, but you should get a really solid read)

When she quit, we had to alternate paralegals to answer the phones. I often had to get the door. They never hired a new receptionist, and it was the #1 complaint of everyone working there. You will get more tasks as you are there longer but I can promise you those basic tasks really do free up the staff to do the work clients psy for.

Dear Accountant, 

As I've explained several times, lawyers just like accountants have ethical obligations with respect to clients and service. Lawyers are unable in any way to provide referral fees to non-lawyers. Period. The rule is [linked here.](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer/) The answer would have been the same if you brought this up two years ago. 

I'm disappointed that I have to keep reiterating that your proposal is flatly unethical and against my professional conduct guidelines. I can be disbarred and lose my entire livelihood, regardless how you proposed to structure the transaction. Structuring a financial transaction to obscure its purpose is also a problem for accounting professionals, as no doubt you are aware.

Best of luck to you in your business.

> Oh!  $10?  Maybe that makes a difference.  I was thinking of what I've read / had to do with the free level of service.

Not to quibble, but you said = google voice told me...    in a chat / call?  Or a web page?  In general I am disappointed in most EVERY business and it's a running joke with my wife - ask a question and get an answer.  Ask someone else at the company and get a different answer.  and rarely, if you ask a 3rd person there, that you get a same answer as a tie breaker.

and you mention google voice isn't offering a permanent number.... not sure of the interface, but you don't want a number they offer you.  You want to port in your number and THAT will be a permanent number.

Down a rabbit hole..... I googled $10 google voice and got told it's called starter:

**A Google Voice $10 price point refers to the Google Voice Starter plan for businesses, which costs $10 per user, per month, but requires a separate** [**Google Workspace**](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1111US1111&cs=0&sca_esv=8e23599b05dcda53&sxsrf=AE3TifP68a2Edmh1KvZGLTSShAIkIk7abw%3A1756135883196&q=Google+Workspace&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5mr_7o6aPAxVkGVkFHQyVCZsQxccNegQIAhAC&mstk=AUtExfDznIP8V4VA6cTlBrF_B8bIQ0MHsf-bfqCdsPnXZUz5jnGlmwSZyZJSFJGekL0ot-2Sh6XENXEP4N3KKYey74Tgzk0HGidG6KgEJAXZhh2shPJKznQRK3h8YBy8W_dSwmwvnnYEgTjAmJWh5iju4Xc8YuAfYzVUMKddkQ8qHBQsN38Di82460ixmaDKJRdKAk-olwTZtfEXjNpOb-FFz4NEBcDKDisSP7q26HrPxgTk46Yhj-mmBNYbDkjJ6nbrVBlBJ3K41SWSC-adF6wm3yQkkQTpWfN6HdVMppzIGuUlRw&csui=3) **subscription, starting at $6-$7 per month, to be used.** 

Googling google voice starter plan port in, I get:

**You cannot port a number into the Starter plan for Google Voice. Number porting is only available for Google Voice for Business plans, which require a Google Workspace account, not the individual, free, or paid plans of personal Google Voice. You will need to set up a business account to port a number into Google Voice.** 

So that's wrong at least on this:....  number porting IS available on the personal / individual plans.

And starter?  There's a personal version (you are on?) and business?

That's googling / AI answers about a GOOGLE service.  

I get soooo frustrated at the inability to get accurate answers from companies.   perfect example here - you will likely get more accurate info from someone (seems like it won't be from me... sorry!) here rather than google's own pages.

> THE ISSUES: 

We get no coordination between phones, one phone will ring and the other won't acknowledge a call ever happened. Our call histories are completely different, even after waiting a day and signing out and in we can never get anything to match. Better yet, you can't even seem to delete a simple text message from the application when you want to, instead receiving an error message that it's unable to be deleted. 

The voicemail is a huge disappointment. There's no voicemail box that can be accessed from both phones via the app. Instead one user gets the voicemail and the other gets an email with the voicemail attached. I could live with that except the voicemail is attached in .wav format which is not supported by any extension in existence on google chrome so every voicemail needs to be downloaded to just listen to it. 

Text messaging (we have our 10 DLC registration) seems to decide on whether it will work or not day by day. Sometimes messages send, sometimes they don't, but they always show they sent on my end just adding to the confusion and irritation. I end up often having to give customers my personal number so that we can effectively communicate. The entire reason I have a VoIP is to just use one number and now we have customers that have three numbers, exactly what I wanted to absolutely avoid! 

Don't even get me started on the Bluetooth connectivity with vehicles, it's bizarre. If I had been on a call at and get into my vehicle at a later time, long after the call has ended my vehicle Bluetooth thinks there is a phone call in process. But there is no phone call and the only way to get my phone to connect correctly is to completely restart my phone, closing the Nextiva app doesn't have an affect at all.

Worst yet is the scenario when I try to answer a call while connected to Bluetooth. When I pick up, the music lowers volume but does not stop or turn off completely. It continues to play via the car speakers but sounds as if it is playing through the phone speakers (poor audio quality) at the same time the callers voice comes through the speakers as the music continues to play but at a very low volume (even when volume is all the way up). I have no idea if the caller can hear the music on their side but its impossible for me to hear them anyways so I have to be sure to turn off Bluetooth before taking a Nextiva call. When taking a phone call on my actual phone, none of these issues exist. 

This has happened on both my Galaxy S20 Ultra and my new Galaxy S22 Ultra (just upgraded a couple weeks ago) so it's not a phone issue. Making things EVEN worst is the fact that I have "Number Garage" another VoIP service on my phone for another business that I do not own but manage. That VoIP and application that costs a FRACTION of what Nextiva costs seems to work flawlessly with little to no issues in comparison. 

Now I am unsure on what direction to go in, I've been researching other VoIPs but hesitant to make any decision because I a

> First of all - good for you have decided you want to get involved into business / making your own money.  Being freelance myself for 6+ years, 2 of them running my own agency I can give you these tips from the bottom of my heart:

1 - don't chase status, which you are by asking a the question "what" agency you should start. I'm not accusing you, but it comes off as you wanting to get "the answer" of what service to start. Now image your car breaks down and you call a mechanic. But this mechanic is doing this only for two weeks and don't get your car running, just because someone told him being a mechanic is "the best way to be self-employed". 

Now, the point I'm trying to make here is that running an agency sounds cool, but is it? Rather than focusing on the status, focus on yourself and your skills. Nowadays you can make money with everything, literally. What skills do you have or have the interest to learn? What "problem" do you want to solve or what kinda people do you want to have an impact on? Don't wanna work with people? Maybe a service based model isn't for you, maybe it is, only you could know. 

Go step by step, it's like a game. Don't ask what Porsche you should buy if you haven't earned your first $1 yet. Don't ask about the agency, ask about your skills, your interests and what you could do all day without even getting paid. 

2 - plan maximum only 12 weeks, not 10 years. You have no clue what's waiting for you on the other side. It always never plays out the way your think / plan and that's okay, it's called live. Ride the wave, enjoy every minute of it and focus on your craft. 

3 - talk to a lot of people. Be interested in different business models, entrepreneurs, "agency owners" (not Iman Ghadzi videos) and ask about their service, experiences and upcoming. The phase you're in is the very very first step, act like it. You don't need to make 100k, you don't need automations or fancy systems / software / coaching. Stay away from shiny objects and try being okay with you having no clue what you're doing. Don't put a time on it, it's about the lifestyle with all the goods (status, money, accomplishments) and the bad (confusion, clueless, loneliness, disappointment etc.) 

You're gonna find your thing, wish you all the best :-)

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

> "If you're not making the firm money then why would they continue to employ you."

For the same reason that the firm employs folks like the receptionist, the Intake Specialist, the Office Services Clerks, the Records Manager, the IT Manager, and the Biller.

None of those folks can bill their time to clients for what they do.  But, what they do SAVES the firm more money than it costs to pay them.

Firing a paralegal - especially a paralegal who has expertise in an Admin function like Billing, or IT, or Records management, or Risk Management - is wasteful, and could expose the firm to wrongful termination claims in the future.

The much more cost-efficient strategy is to re-train or cross-train paralegals who are failing to meet billable requirements into doing some of the cost-saving functions that the firm needs just as much as time-billers as profit centers.

Using what you have - instead of wasting money to recruit, hire, train and retain new talent - is one of the principles of Strategic Management.  Since you didn't mention it, that indicates that you went straight to law school from undergrad.

I personally find that Clio just adds an extra layer of hassle because it doesn't integrate well with outlook, doesn't integrate at all with mobile (seriously, I can't email a PDF on mobile?? In 2024???), and I have to constantly reinstall it when I switch from desktop to laptop.

So, after a few weeks of fighting with it I just save everything to dropbox first and then drag it over to clio. If I need to email someone a PDF from my phone, dropbox makes it possible. Whatever. It's their money and I'm a team player.

As for a receptionist, I don't see the need. The clients and realtors get my cell. On the extremely rare occasions that a client abuses this privilege, caller ID saves the day and I just decline the calls, close the deal, and never work with that client again.

If those systems help you make more money than they cost you, though, more power to you. Always interesting to see how different systems work in different set ups.

> I worked for a solo six months after he hung his shingle in 1997 until 2022.  Hire the most experienced paralegal you can afford.  I slowly took over many of the routine office management responsibilities to give him more time for rainmakering.  Don't be afraid to hand off responsibilities that slow you down, and include this person in meetings for things like insurance needs, office supply needs, light bookkeeper needs, and other ordinary "office running" necessities.  If you should get sick, which happened in my case, I needed to know where things were and who to call.  Same with setting up an agreement with another attorney who can sign routine pleadings in an emergency.   In our case, my bosses illness was severe enough where a Notice of Unavailability needed to be filed in some cases to extend litigation deadlines.  These are the kinds of things you never think will happen, but do.

We had a receptionist full time and experimented with using just a phone service to take messages.  For us, that bombed. Yes, it was significantly cheaper, but our clients liked (and were willing to pay for) handholding.  Our receptionist was a gem, and I credit her caring nature in the office for client retention.

Remember, this is old school advice.  I happen to have my own personal personal injury case going with another firm that does everything remotely.  Right now, because my case has been reassigned (yet again), I wouldn't be able to recognize my own attorney or any staff if I walked into a courtroom.  It is certainly not a full service firm as I have been responsible for delivering documents any paralegal could easily obtain to move my case forward.  We were a full service firm.  I believe there are plenty of clients still willing to pay for full service.

Advertising is so different now. I can't offer any helpful information.  It's all so different now.

If I can help, let me know.  There were decisions that were great, and others that bombed and wasted so much money.

### r/LawFirm — 2026-01-04 | 7pts | `churn_general`

> Paralegal here. Also former tech analyst, been following tech and AI for 25+ years.

Here's the fundamental problem with "AI" as we know it today. In the efforts to build a system that is "predictive/generative" (e.g. capable of guessing or "creating"), tech has somewhat intentionally moved to a model where probability is more important than accuracy. 

Let's look at something as basic as spell checking. It used to be that you'd choose a "dictionary" for spell checking in word processors like Microsoft Word. This meant that if you were (for example) in the legal profession, you could install a legal dictionary that had specific phrases (e.g. Latin) and spellings that conformed to your specific needs. If you were in a doctor's office, you could put in a medical dictionary instead. This reduced both spelling errors and the "false positives" you get when spelling something correctly according to YOU but not what the "spell checker" thought was incorrect.

That went away.

Then instead of flagging the error, we had "auto-correct" everywhere. So now, the computer simply assumes that when I type something, that it knows **better** than me, so it changes it. My favorite current example of this is how on the Mac, when you type b) (as in... a) b) c) it will auto-correct it to the sunglasses smiley emoji. It will do this even when I click the little X to say "don't do that", meaning I have to CMD-Z then right arrow to get away from the highlight, all to get... exactly what I typed.

Now, we have "predictive text" where increasingly, products assume they can predict what I want to say. Usually, it's not too bad, but occasionally, it results in errors in *meaning* that I have to correct. Not at all what I want.

So let's look at the particular problem of redacting medical records. Keep in mind that AI is designed to **approximate** thoroughness not actually achieve it. What's weird is that if you took a "non-AI" approach to redacting (for example) SSNs, it should be pretty easy:

>Flag any string of nine digits, including if they are separated by dashes or spaces. If the string starts with a 9, 000, or 666, flag it separately.

That is an "old school" (computing-wise) way of stringing absolute yes/no queries together to form a near foolproof search. 

**But that's not how tech is doing searches anymore.**

So, when I open a PDF in Acrobat, I'm literally bombarded with efforts to get me to use "AI" when all I want to do is easily search for and redact information, then properly Bates number and produce. 

To be honest, it's not the process of manually redacting that is "killing" me as a paralegal; it is the constant and unwanted changes to functionality and interface that big tech companies (looking mostly at you Adobe and Microsoft, but Apple and Google suck nearly as much) insist on making to critical software. 

I'm sure I'll be criticized as "biased" since as a "paralegal," my job is "threatened by AI," but... I'm not worried at all. My SAs trust me to pr

> Depends on what area and how you’re getting new clients now. 

Shrug - It’s true most people won’t hire you from social media. But most won’t hire you from a website either. But they will get to know you and your firm. They’ll get to watch video, see how you interact with others - see if they fit in with your culture and eventually they’ll hire you. The more exposure they have to you, the more likely that conversion will happen and happen sooner. 

It used to be people had to have 7-10 touches with a business before buying since we’re all bombarded with ads all day everyday it takes 23-25 now. Having consistent social media posting is one way to do that. 

If you’re running ads on social media consistent posting will help with better targeting thus reducing your ad costs as it reaches the right people more consistently. Since some law firms are now getting business through being recommended by AI (aka geo) regular posting on social media is one of the “trust signals” AI uses those to prioritize who it recommends. 

When someone looks at a law firm to hire now they don’t just go to Google (or the yellow pages as they did before Google) most will ask friends and family, go to Google and then stalk their socials and website to see “is this someone I connect with.” 

Honestly the #1 factor I’ve seen is how fast you answer the phone and get them in the door when they’re ready to hire. But again it depends more on your firm’s specialties- family law, criminal, immigration, PI - when they need an attorney NOW they’ll grab who gets them in first. Contact disputes they’ll dig through everything about them. Wills, estates, trademark most are referral businesses. 

I’d never say give them up totally but wouldn’t make it a top part of your marketing budget if you’re struggling  - plus as someone else mentioned you need to save your name or someone else will snag it up and then when you do want it charge you to get it back.

There are a lot of charlatans in the SEO space it's taking us years to find a reputable company, and even they aren't perfect.

Unless you have an unlimited trust fund, you'll never be able to compete with the big marketers in your area. There are probably multiple firms with eight figure marketing budgets.  You have to figure out where they've left gaps in their coverage and paint those corners.  Make sure your personal network knows what you do.   Your style is your style, but there are ways to remind your Facebook friends what you do (posting about a hearing or interesting details about a specific case, check in at your state bureau of investigation when you take a medical examiners's deposition) without coming across as an ambulance chaser.   

Figure out how AI can help you .  I'm no expert, but it's amazing how much time the upgraded ChatGPT account has saved me.   By no means is it perfect and be careful for legal research, but proofreading briefs and stylistic improvements can be amazing.  Upload your motion and the defendants responses, provide other helpful details like depositions, and let GPT brainstorm creative arguments or pour out inconsistencies in the defendants briefing, etc. Just make sure to check everything before you cite.  Spend time creating good prompts and you can easily summarize depositions or create timelines etc.

Try to share Office space with other personal injury firms if possible. It's amazing how many successful strategies we've developed were ideas of other attorneys shared during an encounter in the hallway 

If you don't already, get an assistant or paralegal ASAP. Both for optics (who wants a lawyer who answers their own phone) and because your time is much more valuable generating business or closing out your cases than licking stamps and sending letters .  

Finally, get a good bookkeeper ASAP. Don't waste your time doing quick book entries unless you have significant bookkeeping/accounting experience. Trust accounts are no joke and you can get in big Doodoo if you mess that up, even innocently.

Enjoy!   I started with no cases and an $800 HP computer attached to a dropbox account – now we have a 20 person Firm and handle 7 to 9 figure cases.   I say that not to brag but as context for this statement: the most enjoyable years in my career were the first 3 to 5 of the firm when we were building the Firm and trying to figure it out.   Of all the recoveries over the years, the most memorable was that first million dollar settlement, which felt like proof of concept for us.    It's a ton of fun!

> If you're a law firm looking to improve your visibility in Google search results—especially local searches—don’t overlook the power of legal directories. Some may be skeptical about their direct lead generation value; however, the *SEO benefits alone can justify the listing*. Here's why:

# ✅ 1. AI & Structured Data Readability

Many legal directories are being scraped by AI and voice search tools like Google's SGE and ChatGPT. Being listed makes your firm more **eligible for inclusion in AI-generated answers** by increasing your digital footprint across trusted platforms.

# ✅ 2. Earn High-Authority Backlinks

Most directories include a dofollow or nofollow link to your website. These **backlinks from trusted, niche-relevant domains** send strong authority signals to search engines. Even nofollow links help diversify your link profile and show relevance within the legal industry.

# ✅ 3. Improve Indexation & Visibility

Your directory profile often ranks in Google for branded and non-branded terms. This **increases your firm's SERP footprint**, giving you more real estate on Page 1 and making it easier for potential clients to find you—even if they’re not searching directly for your site.

# ✅ 4. Boost Local SEO with High-Authority Citations

Legal directories like Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, and Martindale-Hubbell act as structured citations—key elements in local SEO. These listings confirm your firm's name, address, phone number (NAP), and practice areas across the web. Google uses this consistency to verify and trust your business, improving your Google Business Profile rankings.

**Bottom Line:**  
Directories aren’t just about leads—they’re about **trust, consistency, and visibility**. As part of a broader SEO strategy, they help build the foundation that gets your site ranked and trusted.

> I think you didn't quite catch what I wrote. Time keeping is already integrated into the CLM. In Clio, I select my client and then push the "send email" button. It will automatically create a billable entry. I have document automation integrated into Clio... I select my client and then select the "Draft Petition" button and it will automatically draft a petition and create a billable entry.

I don't see how paying for an entirely separate system will help at all. What time will I save? The billable entry is already recorded on the client's invoice.

For billable entries that are manually recorded and take place outside of clio, I am very skeptical that you can do what you claim you can do in an efficient manner. If I'm researching case law on LexisAdvance, how will you know what client it's for? How will you account for interruptions and phone calls, and when my boss walks into my office?

There is a reason attorneys record their time throughout the day as they work on things. Trying to remember what you did for every 6 minute increment throughout the entire workday is literally impossible.

I wouldn't even trust myself to approve the AI generated summary. What if it misses something for one client, and bills it to the wrong client? I honestly probably won't even catch the mistake even with your AI generated summary. I will only know I made the mistake when some angry client calls my office to complain he is getting billed for work that was completed for other clients. How embarrassing that would be...

Honestly, is this even solving a problem that I have? I don't think so. The more I think about this... This doesn't even seem like a solution at all. This is not even a solution searching for a problem. This seems like a software that will create even more work for me and should be avoided at all costs.

> Agree with all of the advice here to focus on the fundamentals! 

Something I don't see mentioned here yet is that there's a huge opportunity available now that hasn't been as prevalent in past recessions - AI & automations. During times that you have extra team bandwidth bc of client churn, focus on establishing clear SOPs in Playbooks that show the workflow and steps, and automate the heck out of them. Build agents that support client & team member onboarding and ongoing support. You'll increase your efficiency, and then be able to focus your team's new bandwidth on the personal touches that strengthen client relationships & trust. All the want-to-dos you've always wished you could do to improve the client experience, but sacrificed for the have-to-dos. Casual check-ins, phone calls, text messages, handwritten thank you cards, celebrations, strategy development, ideation... these things are what we all wish we could expand but deprioritize for the sake of the actual service delivery. It feels like overhead, when in reality these are the things that make the bond with the client sticky. This is just scratching the surface - the ability to activate your team on activities that add value, help with retention/upsell, or even getting them involved earlier in the sales process, so much opportunity.

Back to the fundamentals - for marketing & sales focus on filling up the calendar with conversations, both with potential clients and potential referral partners. Seek out potential referral partner relationships (those who work with your audience in the same or alternative capacity). Establish a referral partner program so you stay top of mind with people who also serve your ideal clients, and so you can easily refer to them as well. Make sure you're able to clearly communicate who you help and the problem you solve so it's easy for everyone to know when someone is a good fit for you.

> Here is my concern. 

All this AI outreach and automated messaging, emails, etc. is a short cut. You gain being able to scale but you lose a lot of people who simply don’t like the idea of getting cold outreach with AI.

The big concern should be competitors who understand that this is a people business.   


Marketing deals in human behavior - trying to define a behavior (buy now, download, whatever CTA) then produce/induce that behavior among a group (target market) of people with all of their emotional baggage, distrust, need to connect, biases and more. 

  
That competitor that uses meat intelligence to make prospects feel a connection (trust) based on authenticity will have an advantage. 

Perhaps the scalability is enough to offset this competitive advantage?

My other concern is that LLMs (let’s call it what it is) aren’t very good at human interaction. For example, think of using a chatbot for tech support. In all my years, I’ve never been able to get anywhere - same with AI powered phone trees “I’m sorry. I didn’t catch that…”

Maybe if you were selling a cheap, transactional type of service or product and were really well targeted it could work.

If I were looking for more current trends to capitalize on I might think about social channels /UGC like Reddit, Quora that are doing well in SERPs and seem to be key to keeping knowledge graphs up to date.

I’d also try to think more about where the next oppts are as behavior shifts to using LLMs in daily life. Surprisingly low adoption so far, but those subscriptions will be as important as phone plans in a few years.

> If I had to boil it down, I would say: stop teaching them how to be machines because AI is already better at that.

In my view, what grads and juniors will need in the next few years does not have much to do with how to build a perfect slide or how to crunch a model in Excel faster..... They will still learn those things, but that won't be the edge anymore. 

The edge will be in the stuff that AI cannot (yet, or maybe never) do well:

- Reading a room when the politics are thick enough to choke on
- Asking the awkward question no one else will
- Seeing the pattern in the mess when there is no dataset yet
- Framing a problem in a way that makes a C-level exec actually listening instead of checking their phone (true story!!)

We should be teaching them how to use AI to clear the grunt work fast, then spend the freed-up time doing the real work: thinking, persuading, building trust, getting decisions made, etc

This is pretty much the kind of shift I wrote about [in here](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr): what keeps you valuable when the technical skills that once set you apart are suddenly just the baseline. Because in 1–3 years, the people who thrive in consulting will be the ones who can turn ambiguity into confidence and get humans to act......... not the ones who can make the prettiest Gantt chart.

> Beating up your attorneys won’t solve the issue.

My previous firm went through this. 

1) first they hired an “office manager” that brought big corp/big law style drama into our little firm.


That didn’t help matters at all and now the owner of this little 3 attorney firm is paying a full time position for someone whose only job is nag and harass attorneys about “their KPIs” and makes them waste time with a whole new layer of meetings and bureaucracy.

2) then he hired a “customer relationship manager”, in other words a 25 year old dude that picks up the phone and books meetings.

Did I mention that we also have a receptionist that picks up the phone and books meetings?  Did I mention both usually end passing the phone calls to the paralegals anyway? 

That’s another role/extra mouth to feed. 

3) then they began screeching about KPIs,case turnover and all that.  We have never had an issue with case turnover, we were a lean and mean firm! But now the “office manager” has to justify his job, and that means harassing the lawyers and paralegals. And now we have an “office manager” and a “CRM specialist” who are just overhead, so we gotta BILL BILL BILL!

4) so the firm’s owner decided it was time to cut costs… FINALLY! Ok, good, we will be back on track 🙂…. Wait, how is he going to cut costs? By doing the same greedy little thing you suggested, he fired an attorney and one parelegal so he could hire 3 “virtual paralegals” based in India and Philippines and a “foreign attorney” from India who does the stuff and sends it to the other attorneys to review because he can’t really do the attorney job without a US license, so now there is even more stuff on the (real) attorney’s plate, who are already getting choked by the ridiculous KPIs and harassment they’re subject to because they have to pay for the overhead cause by the office manager and the CRM guy.

Guess how the firm is doing now? Hint; I got the heck out of there because it’s a sinking ship. They were just fine from a profitability perspective and from a legal quality perspective until these “amazing optimizations” and “improvements in efficiency” were implemented.

Last I heard this firm is not worried about their rapidly declining profitability because “they will use AI to improve efficiency”, so I guess they are firing a paralegal or two, maybe even an attorney, “ai and smart forms will do it all”.

> I used Ruby when they first launched years ago. Wasn’t a huge call center then and there were assigned receptionists (team) to our account. 90% of the time we got one of the team receptionists…during higher caller volume or overflow it was someone else but no issues. Sold that business and don’t know if they continued with them or not. But used them for a couple years. 

Switched to a local provider for current business. Prices for Ruby have gone up, sure. It wasn’t 24/7/365 coverage back then nor did we need that. We don’t have that now from the current local provider, either. But you expect people to pay $3.50 a minute for overage on a starter or entry level plan? Or $2.25 on a basic plan? Your pricing of your packages is completely inconsistent. Where did you go to business school? Also where is your HIPAA compliance policy? PCI compliance policy? I would absolutely pay Ruby MORE for peace of mind and not worrying about the inherent liability. Are you receptionists bilingual?

Your site also mentions a dedicated personal receptionist “coming soon” and suggests we sign up and pay now to get on the waiting list. So it’s like Ruby used to except they did a small team? I’d consider paying your prices if the person(s) were dedicated.

We pay less now than your rates and have dedicated person(s) and don’t have any compliance concerns. If you offer a demo or trial I’d give you a shot as I have no idea what your backend looks like. I hope the client portal isn’t designed like your Wordpress site. Also hope it’s not an off the shelf solution that will have integration issues. 

Not trying to crap on your company…just was pointing out your pricing is grandiose. But I guess it makes sense if you putting yourself in the same league as Ruby, Abby, Smith AI, Nexa etc.. Correct me if I’m wrong, but are you on that level? If so, congrats.

> My response is anecdotal, but I’ve seen this movie play out. About 10 years ago (around 2015), I attended a small-firm / solo practitioner tech show run by a state bar association (US State). Most case-management vendors there were locally hosted. Only one was cloud-first: Clio. The on-prem vendors spent a surprising amount of time bad-mouthing “the cloud.” It got borderline absurd. Some were using Google Drive and Google Cloud interchangeably, warning lawyers that Google was mining their data, and citing Gmail ads as “proof.” I personally believed the cloud was inevitable, but at the time I could not convince most small firms that cloud convenience would win out long-term.

Fast-forward \~10 years. Same conference :There is exactly one self-hosted case-management vendor left. They’re still there largely because 90% of their customers are in that state, they still accept paper checks, and they’re running a very healthy lifestyle business (I chatted with the owner).

Meanwhile, Clio is now the legal-tech darling with massive scale and late-stage funding.

So my takeaway:If you plan to keep this as a niche or lifestyle business, a fully offline / local-only solution absolutely has a market. If you plan to scale, cloud (or at least some hybrid) is almost unavoidable. Security arguments eventually lose to convenience. Not because lawyers stop caring about confidentiality, but because workflow gravity wins. If your product won’t trade some risk for speed and convenience, another one will.  
That said, I think your best option is not either/or: Local storage vs Cloud, Private or single-tenant hosted LLMs, Optional offline mode. It might be a combination of both.

A pure desktop, compute-heavy AI product runs into very real friction: Aging laptop,Locked-down IT environments, Firms that can approve case budgets but not hardware upgrades

At that point you’re selling not just software, but fighting IT policy and capital budgets. So yes, “fully offline” is a real selling point , just not a mass-market one. The trick is deciding whether you want to optimize for control and certainty, or scale and convenience, and designing the product so you don’t paint yourself into a corner. While the cloud only (i.e. public LLM) has a lot of players, you might have a niche with desktop and a different flavor with a private hosted version.

> I was also very indecisive as a 3L, and chose to pursue estate planning and administration. 

There’s two different areas of estate planning: taxable estates and non taxable estates. Taxable estate planning is extremely complex, and one of the most difficult areas of law in my opinion. They say you won’t truly grasp it until your several years in. 
Non taxable is honestly fairly easy. Because of this, non taxable estate planning doesn’t pay well, and it’s difficult to break into firms that exclusively do taxable estates, but they do pay well. 

Either way, the ceiling as an associate is not nearly as high as in litigation and corporate. 

Family life is okay. A hell of a lot less stress and deadlines in estate planning. 

Can’t answer about tacking on other areas of law really. 

For this area, I’d recommend a smaller flat-fee firm that specializes in estate planing, and where you don’t have to worry about billable hour requirements. 

I debate every week whether or not I wish I chose a different area of law out of law school. The work can be a little robotic and I’m afraid of AI replacing a lot of the work. And even the tax work isn’t as stimulating — I feel asleep. 

I miss litigation, but it’s always easy to get into litigation. Estate planning — not so much.

	2.	Collaborate with you on prompt design to achieve better, faster, or more targeted results.
	3.	Periodically review your usage patterns and suggest improvements or experiments.
	4.	Keep an eye on trends, tips, and new ideas from the ChatGPT community (Reddit, blogs, etc.).
	5.	Serve as a place to explore new AI applications or reflect on your AI journey.

Communication Style:
	•	Collaborative, conversational, and efficient.
	•	Help you capture your stream-of-consciousness thoughts and organize them when needed.
	•	Offer gentle nudges when patterns emerge (e.g., over-reliance on one project, under-use of another).

If I do not know an answer to something, I will not try to fill in the gaps by making something up that could turn into a hallucination. Rather, I will say that I don’t know.

I have access to the Internet and will search for current or precise information when appropriate. Whenever I provide information based on external sources, I will cite the source clearly (including the website or publication name and a link when possible) so that you can verify the information independently. If I am uncertain, cannot find a reliable source, or the information is based solely on my training data, I will explicitly say “I don’t know” or suggest further verification. I prioritize accuracy, transparency, and clear sourcing over completion or speculation.

> Maybe the answer is to focus on building other skills until you can leave or you can try education. Before you bring up the topic again, consider their side (use your lawyering skills). 

Maybe they don’t want to do it because they have no written privacy policy and so would be in for it with the malpractice insurance if there is ever an issue. And yes, if anyone at the firm is using the free version of most LLMs then you cannot guarantee client privacy. 
Maybe they don’t want to put notice of AI use in their retainer letter because they don’t know how to answer a client questioning why they should get paid if they can just have AI do it. (This is a good one for you to articulate for yourself as you may have to sell future clients on why you choose to use AI and how it makes you more valuable to them as a lawyer instead of less. And speed, low cost can’t be the answer because then the even faster/cheaper option is to do it themselves.)
Maybe they assume that all you have to do is ask a magic question, and your perfectly drafted motion pops out. Or they are afraid this isn’t actually the case, but don’t want to have to learn how to properly prep and prompt. 
Maybe they just don’t want to spend the time setting it up. 
Maybe it’s something completely random, like a grandchild’s expulsion because they plagiarized their term paper from Wikipedia back in the day. 

Could you clearly and persuasively answer all of these questions? (Plus, creating documentation, systems for training, and policies could help you wherever you go as you are likely to have more, or at least different, experience than other attorneys. And it makes for interesting interview content as it’s something that’s a value add to a firm that may have this, but incompletely. )
I think it’s worth it to see if you can actually get all their fears or concerns out. There may be issues you haven’t considered. And if you’re only seeing your side, it’s hard to change anyone’s mind.

> “Without doing the work to vet.”

“Coming from a place of fear.”

Vet what? Fear of what;?

What, specifically, should lawyers be using AI for? Name one task you know lawyers do, and how AI can assist. 

Be specific in your answers. 

I’m not trying to be a jerk here, seriously.

But what do you think lawyers are afraid of? 

What vetting has been done so far, and what further vetting is needed?

My questions highlight the central issues- which is that AI and tech companies are making tools for businesses that they have no idea about. 

I *guarantee you* that AI usage is a forgettable, negligible, irrelevant fraction of most law practices, from big law to boutique. 

I will concede lawyers are typically late adopters to technology. But the practice of law is the most durable business model in modern history- next to, like, prostitution and agriculture - for a reason. 

Imagine if firms panicked in 2018-2021 re: crypto “smart contracts” and made huge organizational changes based on that hype train. 

Or if firms, in the late 90s, stopped relying on Lexis/westlaw and instead sourced their research from forums and Wikis. 

Law practice, unlike tech work, is very specialized and its practitioners are hard to replace. The trial/ error period for adoption of new technologies is many years, maybe a decade or more, not 1-2. 

And AI maxis seem to think dropping a tool on our lap and saying “you figure it out!” on the question of actual use cases is innovation. It’s not, it’s just bloatware.

> Your third question will be of the most importance going forward. 


There are two ways that are the most practical
in protecting client attorney privledge with LLMS. 

1. Use a Different LLM for each case.  Not session; different LLM. Yes you heard that right. It’s the safest way to protect client data. It’s sprawl potential but easy to audit and easiest to assure clients that when they know you have a special AI with their name on it and no one else.

2.  Use RBAC technology where it prevents itself from using data from client A (data set A) from learning from or about or being trained by to help be smarter on client B (data set B). 

RBAC is renamed as a “client vault” on many AI legal systems. Presently these companies are not showing an audit trail and will not show what’s under the hood so the “trust me bro” tech huckster show is doing very well. It would give me pause in the buying process without thorough questioning.

It requires some expertise to setup and harden successfully. 

I am afraid this will be a huge topic in the near future, not only among very large firms that deal with cases worth tens of millions of dollars (they are already aggressively using RBAC), but will trickle down to smaller firms as the first litigation cases start to settle for client commingling.

Excellent question. 

The answer will keep evolving but today this is where we’re at.

> Hello!   
  
What would your advice be for a 19 year old joining the agency space. I started 6 months ago an agency or ai agency, in uni first year in a foreign country (Netherlands), started selling AI Chatbots and Receptionists and came quickly to the conclusion that I dont need to sell AI, but the outcome.   
  
I’ve tried cold calling, cold DMs, cold email, door 2 door, and my personal network, but haven’t landed a client yet. I don’t speak Dutch, only English and my home language, which made things harder locally. I spent the first 4–5 months focusing on real estate in the Netherlands and had conversations, but repeatedly got ditched.   
  
After that, I switched my offer to lead generation (ads + lead qualification and booking systems) for roofers in the US. At times, I’ve felt unsure whether I’m focusing on the right things or just creating activity without progress.  
  
If you were starting today with zero clients, what would you focus on first, and what would you stop doing immediately?

I should also mention that I have some small social proof: I built two websites from scratch for a small coffee shop and ran ads for it.

I’m not afraid of critique and would genuinely value a raw answer.

Appreciate your time either way.

### r/consulting — 2025-11-10 | 51pts | `blocker_trust`

> AI and Offshoring.

When I started, it was expected and encouraged to 'come up with ideas' and 'move projects' along in creative ways.

Some say that is 'work', and of course it is. But it mostly was meeting with clients off the clock. Being social. Building relationships. Finding out what they need / want / want to avoid.

My point is none of that was 'tracked' either internally by Partners or externally by PE investors who now own a ton of firms.

Also I cannot make this claim but at least in my experience, most of the Partners when I started early 2000s were 'operators' first and foremost and MBA business types second or not at all. i.e. They came from engineering, industry, etc then started successful firms post 2008. 

And I saw several MBA slick-backed hair type of Partners come and go. They *never* stuck cause they were only in it to invest a bit then get out for the next opportunity. 

Now all of our partner-firms, competitors, etc are ALL run like the latter. Everything is tracked and compared to how it can 'tell a story' to an investor.

When I started, I could spend hours coming up with ideas or pursuing roundabout ways to solve client issues. And then try them out by meeting the client face to face

Now that's not allowed because 1 minute you spend doing that is a minute you aren't tracking your billability or 'supporting' an internal 'initiative', which itself has gone through 5 rounds of debates with the financial backoffice or "strategic growth partner".

It used to be that you could try to solve an issue and if it didn't work, then the actual **consulting result** wasn't met, i.e. the deliverable wasn't good or the sale wasn't made. *THOSE* were the results. Either good or bad. If good, you're good. If result wasn't attained, you weren't doing your job and your boss or Partner knows it.

Now, everyone is afraid to try that because it's not just you're trying to develop a client and your Partner or manager saying "Oh I wanted you to make that sale to that client" or "That deliverable needs to be better" *judged solely based on the sale or deliverable*

Now whether it's good or bad isn't based on the consulting output; it's based on the organizational 'momentum'. As in does your little deck align with the overall organizational goals to make us targets for PE investment? 

"Uh I thought we make this deck or deliverable so the client gets their problem solved? As in what they're paying us to do" That's not the case anymore.

Now, it's an undefined eye in the sky of KPIs and metrics we all serve, which don't allow for any remediation or improvement. It's just "Your KPI is 70% and Bob's is 72%. You are worse". 

I think the two above AI and offshoring are both the chicken and the egg, making a perverted cycle. But consulting "we need help" will never truly die. I do think the answer for truly dedicated operators is just to go solo or start your own firm though.

This is what I'm most afraid of at the moment due to the long term impact. Not to mention the fact that junior staff slowly lose fundamentals as AI becomes more commonplace.

One of the main issues with AI at the moment is that you already need to know roughly what the answer is going to be, so that you can monitor it for hallucinations. That's fine if you're already experienced, but a junior person who is reliant on it, may not necessarily know when it has produced garbage.

Yes AI can present training material and answer all of the procedural questions like how do I sign up for 401k, how do I reset my laptop password, what dealer do I go to for company sponsored Posche lease, etc. But in my experience most of the questions new hires have are "unofficial" or "afraid to ask the big boss" questions such as how many hours of overtime are expected, what is appropriate office attire, and are body piercings permitted (all real question I've been asked). There's no way AI trained on company docs will give a truthful answer to a lot of these questions. That's the job of the line manager (or onboarding buddy) to answer these questions where the real answer may be much different than what's in the company handbook.

For clients, of cours no way.

Yes, this is how the world works - no one can give you a more accurate answer - AI might or might not replace you in the near or the not so near future but if you got into consulting the right way you shouldn't be worried about moving on from it either.

> I work in the IT field and I can tell we feel some immediate impact of such tools; now will it replace completely humans? I doubt it. 

Think of ChatGPT that everybody is crazy about, it's indeed awesome but it's trained on data collected in the internet and often times confidently gives us wrong answers. That's because it doesn't know "everything" and it won't know, even if it's daily trained (which is not) with the latest updates in the internet. 

When I'm consulting for a client, I always need their own exclusive data to reason about. We need numbers that aren't available in the internet. We can train the Davinci model from ChatGPT to understand context data, let's say data related to our clients, however the process of gathering the data is the most arduous one, and then preparing the data so finally training the model. You still need people to navigate the client through this process because AI it's not magic.

Something else I'm afraid it's gonna happen is free content will become more rare over time, because why would people be feeding an AI service with something they're experts at for free without any authorship or recognition? 

If that will be a trend, the AI won't have new meaningful data to train its models; or worse, the free content out there generated by AI, that it's used to train itself.

What we’re using is a natural sounding AI voice with real conversational pacing and empathy it’s not a clunky bot reading a script.

> PI cases take a while to settle. It's unfortunately not as simple as sending a bunch of demand letters and waiting for the money to come in. 

- You can get a settlement offer from an insurance company, but most of the time it'll be too low. It won't cover the medical bills, especially once your fee gets taken out. So the only way to get the offer to go up so it's reasonable (ie an offer the client will accept that'll cover the meds) is to file. Once you're filing, the litigation is a time-consuming waste of time. Most litigated cases get settled without going to trial, but you'll still end up doing discovery on a lot of PI cases. Tons of ATIs. PI litigation is very formulaic, the interrogatories are always the same (describe the accident, client's injuries etc) but managing litigation deadlines in a PI firm with a lot of cases is hard. The law isn't hard, but there's an art to doing PI well and it takes time. 

- Support staff is absolutely CRITICAL in PI. The best PI lawyers are the ones that have good support staff. Staff make or break a firm in any field, but esp in PI. A lot of lawyers don't really work on PI cases, it's the staff doing all the work. You don't just need staff that answer phones, you need staff that are super resilient and will stick around despite clients yelling at them 24/7 cuz they want their money immediately.

**Pros of PI:**

- No billables

- Easy to find car crash cases in a major city

- Can make decent money 

- Don't have to hound clients to get them to make a payment

- Unless the client was in PT for 6 months+, these cases don't have much paperwork. You're not dealing with 50 exhibits and 2000 pages that often. Most records & bills can be sent/uploaded electronically, which is easier to deal with.

- Don't have to go to trial that often

- Basically zero legal research or motions. If you hated Lexis/Westlaw & case briefing, PI doesn't do any of that

**Cons of PI:**

- **The clients are the WORST.** Aside from family law, PI clients are the most insufferable. They're insanely demanding and will call your office every day demanding updates every hour, and they're completely ungrateful. PI clients think *you* owe *them*, when in reality clients wouldn't get a penny from insurance without us. Clients always think PI cases will get resolved in 1 week, when they actually can take 1-2 years. They think their lawyer will just send a scary letter and insurance will give them $1m. Seriously, PI clients are awful. Pay your staff well, cuz having to deal with some of the worst clients imaginable all day is a really hard job. PI firms can burn through staff quickly cuz the clients are so demanding, and nothing's ever good enough for them. Even when we literally work for free and then give them money. 

- **PI's really redundant.** The cases are all really similar, if you're looking for excitement and variety this isn't the field for you. Sometimes you can get a big case with some serious injuries, but those are like 5% of y

> Hi! So, I graduated from law school in 2021. Ten days after graduation, my wife passed away. As you can imagine, my post-graduation employment wasn't going to work. I knocked out the bar while handling my wife's affairs and hung out a shingle in my hometown so I could help my in-laws, etc. 

Since then, it's been pretty good. I average about $2-4k/week depending on what I'm focusing on. Problem is that I spend about 10-20 hours/week drumming up more work to get into the pipeline. If you're willing to take the odd one-off projects -- such as reviewing a commercial lease for a small business for $500 -- between more complex litigation and business clients, then it's definitely workable.  
  
One note: there are incidental costs that you don't think about at first. Ooma for my office phone costs like $50/month. My domain, email service, and website are about another $100/month. Then there's your portion of the FICA taxes, whether or not you're an S-Corp. You pay for your own insurance. You get the idea.   
  
And there's always the dreaded accounts receivable issue -- some people don't like to pay their bills. One law firm I did contract work for still owes me $10,000 that I'll have to sue for most likely. That'll be a pain. 

Finally, there are emotional costs I didn't expect. It's hard to hear the schizophrenic people leave voicemails; you can hear how much they are suffering with their delusions. People struggling through addiction will cry when you tell them that their criminal charge can't be expunged/sealed. You'll never do enough pro bono work to stem the tide of need out there, but you'll feel like you can and should do more anyway.   

With that said, I feel like there's a limit on what you can do yourself without working for other attorneys. I've been feeling like an unevenly sharpened knife lately. Because I am in charge of what work I get, I naturally gravitate toward my strengths which leaves my weaknesses to atrophy further. I just finished revising my resume and plan on putting out feelers to see what's out there. My hope is that a stint with a law firm could help me polish myself into something more refined and effective. 

I hope this helps. =)

### r/VOIP — 2025-08-19 | 2pts | `general`

> Depends on the requirements and constraints 

PSTN land line gets its power from the exchange, so it'll work if there's no power to the site

To replicate that with a VOIP phone you need the phone powered by PoE  and the network kit all running on a UPS potentially backed by a generator for the extreme redundancy.

Cordless DECT phones are great, but they need power and they're radio based and as such blocked by things that interfere with radio signals (like big hunks of metal or water). So the position of the base station becomes important, but the same is true for a VOIP solution. To migrate this to VoIP you either need to use an ATA or use a (generally not cheap) DECT VOIP device like a Gigaset or Yealink DECT device.

VOIP devices have firmware and an end of life and end of support constraint. Depending on how they connect you may run into obsolescence and need to replace them every five years. You have configurations to manage, password to periodically rotate, etc. A PSTN phone just plugs in and works.

You need to account for infrastructure, what wiring is kn place, is if cat3, cat5, cat5e, cat6, etc. Is this routed to the right place.   Are you upgrading an older hotel and need to connect all those room phones using a 24 or 48 port ATA, or can you replace all those phones and replicate the required functionality by programming those phones.

Are you linking multiple locations together, do you need to centralize calling.

Do you need to enable calling between multiple devices, or call parking, paging, intercom, conferences (3-way, or more), call transfers, voicemail, call recording, etc. Do you have faxes to deal with, alarm systems, older monitoring systems (had a sewage treatment plant that needed a phone line via VOIP once), health alert systems, etc.

What's the connectivity throughput and minimum bandwidth guarantees. Do they need encrypted calls? Do they have a good quality router where SIP ALGs can be turned off.

Is it easier to give people just a mobile or an eSIM instead.

There are so many considerations, constraints, and requirements for both the home or a business. Deciding which is better is not easy to answer.

Ideally you want to do VOIP, it makes things simple in some ways, but harder in others. You need more computer networking understanding for it, whilst a PSTN is trivial.

Debugging call issues with the PSTN is trivial, a volt meter and a landline phone or linesmans handset is enough.

Debugging VOIP calls can involve network packet captures and digging through the SIP and RTP/SRTP traffic. But it could also be an ALG, DNS, STUN/TURN/ICE, network issues, etc

What are the requirements, what are you trying to achieve, what are the constraints. Those questions will help you decide.

Note: I've been building VOIP phone systems for nearly 20 years now, with a variety of PSTN integrations.

> Figure out how to try the AI receptionist before any long term commitments. 

All the ones we demo have not been good enough for prime time, but they can serve a purpose for overflow/nights/weekends. Meaning they are still better than voicemail. 

I’ve never demoed the one mentioned in this thread. I thought the tech wasn’t quite there yet, but maybe it is just the deployment of said tech.

> It feels weird to fire a client, but oftentimes it's the right thing to do. It's a two-way street. As an agency owner, you should want to business with those who value your services, and where you value their relationship.

I've got a couple instances where, over the course of 17 years of running an agency, I fired a client. It's so  liberating to get rid of "Karen the Clients". They usually email/demand something, and then leave voicemail messages later in the day asking about the status of their demands. 

The final straw for me for one "Karen the Client" is when she replied-all to their entire organization, saying how my team and I never followed up with her request from months prior. This was in February. Her original request was received over Christmas break, and was followed up with next business day, with a request for more information.

Two months goes by and she never replied with the information request we had. When she finally did her reply-all rant, I had had enough. 

After careful though, I crafted a polite email to her and the rest of organization that we no longer wished to business with them. We gave them three or four months to find another provider.

Two or three months later, a local competitor of ours asked for us to release the domain name to them and help with transferring the content. They were taking over the account. (yay!)

At the time I was living in a small town and we all know who our competitors are. I told the new agency that I'd stop their office and help. Then I gave them the scoop about why "Karen the Client" was leaving us...because I fired her and she was a PITA. I figured it was good to let the new agency should know what they're getting into.

> I concur with your conclusion. I am a retired CPA, currently serving on one local board on a volunteer basis. The invitation to serve on a board and receive compensation seemed like an opportunity worth discussing, so I scheduled a call today at 3:00 pm EDT. 

This morning I received 2 separate emails, reminding me of my 1:00 pm phone appointment. So, I concluded that they shifted me from 3 pm to 1 pm. Unprofessional, but ok. 

I was prepared to receive their phone call at 1:00 pm, as their email stated. NO CALL!

So, at 3:30, I noticed that I had a voicemail from this company at 3 pm. The caller referred to his call for our “prearranged” call at 3 pm, as if to suggest that I failed to honor my appointment time. 

I called him then, and he apologized for the confusion…He proceeded to run me through the pitch, including the eye opening compensation and limited time required to earn these board fees. 

I informed him that I truly possess the credentials that I mentioned, however I was curious how this company is able to do the necessary background check on these candidates. How do they know I’m representing my background honestly? 

His answer was weak, referring to various social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook. 

I was waiting for the sales pitch- and sure enough it surfaced. $195 up front, month to month contract. I knew it was a scam. 

I asked him who pays the insurance premiums for board of directors liability coverage. He had no idea what I was talking about.

I explained what this coverage is, and he said, “well I guess that’s on us”…!

I politely ended the call- and decided to see if this company had been covered on Reddit. 

Thanks for sharing- I hope other possible victims are able to read these comments and avoid the financial drain. 

It sounded too good to be true. And it is!

With all services, every now and then they'll bungle a call, and you will need to set up rules for call handling and answering questions. One thing I appreciate about BOB is that they make it easy to tweak instructions.

No service is perfect, but neither are most full-time employee receptionists. I have someone do a mystery call every now and then, with me listening, just to check quality. 

Someone else mentioned how people will usually be happier to leave a message with a human than to leave a voicemail, and I agree. Many times I've heard people say mine was the first firm that actually answered the call, and how that made a difference to them.

> Do you think you were the victim of a bait and switch regarding the job you thought you were applying to? Or, once you were in the interview, did they determine that you don't have the skills they need for a legal assistant so they then pivoted to discussing a mailroom position? The distinction makes a big difference. If you applied to a job posted as "legal assistant" but they started off right away discussing a mailroom job, that's not a good sign and I probably wouldn't proceed with them. 

If it's the latter and they said something like, "I don't think your skills and experience match with our needs for a legal assistant at this point, but we're willing to move forward with a mailroom position," then that means they see something in you even though you might not be a fit for the original position. That would be a different story and I might consider moving forward.

Law firms can be great places to work and grow, and in my experience they often prefer promoting from within (it's easier to hire a new mailroom assistant or receptionist than an experienced legal assistant or paralegal). I've seen this happen many times. So it's completely reasonable that this could happen to you if you get the job. But remember job interviews are a two-way street. Dig into that a little more if you get a second interview and ask them how often they do promote from within, and make it clear to them that this is important to you. If they seem honest and sincere and you feel comfortable with the folks you've met and the answers to your questions, you might want to consider moving forward.

> Longtime manager of a corporate law firm here. Corporate firms are generally pretty traditional places as far as dress code and expected behavior, and a very different atmosphere than what you've seen on TV. If you have questions about what to wear, I'd ask whomever hired you (HR manager or office manager, I'm guessing) for guidance. Observe how others are dressed and don't try to stand out. Err on the conservative side until you've been there a while and get an idea of what they consider acceptable.

If you're going to be the receptionist, your first obligation is to be dependable. Be unfailingly on time. Be pleasant and polite, but not too chatty. Once you get the lay of the land and are comfortable with your primary responsibilities, make yourself useful to others. If you see other staff members in the weeds, offer to help them. Assistants and paralegals often need help making copies, scanning documents, preparing mail, making file folders and binders, etc. Let them know they can rely on you and earn their trust.

Be a team player and be proactive. No job is too small, especially when you're starting out.

Don't be afraid to ask questions when you're learning the ropes, but take notes and be careful to not ask the same question repeatedly. Law firms are busy places and people are usually generous with helping out new folks, but that will wear thin quickly if you don't retain what you've been told.

Very importantly, be sure to take a beat and proofread your emails before sending in order to keep typos and grammar mistakes to a minimum, and make sure to communicate clearly.

Law firms are fantastic places to grow. Good luck to you! I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park.

### r/LawFirm — 2026-01-20 | 11pts | `blocker_not_ready`

> A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: 

First, get a "virtual office" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. 

Second, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. 

Third, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. 

Finally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.

> I think the main problem is that you will have a very hard time attracting your ideal of "institutional clients or sophisticated defendants charged with white collar crimes".

If I'm in their shoes, I would want a lawyer who is very experienced in white collar crime (you only have 5 years as a lawyer), someone who has support with paralegals or associate lawyers (so they can handle it if the case gets big with lots of witnesses or documents), someone who has experience in the local legal market so they have relationships with the prosecutors to have a better chance at making deals (you're a transplant so you don't know the prosecutors), and someone who they can get a referral for from a friend/colleague/the other lawyers that they pay instead of just picking a name out of Google (you don't have a local network). 

I don't know why these clients would pick you, instead of a lawyer who meets more of those criteria. The only thing you might be able to compete on clearly is price, but these clients have money and would probably prefer to pay more if they got a better perceived chance of success in their criminal case. I can't see a handful of internet ads you pay for changing any of that.

If your plan was more a more general criminal law focus, I think you'd be ok. You might also try to push federal criminal defense as a subspeciality, in my state it's often notably harder to find a lawyer to practice in federal court compared to state court.

If you want some complexity to keep yourself interested, dip your toes into 1983 civil rights cases. A certain percent of your generic criminal law clients will have viable cases, plus you can try to network in your criminal defense lawyer groups for these sort of referrals (the vast majority just refer these cases out).

Also, you need some sort of actual or virtual receptionist to field calls for you.  If people call and they get a voicemail, they usually hang up instead of leaving a message.

> What's your practice area, and what size of city are you in?

When I started out the only thing that worked right away was Google Ads. I made less on those files, but made sure to get good reviews. Within a year I was top of the map pack in my practice area for my city (smallish city). You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick. Also, always ask for a review (unless you mess things up -- in which case I always [only happened once] give full refund and complete work).

I have an SEO guy now. I went through SO MANY, it was frustrating. But finding a good one was worth it. I would strongly caution against a falt-fee or retainer model -- they just pump out AI slop. I pay hourly and we have targets in mind (organic clicks). SEO is pretty great once it's done right, but it does take forever, and I spent way too much on what probably weren't technically scams, but that felt that way. 

I tried to make FB ads work. They are so cheap, but I could never convert them. 

Oh, and here's the industry standard as far as I know for setting calls. You need a receptionist. It's a free consultation to speak to the receptionist, who bills CC for a paid intake call with you. Don't speak to clients for free, or they essentially never close (unless your PI, I don't know how that works). You can get an assistant/receptionist part time, just post on indeed. But you will have to figure out payroll if you do.

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

> Thank you so much for sharing this info and it is really cool that your post has received so much attention.  

It sounds like you have a solid system that is by far working well.  I think you shouldn't mess with it too much.  Often making small changes to nudge a metric can make something else tank.  You have an advantage tracking so many metrics that you'll probably catch that fast, though.  I just think that the gain for the effort is probably low return unless you are for sure scaling up next year.

FWIW I pay $10 a month for my north american 24/7/365 virtual receptionist.  If I get more than 1 call a month, they charge me $10 a call.  I mostly get sales calls, but they don't charge me for gatekeeping those.  They're a solid service as well.  If I wanted to, I could have them walk somebody through the intake form, book an appointment on my Calendly, or even run a conflict check through my Clio contacts.  They would charge for it, and I don't have them do that, but it is nice to know they have the capability should I need it one day.

I've worked with a lot of solo and small firms and the ones consistently successful at bringing in new business that were not referrals had an on-staff intake person.  Some do it with VR and others with an IVR setup similar to yours.  I've yet to come across a firm with a non-attorney running their initial intake that averages less than 14 new matters a month.

The biggest difference is they only work with law firms. Smith was fine but their receptionists handle calls for dentists, plumbers, everyone - so they never really understood the nuances of legal intake. Claire's team actually knows what questions to ask for a PI consult vs a family law matter without me having to spell everything out.

Customer service has been night and day too. When I need to update my call script or tweak something, I actually get a response same day. With Smith I'd wait 3-4 days sometimes and then they'd still get it wrong.

Setup was super easy and my intake quality went way up. I'm a solo PI attorney so every lead matters - can't afford to have someone botch the first impression.

> The biggest thing I look for in a legal assistant (receptionist too) is willingness to learn - like actually learn why we do something, so that you can appropriately do it later - common sense, and initiative. That’s most of what it takes for that kind of job, plus people skills. Write things down and ask good questions (ex. Less “I know you showed me this yesterday, can you show me again?” and more “I know you showed me this yesterday, but we did X - since this matter is different because of [whatever], does that change anything?”).

As for people skills, remember that you need to be polite and professional, but you are not being paid enough to handle emotional abuse. If you are being yelled at, remember that you will have all of the knowledge, and none of the power. So either clients can listen while you tell them how to help themselves, or they can call you back when they’re ready to have a professional conversation with you. Sometimes clients just want to yell and be heard, and then they calm down. If they don’t calm down after minute or two of you validating their feelings and moving along to a solution, it’s time to tell them to call you back when they’re ready to discuss the matter with you. Allowing them to continue to yell at you will, by and large, get you nowhere.

> 1. During training, take detailed notes about your training and refer back to those notes before asking for help. Keep taking notes as you learn so you can keep referring back to them, rather than asking the same questions again because you’ve forgotten.

2. Take initiative and ownership of the firm’s success. When I was a legal assistant at a small firm I became invested in then success of the partner I worked for. Being bought in made me a better employee and that partner valued that I was looking out for them and trying to anticipate their needs. In the receptionist context, this means getting ahead of daily tasks, getting answers for clients that you can take back to them, and asking legal assistants and paralegals what you can take off their plate, which will increase your own value to the firm and broaden your skills. 

3. Attention to detail. Proof your emails and anything you write before you send or submit anything. Take good notes when relaying any messages to clients.

4. ^ Goes with the last one but CYA. Clients will absolutely misrepresent things you tell them - sometimes intentionally. Having notes of those interactions and action items resulting from those interactions will help protect the firm and protect yourself.

5. Find a way to manage your to-dos. If you use Microsoft or a Google suite I utilized tasks/reminders with a color coded system. Green meant complete; yellow meant in progress; and red meant to be done. I also used calendar reminders all the time to make sure I kept up with deadlines and reviewed what was ahead for the week on Monday morning to best situate myself.

6. Positivity is contagious. You are the voice and face for the firm. Being courteous and upbeat goes a long way.

Best of luck!

We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.

In our case though, our firm needed something more intake-focused rather than just receptionist support. We looked into a few options that could replicate a proper intake call and eventually tried Arka AI, which handled deeper intake more like a paralegal would.

For us, the goal was to make the client experience smoother — so they don’t have to follow up multiple times or repeat the same information. That’s ultimately why we went with a service like this.

Once you start down that path, revenue attribution becomes meaningless. GAAP accounting is very clear: attorney work is direct revenue, and paralegal work is support that improves capacity and efficiency. It has real value, but not by slicing up revenue in a way that ignores basic business principles. Profitability is measured by accurate attribution and margin analysis, not by philosophical revenue-sharing.

> You need to formalize ownership and gatekeeping on your matters, in writing, and add a simple approval workflow.

Action plan:

\- Email the partner and that para: for my files, all opposing counsel comms go through me; filings sit in a Ready to File folder until I approve; 24-hour turnaround; 15‑minute weekly huddle to review deadlines. Put the matter number in every subject and use a clear naming rule for drafts vs finals.

\- Track errors in a neutral log; after two weeks, take the data and the workflow to the partner as “this protects clients and the firm,” not a personality fight.

\- Designate the receptionist as your file coordinator with limited authority (calendaring, service, medical records, follow‑ups). Cheaper than burning attorney time.

\- Self‑manage only high‑risk items (court filings, OC calls) until trust is earned; everything else runs through your checklist.

\- Bridge hire: pitch a contract/fractional para 10–15 hrs/week for 90 days with KPIs (cycle times, zero missed deadlines). Full‑time para makes sense once you consistently collect 2.5–3x their total cost and you’re at \~120–150 active WC files or 3+ trials/month.

On tools: I’ve used Clio and DocuSign, but SignWell’s templates and sequential routing cut our retainer/med‑auth back‑and‑forth and unclogged bottlenecks.

Formalize ownership and workflows now so you can serve clients and avoid burnout.

You need to be paid for all the work you do, and work means anything you’re doing during work hours that you wouldn’t be doing if you were unemployed. The time you spend entering your billing, dealing with IT issues, installing updates, attending all hands meetings, discussing or planning your weekly schedule, being mentored, organizing your inbox, filing, tidying your desk, changing your passwords because the IT guy told you to, downloading a new program, covering phones for the receptionist when they have a bio break, listening to your boss talk about their golf game, reading legal news updates or cases that just came out that are relevant to your field, that all goes into admin time. And you get paid for it.

> I’ve leased on and off with them throughout the years. It’s good for a space with a body at the front desk. If your business needs that, and you aren’t there all the time, that’s about all it’s worth. At my centers I was billed extra for all sorts of stuff, had to fight over those bills, and the rules constantly change without notice. The free community meeting room became a poorly decorated interior office, which was embarrassing to show to clients. The receptionists change frequently and without notice. The dishwasher in my most recent place has been broken for more than half the time I’ve been there. The plastic cups for clients don’t exactly scream professional. I’m leaving asap.

> Regus worked for us as a startup, but we quickly (within 1 year) had to get a real office due to the Google maps/marketing needs and all kinds of issues. Also they really nickle and dime ya over everything. They tried charging us ridiculous pricing for a phone line they didn’t even answer (We had it forwarded because their receptionists were so bad). We had to fight over charges not revealed in any contract, not given notification of, and Regus themselves couldn’t/wouldn’t actually give us a breakdown of how the charges were calculated. After threat of legal action, we parted ways and they tried to assign collections. More legal threats and they finally gave up.

It’ll work if you need an address and a decent looking office space to meet clients. But once you get going after 6-12 months and have some money coming in, jump to a real office immediately.

> I used to own a firm and had a legal assistant I paid but then also paid extra to do personal stuff outside the firm because she had four kids and was a single mom and needed more money. So it was always - “this pay is for work for the firm, and this is for pay from me personally.” We ended up moving to a fully hybrid personal assistant/legal assistant-receptionist deal because then I could pay her everything as a W-2. But the expectations have to be EXTREMELY clear.

> There's nothing obnoxious about hiring a personal assistant. What's obnoxious is hiring a legal assistant, receptionist, or other law firm staff and then expecting that person to do personal tasks like picking up dry cleaning.

It's a common problem in very small firms - especially if there's two partners and they're married to each other! - for the owner/partners to fail to maintain enough separation between their personal and professional lives.  It causes drama and dissatisfaction.  Don't ask your legal secretary to do personal errands; the secretary will resent doing them and your partner will resent paying for them.  If personal services are what you need the most help with, hire a personal assistant, on your own dime not the firm's; be clear about your expectations, treat the assistant with respect and pay them well.  

Also don't ask either a legal assistant or a personal assistant to clean the office.  Get a janitor for that.

> I’ve been in a similar spot — hiring and training assistants can be a lot, especially if someone leaves unexpectedly. A virtual receptionist can take some pressure off by making sure calls are always answered and messages are handled, but traditional services can add up quickly.

One option I’ve been using is [**Ring-Ready.com**](http://Ring-Ready.com), which is an AI receptionist. It answers and screens calls 24/7, forwards when needed, and clients honestly think it’s a real person. For me it’s been a good middle ground between hiring more staff and keeping overhead low.

> Agreed, it should never be this way. I ran a firm for years before switching to back-office support services. The lack of places trying for a warm transfer as the first touch point is awful. I also blame the consultants that push capturing too many metrics for "the benefit of the firm's KPIs."

It needs to be simple:

- Incoming call
- Answer
- Name
- Warm transfer to attorney, allowing attorney to accept, reject, or have receptionist relay a message. 
- If no answer from attorney, then take a message. 
- If it's a new client, book a consultation within a predefined block of time to lock them in and prevent a subsequent call to the next firm on the list. 

The firm's ideal client also dictates this procedure. If your clients are generating $50k in billable hourly fees each year, they should be calling your direct line. If you run a pre litigation PI firm, there should definitely be a receptionist to run interference. 

If your an attorney sending me a referral, I want an email, text, or a direct call to my cell phone.

> I am a paralegal.  What I did today included (but was not limited to) attending a weekly practice group coordination meeting, reviewing an updated closing checklist received from lender counsel and emailing her a document that was done but hadn't been sent to her yet, conferring with an associate about an unusual tax issue in a contract we're working on together and making some revisions to the contract, responding to an email from a client about a minor change he wants to the draft contract I sent him last week, drafting an operating agreement amendment and a couple of authorizing resolutions and sending them to my supervising attorney for review before they go to lender counsel.  Next on my list is drafting an easement agreement, which I'll send to a different supervising attorney for review before it goes to the client. 



I've been doing this work for a long time, but even less experienced paralegals should not be spending a lot of time answering calls, making copies, and scanning.  It sounds like you want a secretary/legal assistant, or possibly just a receptionist or file clerk.  And if you're constantly asking paralegals to do admin support work, it's not terribly surprising that they've just stopped responding to you.  Although based on your description of the general situation in your organization, I have to wonder, who hired these paralegals, what *is* their actual job description, and how are their duties assigned?  It's unlikely that they truly aren't doing *anything*, so what is it that they *are* doing and why is it invisible to you and other lawyers?  Presumably in a nonprofit you don't have the billable/nonbillable distinctions that generally separate paralegals from LAs, and you may very well not have an abundance of staff so the job descriptions of those you do have may need to be hybrid.  But clearly there's a mismatch of expectations.  And you're not going to resolve that without involving whatever the higher management level is in your company - the general counsel, perhaps, or whoever is the administrator of the legal department.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-06-24 | 24pts | `general`

> Actually just worked on a project where we tried to Define and write down the specific job duties for legal secretaries and paralegals.    

Some of this is going to be very specific to the environment.  For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. 

What we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training 

Attorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. 

Second, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. 


A really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. 

However getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done. At the beginning it will definitely take longer because you are having to teach someone how to do it rather than simply do it yourself. 

With that said a good paralegal should be able to
- keep files in order and ensure new items are filed correctly. 
- keep up with notes and summaries enabling an attorney to catch up on a file quickly 
- draft simple documents like cover letters and rote pleadings from forms for your approval.  (You dont need to be a lawyer to write "the defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 7" over and over again). 
- calendar deadlines
- work on service of process 


If you are the manager. Think about 5 tasks that you feel like waste your time and keep you from doing productive work.  Write down step by step directions for those tasks and then talk to a paralegal. 

If you are a junior person in a larger entity, talk to partners/managers about what the paralegals do.  They might already ve occupied or feel that they give partners tasks priority.

It may not be the job for her but unfortunately this is apart of her job responsibilities. I had a paralegal like that and I should’ve stopped it much sooner than I did. There needs to be enough money to hire a receptionist. It’s possible that there is and isn’t. It’s something to explore but it’s either there’s money for it or you let the current paralegal go and hire someone that’s a better fit.

> been using virtual assistants for our firm for about a year now - definitely worth considering.

pros:
- huge cost savings vs full-time employee
- no benefits, office space, or equipment costs
- can get specialized skills (legal experience, specific software)
- flexibility to scale hours up/down

cons:

- finding quality ones is a pain - most are basic call center level
- security/confidentiality concerns with sensitive client info
- takes time to train on your specific processes

for law firms specifically, you really need someone who understands professional services and can handle confidential information properly.

what's worked for us is going through a service that pre-vets candidates specifically for professional services. we found someone who has previous legal admin experience and excellent communication skills. way better than the generic virtual receptionist companies.

the cost difference is massive - we're paying like 60% less than a full-time assistant but getting someone who's actually more skilled in certain areas.

given you're going from 2 to 1 assistant, a virtual one could help bridge that gap without the full overhead.

what kind of call volume and admin tasks are you looking to cover?

**Pros:**   
No missed calls = no missed clients  
Way cheaper than hiring full-time  
Handles intake, scheduling, basic Qs, frees up your assistant

**Cons:**  
Complex/legal Qs may still need you or your team

Tip: If calls are eating your time or your assistant’s, start with a receptionist just for phone coverage. You’ll know fast if it’s worth it.

I’m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.

Within the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn’t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.

6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person. I was finally comfortable spending 4k a month on a PI membership and the 1,400 on my criminal membership but my key account person got me a better deal I got the combo membership for only 4,600/month. The criminal clients are paying for this membership and then some. On the PI membership some of the clients are very good a lot are trash, but, the day a case came in involving a Walmart truck that killed someone I jumped on it and I settled for 7.5 million from that case. Now I’m taking PI statewide and Criminal only in the metropolitan I live in.

Anyone who says this didn’t work for them. It’s because they didn’t work the program. I have notifications on for my mobile app, my secretary is logged in on her phone and computer and I get emails. The two of us click on every new case as soon as it gets on and she’s trained to know a good vs a bad client and we respond right away. Either she’s calling to set up a consult or I’m calling to begin the consult and get them into the firm. The only time I’ve ever missed out on a client I was on vacation and my receptionist’s phone died. With there being a limited number of attorneys in each group this is unlike any other lead service, and I’ve used a lot of them.

> Okay so I’ve read the responses posted by other attorneys who have had “bad experiences” with legalmatch and I would like to share my story.

I’m a criminal defense attorney who wanted to take on personal injury clients as well. I had been practicing 17 years when I did the legalmatch lead demo and I saw the value. We looked at criminal defense clients and a few PI clients when it came time for pricing the PI membership was way out of my budget not having PI victories to pad my bank account. I decided to start with a 2 year membership even though I was worried there was no opt out but I was offered a money back guarantee that put my mind at ease, at the very least I knew I would be able to litigate my way out of that 1 page contract in my sleep if I really needed to.

Within the first year I spent almost 18k on my monthly membership fees and brought in almost 150k in retainers alone this is not including when the retainer was exhausted and additional funds were brought in. I charged 4k retainers to every client, dwi to assault. I will admit some of the clients didn’t have the money to pay the retainer and as easily as I got in contact with them I never was in contact with them again.

6 months before my membership was going to end I had a conversation with my key account person.

> things moving with minimal disruption. One of the biggest pros I’ve seen is flexibility—you can scale hours up or down based on need, and you’re not adding full-time overhead. It’s also useful if you want coverage for things like call handling or intake without pulling your in-office assistant away from case support.

Downside? It can take time to find the *right* VA who understands legal context, and you’ll likely spend a bit more time upfront building process documentation if they’re remote. But once it clicks, it can really ease the load.

Curious if you’re leaning more toward a receptionist-style VA or someone who can also handle backend admin tasks like file management or calendaring?

> If your recruiter can get the firm to agree to the arrangement that you'll take the receptionist job but on the condition that it will only be temporary (and make sure they agree to a set amount of months) and then they'll give you the project assistant role, that's great and you should take it.  Paralegal certificates really don't mean much in the legal world, it is actual hands-on practice experience that is valuable.  You need to get some real legal work experience on your resume and working as a "project assistant" or "legal assistant" is how you start off doing that.  So if the firm will agree to what your recruiter is proposing, that's a good way in.

Option B definitely gives walk-in clients but we also need to watch the door which is truly a huge fucking hassle. If you’re family law you will have all the clients you need and then some. I’d recommend option A until you can afford the higher rent and a receptionist to cover the door.

> not a brag but i do some PI. have a firm that keeps about 20-25 cases. they’re all catastrophic or at least a crazy story, and they’re usually pretty interesting because of the science or story behind it. some products, some employment, even a few auto cases (you’ll always have at least a few even if it’s friends or friends of friends and you’d otherwise pass on it), some business. basically, if i think i can litigate it and make decent money, i’ll do it. i do get brought into trials too, i guess. otherwise this sounds super easy. these cases are discovery intensive, though.

  
anyway. my point with all of this is that there *is* interesting plaintiffs’ work out there if that’s your thing. you just aren’t being exposed to it. i’d pick up all the skills you can in the time you remain at your current job and start polishing off your resume while you look for a boutique type place. you still need at least some of the skills you’re learning now, even if it’s organization, filing, calendaring. 

equally important is to see what these people are doing wrong, and avoid it. do they take too many of certain cases? if their goal is prelit settlement but they find the left turn cases never settle, they should immediately refer them to someone who will file them, right? do they borrow too much? at bad rates? are their computers too old/expensive? do they pay too much for software they never use? is the receptionist fucking stoned and missing calls?

good luck. there are a lot of areas of practice even in P law. what you’re doing now barely requires a law license. it’ll get better when you bounce.

> Thanks for the reply, few things. 

Based off of things I’ve read, it seems like law school admissions office might like to see someone (especially a KJD) have some experience in a law firm. Maybe this is incorrect, but I am exploring because I’d like to strengthen my application. 

The LOR may not help much like you said. However, I’m in a position where I need people that would be willing to write a LOR for me that know me well, or worked closely. I have a few managers from my current company that would write good LOR’s, but perhaps since it’s in an entirely different field (fitness) it may not carry much weight. Academic LOR’s are going to be difficult because I’m mostly online at this point due to balancing school, work, and LSAT. My professors don’t know me personally.

As I am young, my time is certainly my best asset. In this situation, unfortunately it’s not. However, I would be with the firm much longer than 5 months. If I apply this fall for law school, I would not be going to law school until the following year. This gives me potentially over a year of time, and I’d transition to working full-time after I graduate from undergrad / finish apps in the fall. So there is close to 9 months at least there of full-time work.

There’s also the chance that I don’t get the score I want / don’t get into the school I want, and I decide to re-apply the following cycle. 

Given this, would an attorney like you consider me for a paralegal assistant role? Receptionist? I’m charismatic, provide great customer service, eager to learn, and disciplined. Once again, I’m just not sure what roles would even be available for me. I know I’m unqualified for paralegal work as of now.

> Once you start getting more calls than you can handle yourself you would want to look into getting a receptionist. The problem with hiring in office receptionist is you have sick days, people quitting, hiring and training costs etc. plus you have the issue of after hour calls needing to be answered.

So you really want to put a focus on call answering once you get to that point because that will boost your profitability. A lot of firms lose money simply because they lost new potential clients which can be as simple missing incoming calls.

> You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. 

Since your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.

> Absolutely! A remote law firm is not only possible but becoming more common, especially with the right systems in place. Since you're licensed in multiple jurisdictions, you already have a big advantage—you can serve clients across different regions without needing a physical office.

The biggest challenges tend to be client communication, call management, and maintaining a professional presence. Some solo and small firm attorneys use a mix of AI and live receptionists to handle inbound/outbound calls, chat, and SMS, so they don’t miss potential clients while staying focused on casework. There are even services that provide 24/7 coverage with U.S.-based receptionists who can screen leads, schedule appointments, and follow up—without locking you into long-term contracts.

Curious—what kind of practice are you looking to build? Estate planning, business law, something else?

> I left the public defenders office to join a family law firm and started a criminal defense practice for that family law firm. I later left that firm and joined a larger firm and continued to do criminal defense and family law. I made most of my money from family law, but enjoyed the criminal law practice 1000% more. For years I tried to ditch family law and do more criminal defense work. I was not successful. Partly because I kept taking on big complex family law cases, but partly because I was known as a family law lawyer and that's what people referred my way. 

  
Family law burned me out. I was only able to fully quit it by moving to another jurisdiction and joining a firm doing completely different work. 

  
My family law clients were very needy. They require a lot of staff support. My criminal defense clients were usually not very needy and I barely needed staff to handle them. (Don't get me wrong staff was important, but it was possible to handle my criminal law files without staff if necessary. Family law without staff may be possible for stronger lawyers than I, but I don't recommend it.) 

  
From a financial standpoint, your plan makes sense. From a mental health stand point, I strongly recommend against it. If you expand to family law, you will need a good receptionist and a good paralegal. Someone that can calm the clients down when you aren't available, and someone to work up the files for you while you are in court.  

  
I found that learning family law was not that difficult. That was true in my jurisdiction partly because the judges largely ignored the rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, caselaw, etc. Family law was where the rules meant nothing. The "trials" were not enjoyable like criminal trials. No jury. Usually just the other side, maybe a couple of other small witnesses. Your trial advocacy skills won't get used much. 

  
The hardest part to learn, beyond dealing with the clients, was calculating child support and alimony/maintenance/spousal support. That and learning how to read a tax return. Befriend a CPA and pay them to help you understand a tax return if that isn't something you are familiar with. 

  
But ultimately, don't do it. If you can make a decent living doing criminal defense, you'll be a lot happier.

> It sounds like you don't have anything lined up in the US. So why "quit" as opposed to just telling them you cannot work during that period? 

I would tell them that you really enjoy working there, that you are getting married and moving to the US and will be unable to work due to visa restrictions from \[date\] to \[date\], and that you'd like to resume working for them after that period ends, and ask them if they would be okay with that. You can always quit later if/when you find a different job.

As far as how much notice to give them, that depends on a number of factors. 

If you have a contract with them, that could require you to give a certain amount. 

How much will your absence affect them and how easily could you be replaced? 

For example, say you are 1 of 2 receptionists, you could probably be replaced relatively quickly and the other receptionist could cover in the meantime. In that situation, 2 weeks' notice would be more than adequate. On the other hand, the last time I left a firm, I ended up giving a month's notice because there would have been real problems if I left two weeks before certain hearings were about to start. As long as 2-weeks' notice wouldn't create real problems for them, they shouldn't be upset with 2 weeks.

How important is this income to you? 

It's always possible that if you tell them you're leaving, they'll fire you. Depending on how badly you need the income, you may not want to risk that.

I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. 

2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. 

3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from "service" to "litigation" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. 

4. Expansion: You're a new solo, but if you want to bring on staff or other attorneys in the future, having a CMS prevents things like accidentally deleting a line in the excel sheet, usually gives essentially version control to most stuff in the file, and allows you to set standard processes that let you train staff, make sure they're doing their work, assign tasks and grow responsibly. But in order to do that, it's so much easier to set up the processes before you have them and it's just you. build a foundation with an eye towards expansion so you're not trying to create processes and adjust to the new CMS when you've got two paralegals and a receptionist.

> Is it court appearances the reason you want an associate?  I ask because I worked for a solo for over 20 years.  After about 5 years, the firm had grown, and I started taking over some of the lighter firm administrative duties, in addition to my lead litigation role.  We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.  My solo did securities litigation and arbitration (me), some personal injury, and elder law.  All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.

My boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.

This allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.

By the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.  We had such a great group of staff working there, so staff issues were minimal.

He also purchased a business condo, which turned out to be a wonderful firm investment. One securities case award was enough to pay it off and then served as an open line of credit if it was needed between awards/settlements.

He still calls me on occasion for advice.  He has his eye on winding down his practice, refers complex litigation to younger attorneys in other firms, and has built a great elder law practice, which keeps him quite comfortable.   He still has the same elder law paralegal.

Make sure you have access to conditional call forwarding so that you can hire a receptionist or call answering service if you need one!

> I'm currently on year 8 of running a three-attorney (including me) firm in a small rural market. Here is what you need to make this work.

1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.
2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.
3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.
4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.

> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.

Part of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.

> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.

Is that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.

> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?

Yes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). 

Now - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.

CAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.

That sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. 

> When did you decide to add an associate?

When we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).

> Do you build a big cash cushion first?

Yes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.

> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....

Agreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps a bit thankless, work. Check out appellate public defense work. I might be doing that if I wasn't doing this and had no loans. Last contract

> I use my case
I’ve never even heard of the program that you use, but I’m going to check it out. I’m happy with mycase, but it can’t hurt to see what you’re using. 

I think you’re in estate planning. If so, you should reach out to divorce lawyers in the area that you service. Explain to them that once their clients are divorced they’ll need a new estate plan. (obviously you have to focus on the divorce lawyers that service the middle-class and upper class.) offer them a referral fee. I imagine you’ll get a fair amount of work.

I’m curious as to why you need Lexis. I’m not throwing any shade. I mean it’s an honest question. Estate planning law changes slowly. I run a family law firm 82.7% of our time is spent on Paternity, Divorce, and family law post judgment order modification. The rest is spent doing estate planning for our middle and upper class clients post judgment. 

I read what used to be called the advanced sheets— that is the appellate cases and state Supreme Court cases relevant to family law as they come out. They are free and I’m sure they’re free in your state too. On September 1, 2024 my state, California, modified the algebra equation we use to calculate child support. Legal news reported it six months before it happened so no surprises for us.

Depending on how much you’re earning the 350 you’re gonna be paying for Lexus could be significant and might be a cost you can do without

I found that if you focus on a certain area such as estate planning or family law, the amount of new laws very modest and as a result, Alexis or West law subscription is unnecessary  (using fastlaw) to ensure any cases you cite are up-to-date (ie Shepardize the cases).

I’m very interested in your virtual legal assistant. And I’d love it if you had the time too expand on that either on this post or DM. I have four experience, legal assistance and office manager one real receptionist +4 virtual receptionists that we pay for as an expense words I don’t give them 1099s. 

I love my virtual receptionists. I’ve made an effort to get to know them and to be interested in them at least superficially and they really do a great job for us. The way we have it set up. Is potential clients go to me or to the office manager. and we can switch that up on the fly. My unique sales proposition is that I have a lot of litigation experience,  so I’m in court three days out of five. But I don’t always have to spend the entire day there. Plus our court takes a lunch break from 12 to 130 during which I spent a portion of my time prepping the parties and witnesses for the second half of the day and a portion of my time returning calls.

I think it’s important that the owner of the firm takes client calls often.   I’m personable. I speak plainly and I am the person who is best able to judge whether the client is a good fit.

> “Outsourcing” is a vague term. That’s why this question can’t be answered. 

Potential meanings of outsourcing:

* what you said, giving work to firm B when you have too much work
* hiring temporary attorneys to do legal work. There are agencies out there where you can farm out drafting and other types of legal work
* using temporary workers to do non-legal work. For example, a single attorney probably doesn’t need a permanent bookkeeper. But he could probably use 5-10 hours of bookkeeping work per month. As another example, hiring a receptionist can be costly. Hiring a provider to answer your phone can be much cheaper and be 24/7.

A word of caution, as a non-attorney who has dealt with lots of other non-attorneys: be careful of the support staffers who are super confident about their approach and make big claims about their abilities. It might seem comforting to have someone like that on your team (heck, they might really BE that good), but they will respect you and your work less than someone less experienced who asks questions, listens to your answers, and strives do things the way you want for your practice. 

Have you considered a virtual receptionist or something explicitly noncommittal, even if just to try out your delegating skills and see how it feels to manage someone else on your cases?  It may give you some additional insights as to what you really need from a permanent assistant.

You were involved with litigation, right? Perhaps there’s some opposing firms you liked working with and could see yourself moving to. Chat them up and see if there’s opportunities for you. This isn’t the only game in town. Even if things aren’t bad, you still progressed from receptionist to paralegal and your skill set has grown. It’s perfectly normal for folks to find a new job to continue growing their career a year or so after a promotion.

-Regarding the device security, I’d suggest to them they need to give you a device owned by the firm. 

Also, don’t install any MDM stuff because they will erase everything on your laptop/phone if and when they fold the firm or you leave- regardless of whether it’s your or their device. Also, you probably don’t want to have the liability of keeping your device secure “enough”.

If they can’t afford a MacBook M2 Air or a $1k Costco laptop it’s a pretty good signal they really are out of money. They may be looking for ways to control access to client files very soon.

I get a nice big kitchen area with appliances and up to 2 hours per day in a meeting room also included.  It also has all the necessary office machines in case mine ever goes down.  There is a much larger nicer meeting room with all the trimmings but that you have to pay for.  Reasonable rate.  Perfect for me because the free room is quite large.  Would only need the bigger room in the case of a full deposition that would go longer than two hours.  

But they also have flexibility.  If you need more soace they have bigger offices so you would be moving next door not across town.  Or you can add on smaller offices or release some you already have to downsize.  You can also use their facilities anywhere.  So I can pop in and use a meeting room in the next county if need be.  They are all over the place.

For demand generation, it’s mostly just me using ChatGPT to get a solid draft going We’ve got a full-time receptionist, but during after-hours or when she’s already on a call, I use Lawtte to handle overflow. I would probably say the real key is hiring someone who is tech savvy.

> Virtual receptionists can be a great solution for solo and small firms — they offer 24/7 coverage, reduce missed calls, and project a professional image. Just make sure they’re trained on your intake process and legal tone. Downside: they may lack the nuance of in-house staff, so complex client questions might still fall to you. Best setup is using them for first contact, scheduling, and routing — keeps you focused on billable work.

> We have used Ruby as a reception service since we opened 14 years ago. It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately. (We also only conduct busines calls and emails during work hours except if it's a emergency.)

> As someone who was at a small firm way longer than I should have been, the equal bonus amongst staff was always leaving me on a sour note. As the highest biller (sometimes bringing in more than senior attorneys) and getting the same bonus as the file clerk and receptionist - it made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. It also felt horrible when law clerks and associates would get sometimes a bonus that equaled a partner share - when a lot of their billable hours were written off and mine was always charged. Not to mention - no raises. 

I always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. 

When a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. 

Remember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. 

Just my thoughts!

> Not a lawyer, but I’ve used them a bunch over the years, both personally and for our businesses.

In 2018 I was sued over lease hold agreement. This was the landlord for commercial building that my business was renting and leased for several years. He was suing us because he changed the terms of the lease about two years into attend your lease he did not ask he did not offer: he demanded and proclaimed that they were changing and we had no choice.  

The attorney I was using at that time was in her third year with a local firm. At one point about two months after the first service, something happened at the Law Firm and the next time I called to talk to her the receptionist or secretary sent me to a different attorney who told me that he was taking over the case because she was no longer with that firm. I asked him if her departure had anything to do with any of our current work, to which he replied no. 

Once we started talking about the next response, it was obvious that not only had he not read the case file, he incorrectly summarized what he had read, and wasn’t at all interested in listening. 

Once I hung up with him, I called my former attorneys cell phone, and asked her how she th was doing. We spoke for about 10 minutes, and at that time, she was very adroit at never even implying or allowing inference through omission that there was anything untoward at her former firm.

Before the call, I told her that I wasn’t entirely certain about my comfort with the new council, but I wasn’t sure about the ethics, and politics,… We are a rather small town… surrounding whether she might be able to take up my case again. 

That night, one of our friends who has a relative who works at the old Law Firm said that not only was our attorney gone, but one of the senior partners was gone, and there had been a  settlement with my attorney having to do with something “not right” happening between the senior partner and her. 

TLDR: IANAL but I will definitely follow any attorney I’m working with -who I trust - if they leave a firm while they’re working on one of my cases.  

Preempt: I’ve never initiated a lawsuit, although I have counter-sued. most of the words that I have for attorneys is contractual and or mineral rights associated.

> **Answering Your Question:**

Be optimisic. It's hard to tell over text, but I feel like the tone you're asking the question in is a frustrated one. High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.

Some of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:

* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.
* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.
* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level. This is normal and required an atitidue adjustment on my part to get the most out of my internship. Understand you're not being treated poorly, the things they're trying to teach you are likely just very different from anything you've ever worked with.

I'd also like to clarify that the I began work for the firm I am with now while I was in high school, so I understand your position. In my direct experience, you have to get your foot in the door doing absolute grunt work and then go from there. Through an ICE program, I was the morning receptionist at out main location for about 6 months until they could hire someone full-time. It wasn't until that point that I was given a position I actually enjoyed. 

Now a year later, I'm about to start college and the dynamic I have with the firm is beggining to change. It just takes time.



**Some general advice for starting a career before you have an undergrad degree:**

Once you have your foot in the door, set yourself apart. I took tons of side-projects while also doing reception work, typically on the bussiness management side, and our managing partner started to lean on me to deal with some of the administrative things he didn't enjoy. 

With resumes, I also recommend you follow the guides listed by top universities. I did tons of unpaid work on political campaigns before this position, which wasn't fun but beefed up my resume and gave me real-world experience. When creating my resume, I based it off the placement office resources at Indiana University, Harvard University, and MIT. Your resume should absolutely be a single page. I'd be happy to send you mine if you do want a reference. Timing is also important. Push your resume to as many firms as you can.

> Not trying to be a jerk, but I would dissuade you from this course of action. The fact that you “love to argue about the law” and are interested in crime and politics are really not good reasons to go spend three+ years and a bunch of money only to get spit out low on the totem pole into a grueling and largely unfulfilling profession where you have like a 10% chance at finding something that even somewhat resembles your expectation of what lawyers do.

If you are serious about this, and this is a thoroughly well thought out plan where you understand the cost/benefit, I would make SURE you shadow some attorneys first. Not the glamorous side of the job, but actually try to see under the hood. Maybe even take a part time gig as a receptionist or assistant at a small law firm for a few months on your non-nursing days. I think you will be surprised at what you find.

> Slightly different opinion than most.  If you want to go LLM route, work part time as a clerical for a small firm while you're doing it.  My receptionist had a degree from Poland and she was by far overqualified and the best admin I've ever had.  When she wanted to go back to school for her LLM so she could practice law, I suggested she work part time for me because I didn't want to lose her.  I then offered her a first year position, and she's coming back in September after she sits for the bar.  If you show your skills and intelligence while getting the degree, a pathway to a job may be easier.  But I am a small office of 2.  I bet 8 years into your career though most employers wont care that much if you have an LLM or a JD if you're looking for a new position with experience.

> TL;DR: You can go solo and there are TONS of ways to do so! 

  
Meh. It depends. You can work up to an easy solo "Ronin" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  

You can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do "DSS Defense" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).

The worst part (for me) is the "running a business" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a "brick and mortar" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that "Gen-X Joke" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  


The #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  


14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)

When the receptionist takes a day off I have to cover, if she goes on vacation I have to cover, a sick day etc etc. so it’s fine when she’s here but when she takes any time off which is fine, it’s not her fault, I have to do it. 

The partners don’t really involve themself in this, it’s the admin and office managers who decides what goes and they don’t want to sit here obviously so they tell me to 

But I’m expected to do the same level of work .. always.

I would help with very basic clerical tasks, sometimes cover for the assistants/receptionist as needed. If you're at a small firm, it's common to have a all-hands on deck mentality imo.

Is the receptionist out quite often or is this just on an as-needed basis? Also, are the partners understanding that your work for them might be a little slower on days you cover for the receptionist? Or are they being unreasonable?

> Hello there! Glad you reached out!

As I am not in the UK, I can't exactly speak on their terms of employment requirements. Also, I am not in a position to comment on qualifications without knowing your work history or education. I personally took a short administration course through a local college to get a certificate before I got my first reception job in a law firm. This course was just a basic admin course not specified for law, but it was enough to get my foot in the door.

My first office was a small, slow firm, 4 lawyers, 2 paralegals.   This helped me learn at a slower pace and it truly helped me along the way. I always recommend trying to get into a small firm for those who are wanting to get into a law admin position.

Maybe in your resume and/or cover letter, point out the skills you have that would benefit the role of a receptionist. Can you answer the phone with proper etiquette? Do you have any previous work experience where you had to deal with confidential information or emotionally charged clientele? Can you respond to emails in a timely and professional manner? How organized are you? Do you have customer-service experience? These are all super basic, but majorly important skills to have as a receptionist. 

Getting yourself into a position like a law receptionist or admin is a fantastic way to get in and see if this career is right for you without spending the time, money, and effort into going to law school. If you find yourself an opportunity to work in a law firm, really take everything in. Ask questions to better your knowledge. Read through documents during any down time. Help out fellow co-workers and lawyers. Join law admin groups on Facebook or Reddit as well for tips and tricks.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions. I'm always here to help!

I've heard of small plaintiff's firms that landed a huge verdict doling out BIG bonuses to everyone - not just associates.  If you work in a firm with three attorneys and five staffers and the firm gets (for example) a $5 million fee, I could totally see them giving the five staffers $25K+ bonuses.  That's a drop in the bucket with a fee that big, but it could be life-changing for a receptionist making $50K per year.

If it's not a closed door, it's pretty normal for someone to interrupt (regardless of "rank") with a quick question/update. I'm surprised the seniors haven't reacted already if she's out of line.

What is your firm's work flow? Are these things you also work on? Where are the files located? If she knows where to grab the file, maybe she thinks she's supposed to just get it.

I really don't get this unless you're the receptionist for the managing partner who likes to play Japanese CEO. Totally normal.

> Your age is not an issue.  Your GPA will be an issue for getting into a law school, but you're probably already knocked out of consideration of the higher ranked schools (I had a 2.7 coming out of college and was in the lowest quarter of my entering class).

I generally try to dissuade people from going to law school mainly because the price tag isn't worth it.  Most people coming out of law school are not going to have jobs that earn enough money to live and pay back the monstrous loans.  Those that are capable of paying their loans take on extremely soul-sucking jobs to do so.  

The apprenticing model in California requires you to work in a lawyer's office.  If you're interested at all, I would try to find a non-attorney job (like a paralegal or investigator) to get into an office and show you what the industry is like.  My first job out of college was as a receptionist for a small law firm in Boston.  I did go on to law school, but never landed a "real" law job afterwards and now I do compliance for the Federal Government.

> I'm an associate in a small firm (7 attorneys) that deals exclusively with family law. The four "senior" attorneys each have their own paralegals, whom they each pay individually, while us three junior attorneys do not have any support staff. Our receptionist completes basic tasks for everyone in the firm, like taking phone messages and putting postage on envelopes, but other than that we're each on our own. 

I actually pay one of the senior attorney's paralegals on the side (with permission) to draft stuff for me as needed. I'm in an awkward position where I'm not bringing in enough to hire my own full-time assistant yet, but I'm getting more work than what I can manage on my own. This arrangement works for now. But do I wish that our firm had legal assistants that were available to everyone? Yes. 

I'd like to hear from others how common this arrangement is, though. My friend is an associate at a medium-sized firm and thinks it's outrageous that I pay out of pocket for an assistant. He says that's something the firm ought to cover for associates, like Lexis and Clio (both of which I also pay out of pocket for). Everyone at my firm acts like it's totally normal, though, so I really don't know if this is the "done" thing?

1. Vonage Business integrates directly with Clio to the point that a phone call auto logs into the billing entry and adds the contact if they are in there. Really convenient for auto billing every phone call. 

2. Don’t know. We use old school receptionist

3. We use Google workplace as our main server and email, Microsoft office suite, quick books. Also, give faster suite a try. It’s a really neat Clio integration. It’s a little pricey but works well. Zoom integration works. Zapier is great for automation. 

4. Don’t know, don’t use Clios trust account. 

5. Google loves organic content. Make sure you have your local Google maps set up, write good blog posts to generate valuable content, have clients leave Google reviews.

Its also prepared me to handle emergency situations where people are sick and things needs to be done right.

> This is a very common challenge for small or solo law practices. Between court appearances, client meetings, and after-hours emergencies, it’s easy for calls to pile up. And most clients don’t appreciate waiting.

Some approaches we see working well: Using Virtual receptionists (especially ones trained in legal protocols) to answer and triage calls during gaps or after hours, Scheduled call forwarding for known court days or off-hours, Automated appointment booking + call-back systems for non-urgent inquiries.

Full disclosure: at AnswerConnect, we work with law firms to provide live, professional call coverage so lawyers can focus on billable work and urgent matters aren’t missed. Many small practices use this as a supplement to in-house staff rather than a replacement.

Happy to share tips on what tends to work best in real-world practice without overcomplicating workflows.

> Well, one of the advantages of dealing with clients at weekends is that you can raise the price. For example, if you have an ice cream shop, instead of closing it at night, keep it open at night but raise the prices because of the timing. So it's better if you deal with clients on weekends.

Even if you can't, you can integrate AI to deal with clients using AI tools such as AI Front Desk.

### r/agency — 2025-02-14 | 2pts | `pricing`

> This is tricky but I can share some industry standards.

For my clients I recommend considering 70% “at capacity“ If you have fewer than ten employees. (Contractors don’t count because they aren’t fixed costs). 

That’s about 30 hours a week per billable employee. 

This is not just to allow work that isn‘t billable, it’s to put some slack in your schedule to better respond to clients and opportunities. its hard to respond if you are at 100% utilization. 

Now not all employees are billable. For example, a receptionist or bookkeeper, CFO, etc. 

That gives you your rough ceiling. If the founder only spends half their time on billable work, you account for that (15 hrs a week). 

So 6 hours a day for production people is “at capacity” 4.85 is low. 

Another issue is timekeeping. Time keeping will always lag behind ACTUAL TIME spent on billable work because people forget to enter time for small things - multiply that five minute email here and that 15 min internal client discussion X ten people = a lot of “lost” time. 

You are over staffed. One of the biggest and most expensive mistakes I made was not cutting staff fast enough. We would work on elaborate internal projects - great work but bad practice. 

Drive more billable hours or cut 1-2 people.

On the call screening topic, two things come to mind:

1. Google Voice (Free)
It prompts the caller to “state your name and Google Voice will try to connect you.” You can keep that feature on or off, but it helps filter unknown numbers. Sure, people can game it by just saying their name, but tone usually gives them away.

2. Virtual receptionist (Paid)
If you’re getting a ton of calls, there are services that answer for you and follow a script. They’ll email you something like:
	•	Name: John Doe
	•	Reason for call: [explanation]
	•	Seeking representation: Yes/No
	•	Call back: [number]

I’ve been exploring AI receptionists to help handle incoming calls and reduce missed opportunities for my small insurance office. Most of my callers hang up without leaving a voicemail, and it’s been a recurring issue during busy hours. 

I recently started using Sonant AI and it’s been a game changer. It answers instantly 24/7, and handles basic stuff like intake questions and appointment requests without missing a beat. And it sounds real and most people have no idea that it’s AI. It also integrates easily with the systems I already use which is just great.

That said, there are a ton of options out there like Smith AI, Dialzara, etc. but their pricing and features are all over the place. Has anyone done a deep dive or tested multiple tools? Curious what’s actually worked well for others in practice.

> Yo just saw this thread. DO NOT AND LET ME REPEAT DO NOT Listen to anyone who says "creating a new account" is the way to fix local services ads. This is a severely misguided suggestion from people who do not understand how LSA works. When LSA performance tanks its generally because Google has stopped serving LSA as much. Google has to walk a delicate balance with LSA while also keeping law firms who only run PPC ads getting leads. This is often the case when performance drops. LSA is a black box and Google can and does do whatever they want with it. This often means that sometimes performance will be WAYYY up, sometime performace will be way down. Then other times you will suddenly get off topic and out of geo leads. This is when they are testing keyword and geo expansions behind the scenes. The REAL answer to fix LSA is to also be running PPC and run these account in unison to reach your monthly goal. We break LSA accounts out from PPC account in our MCC so that we can see the fluctuations happening in real and make adjustments to budgets between platforms. This is how the pro's do it, because you cant entirely trust a black box and you DEFINTELY should not trust anyone who says "Making a new account will fix it" this is just PURE NONSENSE!!!!!

> Building a lead generation powerhouse for a law firm requires a strategic approach that combines digital marketing, content creation, relationship building, and data-driven optimization. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a system that consistently generates high-quality leads for your law firm:

---

### **1. Define Your Target Audience**
- **Identify Your Niche:** Focus on specific practice areas (e.g., personal injury, family law, corporate law, etc.).
- **Create Client Personas:** Understand your ideal clients’ demographics, pain points, and motivations.

---

### **2. Build a High-Converting Website**
- **Mobile-Friendly Design:** Ensure your website is responsive and loads quickly.
- **Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs):** Use compelling CTAs like “Schedule a Free Consultation” or “Get a Case Evaluation.”
- **Landing Pages:** Create dedicated landing pages for each practice area or service.
- **Trust Signals:** Display client testimonials, case results, awards, and certifications.
- **Contact Forms:** Keep forms simple and easy to fill out.

- **Content Marketing:** Publish blog posts, FAQs, and guides that address common legal questions.
- **Backlinks:** Build high-quality backlinks from reputable websites to improve domain authority.

---

### **4. Leverage Paid Advertising (PPC)**

- **Retargeting:** Use retargeting ads to re-engage visitors who didn’t convert.
- **Social Media Ads:** Run ads on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram to reach your target audience.
- **Budget Management:** Monitor ad spend and optimize campaigns for ROI.

---

### **5. Build a Strong Social Media Presence**

Leaving that aside, I think you are really misunderstanding how lead generation and client interaction work for lawyers, particularly in the world of contracts. We run a lot of risk whenever giving legal advice, and even more if we endorse legal representations we haven't even reviewed. 

By the time something like this is tuned for ethical compliance it's less of a lead generation tool than an answering service, but now with pages of disclaimers preceding it.

Generative AI is revolutionizing legal practice, but it's absolutely not ready to be client-facing yet, let alone facing prospective clients.

The replies from your Axacore vendor don't seem very helpful and don't explain the high rate of failure.

I'd maybe look at other companies that offer online fax service in your area, 50% of faxes failing is a huge issue. There's also a handful of large online fax providers that you could use (there's a monthly requests thread if you want more info that you could ask there)

In the mean time, I'd be hammering the Dialog support to get answers on why you're having so many issues. You could use HP's Fax Service to send some test faxes to 1-888-HPFaxme (1-888-473-2963 U.S.) and see what happens. If it fails, contact the support and ask them why, and keep testing and pushing them until they fix it or you can find an alternative. I know this would be super frustrating to me if I couldn't get a solution when something is failing 50% of the time, and since you're sending medical faxes it's even more important they get sent timely.

> cell providers are (at least Verizon and AT&T)  flagging tons of businesses as spam that are not. 

You say you have a verizon MVNO, even if you replicated the issue you are out of luck.  They will not, cannot,  help you.  

You need a test line with one or all of the big 3 that is having the issue.  NVNO do not have the ability to escalate tickets to people who can help.  That is the point of the NVNO, that is why they are cheap.

Threaten your provider with moving to a different carrier. 

If they can't help, then look at the cost to move to a big carrier.  

Verizon business isn't absolutely awful, not fantastic, and customers get lost in the shuffle, and maybe don't get the best support on issues.  

Get a sales quote from a couple providers.  Take that to your provider.  Tell them to fix it or you are going to cancel.

Your provider may do some poor practices, like not validate calling numbers against their customers accounts, thus allowing a customer to outpulse any number they want.  This is a big no no.  They might have a large number of customers with auto dialers.  Could be lots of things.  It could be the big companies are using stir shaken as an excuse to screw over small low cost providers by rating their trust as low and flagging calls as spam.

Track all the issues you have, emails, and support calls to your provider.  If you are under contract you will need maybe six or so attempts at working with your provider documented to get out of paying ETF for breaking any contracts you are under.  Contracts can always be broken, you just need examples of how the provider is not providing a quality service.  It doesn't matter that caller id is not guaranteed or that service quality is not in the contract.  Any provider giving bad service will let you out of a contract rather than deal with government fines.

If you really want to keep your provider then file a complaint with your states utility commission.  Every state has one or more departments that take resident complaints about utilities.  And these departments have POWER.  Providers mess with them and suddenly no permits for doing any work on poles, no permits for expansions. 

If you have documented tickets and they want to charge ETF, a report to the FTC will clear that up immediately.  You need good documented tickets.  You need to work with your provider in good faith. If they call you back, answer the calls.  If they want test calls then you make them.  Filing a complaint is not a free service/pay no fees card.

You can complain to the FCC's consumer complaint.  Last I knew these were slower to get worked due to the volume of reports they get.  I know some really nice helpful people at the FCC, but waiting weeks for your ticket to reach the top of the que sucks.

Still waiting for a good answer on this in terms of something that works with the PSTN and isn't some expensive per-seat commercial solution (like zoom phone or ringcentral).

in my tests 3CX client with opus was certainly better than , "some random SIP client", but still probably not as good as other solutions.

I did jitsi test with someone who had a bad 4G connection and it was able to do better than even whatsapp/FB calling, so there are different tiers and incremental improvements to Forward error correction being made over time that \*some\* companies implement, although they are controversial and not often default. Opus 1.5 was released for example with something they call "deep redundancy" which should maintain call quality even with massive packet loss, but it is not implemented yet by anything iirc.

personally I find it sad that there isn't some easily solution , I went down a rabbit hole of WEBRTC clients that connect to some PBXs , supposedly that's a half-decent solution. Still , many of the apps seem to be at a "hobbyist" level of maturity.

At some point I want to test out these "WebRTC" bridges that claim to allow you to connect a smartphone to the PBX and then the PBX handles the SIP outside of the first leg (thus your phone is not subject to packet loss errors or WAN connection changes, and benefits from FEC & other features)

rant:  
It's unfortunate I sometimes get made of by network admins on reddit or IRC for not using the right language or acronyms when discussing this stuff. They get very defensive "you don't understand what SIP is, etc" and we get into a semantic discussions or questioning my skillset rather than an honest  discussion of the status quo , potential hacks, and new innovations coming down the pipe

> I HAD THE FUCKING SAME THING HAPPEN. THEY GOT ME TO UPGRADE THEN SLAPPED ME WITH AN ERROR 22300 THEN STARTED PRESSING ME FOR MAD PERSONAL DETAILS LIKE I'M A FUCKING CRIMINAL. THIS IS INSANE AND I WANT TO REMIND EVERYTHING THAT TWILIO GETS BREACHED AND LEAKS YOUR DATA CONSTANTLY... they want MORE data from you that they don't even plan to fucking safeguard... and they think WE ARE the fraud?!... And since the Twilio sub likely won't let me critical post through... I'll post it the fuck here:

I've heard from a friend in Big Tech and now I'm experiencing it... "they're dicey", this pm told me.

I'm writing a fairly simple aliasing extension and wanted people to have a cheaper alternative to Burner for phone aliasing. I do three tests and then get a message that I MUST upgrade. As soon as I do that... Twilio slaps me with an error that I'm not allowed to create numbers anymore with an error 22300 "This account is restricted from provisioning new long code phone numbers". Literally that same instant, there wasn't even a semblance of service rendered.

I find out I have to email some verify@ email to get this block lifted, so I do that explaining my case, as requested in their link: This account is restricted from provisioning new long code phone numbers. I get an email today that they think I'm fraud, asking for everything from website addresses to several details about my credit card. Fucking EXCUSE ME?! In the original email I wrote to verify@ (which clearly they didn't even read), most of those questions were answered.

There was NO MENTION of the refund I requested in that original email i wrote to them either. I just did the closing process but based on the fact these guys are saying I'm a fraud since my username differs from my legal name (and they'll probably lose their absolute minds when they find out I have a preferred name at work), I'm guessing I won't even receive my refund they claim they return after closing... So I'm ready to call my credit company and they can find out then just how fucking real my payment details are.

I plan to tell every Tom, Dick, and Harry developer I meet to stay tf away the same way my big tech buddy tried to warn me. I'm damn sure there are alternatives and I'm going with that; the only reason I went with Twilio is cos the AI agents all said it was the best way... their competitors simply need better AI-SEO. Anyone brings this company up to me, I'll be like "well, if you enjoy paying someone to be called a con artist without any fucking basis other than your username and legal name are entirely different... like regular people oft do... then this is not the place for you."

> Not sure if this is the right avenue for this, but I am looking to know if such a service exists. Like 15 years I go I built a tool in PHP. The tool allows me to generate test calls (100s of them if needed) for the projects I am working on. This helps me to validate that we can handle the calls we believe we should be able to handle. 

In the last few years I ported this tool over to Python and added the ability to call a range of phone numbers and give you a status of what actually answered and to transcribe calls in order to validate what callers hear matches what you expected. My tool has only ever ran from my local computer and I am debating putting it online if something like it already exists. I am looking for something that is easy to work with and pretty much pay as you go that has these capabilities. Anyone know of one?

To recap I am looking for:
* Ability to place a consistent number of calls to a specific number. (Load testing)
* Ability to put in a range of phone numbers and provide a report of the outcome of those calls. Fax, no answer, error, human, etc.
* Ability to navigate an IVR and transcribe what is being heard.

Thanks.

PS: I know about Empirix/Hammer and the like, but those seem like more enterprise agreement tools and I am looking for something more consumer focused.

As part of my thesis I had to create custom bot from our llm. Its able to take customer voice as input, and return answer that shoud be played back to him. My problem is that for now all the testing was done only using one pc and microphone, but as next step we want to implement call via voip. So customer can call the number and than speak with our bot.

And for last 3 weeks I coud not find sollution that woud work for me. Basicaly i need voip service that can expose audiostream of one side to our server and then use output of server as answer for customer.

Is there any (simple, and possibly free)  solution for me or is it not possible? Any help will be appreciated.

> OK, update. I did submit a ticket, and then had a lengthy chat with them via IM as well.

They really couldn't help. All they can see on their end is that the call shows as "not answered." When they tested making calls, they just got a single ringback and then a busy tone, same as I get.

I've tried forwarding to several different numbers. Results are...odd:

- My personal AT&T cell phone: fails

- My Google Voice number: fails

- The third-party service we're ultimately trying to forward calls to: fails

- A test phone number operated by [TestCall.com](http://TestCall.com) (804-222-1111): SUCCEEDS

- The Alaska Airlines main reservations line (800-252-7522): fails

- 3 other test numbers I found in this Reddit thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/911r3p/what\_number\_to\_make\_a\_test\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/911r3p/what_number_to_make_a_test_call/)

- 248-434-5508 and 909-390-0003: fails

- 925-259-0082 (echo test): SUCCEEDS

So the only two that work are explicit test numbers. The rest all fail.

The only thing the [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) support folks could come up with was either agreeing with me that it might be some kind of SHAKEN/STIR failure, or the receiving providers block calls from VoIP providers.

The only other thing I can think of is maybe more termination providers these days are set up to block calls that spoof Caller ID that belongs to a different carrier than the originating carrier? Except these calls also all fail when I just override the outbound caller ID with my [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) DID.

I guess I can bail on [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) and try another service, though VoIP.ms's hosted IVR is by far the cheapest solution for the very simple need we have ("If this is an emergency, press 1 to be connected to our after-hours support line").

> This question was secretly and silently deleted years ago by some mod for some unexplained reason shortly after I posted it. 

Purely to make the original question viewable, I've pasted the original text below. 

I am no longer looking for answers to my questions. No response is needed if you happen to stumble upon this post in 2023 or later.

----

I've actually installed asterisk on my work box, edited a dial plan, sent commands to a ATA, etc* so maybe I'm not a total n00b, but I'm at a loss on where to go to get started.

Currently: I have two prepaid cellphones. One with a number that I've had for 10+ years, so I want to keep it. I cut the copper landline years ago, and probably I can't go back. (Because...) I have FiOS at home (...and I doubt they would want to hook up the copper again). I have several boxes at home and would not be adverse to making up a new box running linux or BSD to run 24/7 as my answering machine/ forwarding box/ etc.

I want to ease in to this because I'm currently job hunting. The truth is that these prepaid phones kinda suck. Sometimes I don't get  my voice mail notification promptly. I do pay less than $12/month for the prepaid plan though. I don't make a lot of calls, but I do need to be accessible.

My rough plan of action would go something like this:

1. Get VoIP service from a provider and a new local phone number.

2. Build a box to run at home 24/7 to store phone messages, custom dial plans (ex-girlfriend and others), and manage a desktop VoIP phone that plugs in via ethernet (which I have not purchased yet). Probably no analog POTS phones at all unless it is a super cheap option vs getting a digital desk phone off ebay.

3. Forward my new phone number so it rings my two cell phones and my desk phone at work (during certain hours) at the same time, and takes messages if I don't answer (emails me an mp3 of the message, etc..)

4. Port my 10 year cell number over to my VoIP provider once everything is stable and to my liking.

5. (optional) Buy a used Android phone off ebay, flash firmware if needed, and use it without a cell plan for calls over wi-fi to my home asterisk box.

I saw a message a few weeks ago that offered advice for picking a provider, but what I'm really lacking is the VoIP lingo I need to intelligently evaluate what a provider can do for me.  **So (tl;dr) step 1 is probably "What do I need to look for with a VoIP provider in relationship with what I want to do as outlined above?"**

*(this was actually done to simulate a user picking up a phone, dialing numbers, etc. It allowed me to write scripts to do automated regression testing on work's souper seekret phone related box. So I'm perhaps not a total n00b but have zero experience with some aspects of routing SIP calls over the net, providers, etc.)

> I'm testing both. I was trying other systems as well. I have so much to do and too little time to get an answer.

Asking too many questions will get me too much information in a short amount of time. Each answer is a lead I can follow. I learn fast but I hate learning, so people answering my questions provides me with specific information I need to start.

Anyway, I'm Palestinian but my company is Israeli and work in Israel. So I have a few options for SIP Trunk providers. I just need to configure my PBX to use the correct service. One provider is actually a reseller for 3CX. I'll contact them after the holidays to check if I can get a better price from them than the price I have from 3CX themselves.

Thank yoy for the information!

> They will.... A small sale can eventually turn in to a big customer... Without doing all the research I wouldn't be able to say. I'm not a product expert. We generally Build out our own systems when we need them and Use SIP Trunking only as our backend. 

This is also a good test of the Providers overall service. As a small - Non technical user, how they deal with you when helping you build a solution from scratch is very telling on how they will deal with you if / when it goes wrong.

use the Web Chat... Explain clearly what you are trying to acheive - What features you want, and let them build you a solution and give you a price... Try a few providers - I am in the UK, so i don't know the product stacks currently available on the wider market. Don't be afraid to ask the providers questions - Even if you think it's a stupid question.

If you are looking at something you can build out, maybe look for a 3cx partner - they should be able to supply the Backend lines (SIP) + the Server / Software / Tools you need to get up and running - and manage for you. This may work out a little more expensive though.

Sorry I can't help much more - Maybe someone in your Region can give a more in-depth answer than me?

> Yeah - using your current handset is going to depend on the model of handset you have... More than likely the answer is no, but there are ways to do it.

One way might be something like a Citel TVA (or similar device) instead of individual ATA's.  They utilize the digital or analog lines to your current handsets and connect to a VOIP service. 

Lots of VOIP providers will bundle handsets with a contract.  Some considerations: are there existing Ethernet connections at the location of the handsets? If there is at least one there you can use the new handset as a pass through. If not, you will either need to run new wiring or ensure that the new handsets have built in wifi, and that the current wifi coverage has enough coverage and bandwidth. Most will also do some bandwidth testing to make sure that your network is ready for the service. 

With the dial plan you are talking about some providers will charge extra for the hunt groups and features. Just review the plans thoroughly before making a commitment. 

I work for a company that used to rep Panasonic and still has to support it for our clients.  I have preferences in the Voip market but certainly wouldn't push you in any specific direction.

> No worries. and Thank You for the compliments.

On the main page (before logging in) click on the Home icon. In the middle of the page you will see the ability to verify if a Number is eligible to be ported into CC. There is no charge to port in a number from other providers. Once you run the check, you can begin the process by logging in. Keep in mind a few things.You MUST select your Calling Plans at the very start of the LNP process. You may still change later if needed. CC does not discount for partial months.

Make sure you have the account PIN code for your old provider so they can release the Number. Do NOT cancel your old account until the number has been fully tested after the Port. CC is pretty good about giving you a status along the way. 

The new number can then be assigned a function under the Extensions tab (next to Dashboard). Here you configure what you wish to use each number for:  Answering a call on your home phone, using as a Fax number (sent to your Email), VoiceMail only, registered as a SIP service with an App for taking/making calls on your mobile phone, etc. The Zoiper app works well with CC for this purpose.

Keep going! Best of luck.

> You are asking about the Caller Name. What Number is shown on your display? You should still see your calling number as the incoming caller. Have you tested this with other friends and their phones? What anyone is able to see for CNAM is controlled by the phone service they are answering incoming calls from.

If they choose not to look in one of several databases (think phone books) that MAY have a name linked to the calling number, they can say it is coming from Unknown, Spam, Private or whatever. If you lock that number in your local Contacts and list it under SANTA that is what will show up everytime you call yourself from THAT number on THAT phone.

> The problem here is the quality of the result. 

For example, last week I was asked to bid on a legal project that wanted to run a Gemma 3 12B model locally for estate planning. This is a very low-powered model from a sophistication standpoint. It can, however be run on a consumer-grade GPU, if you have patience, as tokens per second is the equivalent of watching turtles have a race. 

Legaltech has some fairly sophisticated asks, so I ran some tests on this specific local model vs. the full foundational model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) across a series of related legal prompts. Pro had 100% faster responses vs. hosted Gemma 3 12B, but more critically, offered vastly superior and more accurate answers to this small model. **This should be the number one reason that you stay far away from small self-hosted models.** 

Now you can host a large model locally, or a medium model using a service such as Groq, but for the former, you are looking at $100,000+ for a single server.

> Well there is a whole discipline of enterprise architecture whose job it is to figure these things out: ask the right technical questions, analyse the answers, ask follow ups, ask for evidence of appropriate security standards (ISO etc), run tests, etc. This is then added into contracts. Any law firm dabbling in this stuff without a robust architecture and procurement setup is asking for trouble, though in practice there is something of a free rider effect on offer given all the other law firms that have these things worked out. It’s the same way they get comfortable with cloud document storage or Microsoft Exchange for your emails, etc.

So yes I suppose it’s possible that Harvey are saying there’s no model building with customer data, are providing a bunch of fake evidence of that, are misrepresenting in all of their contracts with law firms and none of their customers has figured this out. I suppose it’s possible that OpenAI are doing likewise with respect to Harvey. 

It would be game over overnight for Harvey if this were discovered (and it’s hard to see how it wouldn’t be). And given their game is either supporting as many professional service firms as they can or, if you’re right, taking their business, trust is probably more important than incremental improvements to their model.

> Real talk: The traditional "find a mentor" approach rarely works. Here's what actually works:



\*\*1. Reverse mentorship\*\*



Instead of asking "will you mentor me?", lead with value:

\- Share insights from your recent experiments

\- Introduce them to potential clients/partners

\- Contribute to their content/projects



I've built stronger relationships by helping experienced folks with things they don't have time for (research, testing tools, community management) than by directly asking for mentorship.



\*\*2. Specific, not general\*\*



Don't ask: "Can you mentor me?"

Ask: "I'm struggling with pricing my productized service. You mentioned charging $X for similar work - what metrics did you use to land on that number?"



People love answering specific questions. It's the vague "pick your brain" requests that get ignored.



\*\*3. Reddit/Twitter/LinkedIn threads\*\*



Honestly, you're doing it right now. Posting questions, getting feedback from multiple experienced people > one formal mentor. I've learned more from:

\- r/agency discussions

\- Indie Hackers threads

\- Product Hunt comment sections

\- LinkedIn posts with real numbers



...than from any formal mentorship.



\*\*4. Build in public\*\*



Share your journey publicly. When I started posting about what I was building and the problems I faced, experienced founders reached out to me offering advice. The mentorship found me.



\*\*5. Paid communities/masterminds\*\*



Sometimes it's worth paying $50-500/month to join communities where successful agency owners hang out. The ROI from one good insight > the membership cost.



\*\*Reality check:\*\*



Most "mentors" are just people who figured things out slightly before you did. They're not wizards. Read their content, apply their frameworks, ask specific questions when stuck. That's 90% of what formal mentorship would give you anyway.



The best mentor is launching, failing, iterating, and sharing what you learn.

### r/agency — 2025-11-09 | 1pts | `general`

> AI-powered SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is changing how customers find brands, evaluate options, and make purchases online. Here’s why AI SEO works so well:



AI SEO allows marketing teams to analyze large datasets about customer intent, search habits, and preferences. With machine learning algorithms, websites can be optimized for relevant content and keywords that resonate with individual users. This means that search results and on-site experiences are more tailored. Customers can easily find exactly what they need, which speeds up their decision-making.

Advanced Understanding of User Intent  

Traditional SEO often relies on fixed keyword matching. AI SEO takes it further by mimicking human understanding of queries and context. Natural language processing (NLP) helps search engines grasp nuanced questions, product needs, and pain points. This leads to a smoother and more logical user journey.

Real-Time Adaptation  

AI SEO tools constantly monitor changes in search algorithms and user behavior. They adjust strategies automatically. This can include updating content, optimizing for featured snippets, or enhancing technical SEO without needing manual changes. Customers see fresher, more relevant results, which builds brand trust.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)  

As customers increasingly use voice assistants, chatbots, and direct answers instead of traditional search results, AI SEO makes sure brands are easy to find in these new answer-first environments. If a consumer asks, “What’s the best wireless earbud for running?”, AI-powered sites that give relevant answers stand out and heavily influence decisions.

Predictive Analysis and Content Recommendation  

AI systems can forecast popular queries, seasonal trends, and changing market needs, ensuring brands stay ahead. They present the right content before customers even know what they want, making purchasing decisions easier.

Conversion Optimization  

AI SEO doesn’t just attract traffic; it also focuses on converting visitors. Algorithms test headlines, calls-to-action, landing page designs, and product placements to find what persuades visitors most effectively. This ongoing optimization greatly increases the chances of customer action.

Trust and Credibility  

AI SEO highlights authentic, trustworthy, and highly relevant information. For customers, this reduces uncertainty, simplifies comparisons, and builds confidence in selecting a solution or service.

> Part of the problem is that your are pigeon holed into “website”. When people think of you they think about a transactional engagement. I want a website and you give me a website. In reality, your customers have problems and the website can be the answer to those problems if positioned right.

For instance, why do people want websites? Probably to drive growth. Is the website driving growth? If not, what could you potentially do to help with this? You mention SEO which is a start but maybe you offer CRO services with things like
Monthly A/B tests?

Sell a solution to a problem rather than a tool. That’s the key to get MRR going. People need a website once every so often but they always need more business so try and anchor your business somehow to that and you’ll be shocked how fast the MRR adds up.

> I have been running a YouTube marketing agency for great brands for the last 8 years. Our mission is to be the best YouTube Marketing agency in the world. We provide YouTube Strategy, Packaging (Thumbnail/Title), Optimization/SEO, and Advertising.   
  
It has not been easy, but we have been fortunate to work with 200+ businesses, including some of the biggest companies in the world. If i were to start over, I would just focus on one specific area of offering as you're suggesting (Script Writing), or one specific type of audience. Each service offering ie Thumbnail Split testing, requires it's own SOPs/Processes, and specialists. That adds up when you consider the complexity of doing YouTube really well.  

We have hired multiple email outreach agencies, to try to generate leads, but found it to be spammy, and not as effective as our other channels. In that time, I think the game has gotten even harder to do it at scale. But here are the 3 most important things we learned for cold outreach: 

* Lead with a great offer, ideally one that's hard to refuse.    
* Have a couple Case Study references that are very specific to the ICP (Ideal Client Profile) you're going after.
* Avoid the spam filter, by warming up emails, doing proper DMARC setups, and caps on how many emails you send per day/ per email. 

The other sources we have been able to generate leads from include SEO, Google Ads, AI Queries, and Listicles recommending us as best YouTube Marketing agency. 

While we have grown to 7+ figures, we have grown and invested in our team and tools proportionally, so we don't have great margins. Happy to answer any questions.

> I’m a vet by degree, but vets didn’t need new business 2 years ago.

So I purchased a database subscription and picked a niche to cold call for 3 days to do market research. Did that for a month.

Was watching YouTube at the same time and ended up on Medspas. Found my first client a couple weeks after that.

Then it took me 10 months to find the Medspa service I would hyper niche on. Before that, I was testing different offers for the spas, trying to close packages for them over the phone so I could see the market’s reaction.

This month is actually a year since we found our hyper niche. Found it in October, fired all of our clients who either couldn’t participate or didn’t want to in Nov and haven’t looked back.

It really is all about saying “no”. A once in a lifetime opportunity comes every 6 months. The reason why I don’t really worry about my competition, is I know 99% of them lack focus and/discipline to say no.

I’ve had referrals that were doing 3x in adspend compared to all of my clients combined. The guy literally told me, “I will pay any amount of money for you to do for me what you’ve done for her.” The answer was No from me, didn’t even have to think about it. He didn’t fit my micro niche requirements.

Now I have a single client who does more than 3x what he does.

> Without working the typical 9-5…. We work mostly all hours or all days. The lies you see on YouTube are not how real people actually run agencies. 

AI = this isn’t going to be a viable service for a long time.  If it was easy to fine tune and get working flawlessly all agencies would be doing it. We are using AI for some highly rudimentary tasks in an app we are building that has been profoundly useful but complex AI usage is still a long ways out (depending on the task).

Finding Customers = this is literally the hardest part for every business type. It is the business part. You don’t have a business unless you have exchanged money for something that is not money. It is the single failure point of most businesses at most ages new and old. This is actually hard and it should be. I would argue that it can be the easiest part of an agency after your first 10-15 clients… but you have to get them and REALLY make them feel like they under pay you with results. 

SAAS = i think your questions around this make it hard to answer in a useful way. No good SAAS is going to be fast to build. The easiest way to test a business is this. Tell me who your target customer is in less than 10 seconds…. Tell me what major problem of theirs you are solving in less than 10 seconds…. If you repeat that to a potential customer can you show them in sub 90 seconds something really high value… if these are easy you likely have an actually good product if you start solving large scale financial problems. 

I own an agency with 15 employees, 10 years in business, 2 SAAS products created as a result. We created a Wordpress hosting company (because we have a LOT of people we do hosting for). This solves a problem for us… we are a large customer and it saves us money. It also allows us to direct people who are not ready for our services to a good place to host their site and reach out with questions. The second SAAS is an alternative to Mailchimp, Klayvio, etc… this took 2.5 years and was a $1m yrr business the day we launched it. 

The above is how most agencies progress over the years you find customer, fix problems, niche down to charge people in areas you are most beneficial with your experience and then make software to sell to the general public and stand it up on your agency. I have 6 friends who had 8 figure exits from agencies and this same story would explain 100% of them. Hopefully something in here is of use to someone :) cheers 🍻

> Personal take: websites are a tool. Just about anyone can build a website via squarespace or whatever. Now, it definitely won’t be the same quality as what a web developer could build. But most of these businesses will have some sort of expectation that this website will benefit them in some way. Getting people to sign up for their subscriptions, bringing more customers through the door, etc. In the long run, I would look for ways to add more value on top of a website. Social media services, ad campaigns, and the like. 

As for your original question, make sure you’re networking with people and letting them know what you do. All my best clients have been through referrals. The other typical answer you’ll receive is to target businesses with no website, or outdated website. These can be hard sells, because the owner may not see the value in having a website built or upgraded. So you need to offer and portray additional value, however that may be. Maybe you add a contact form that sends contact form messages right to a CRM (not as difficult as it may sound). Maybe you integrate something from DoorDash into the website. Maybe you build a few different landing pages and do some A/B testing. Just find a way to add value for your clients.

> Absolutely, harsh reality is no one cares what tech stack we use. Unless your customer/client is a dev themselves and they’re just looking to outsource a heavy backlog. 

It all depends on the specific customer you are trying to service, hence why niching down lends itself to higher quality in more than just the offer. 

You learn specific pain points, typical objections, risks, approachable prices and how to speak their language. The list goes on. This all helps in your messaging and making the sale. 

The only thing guaranteed to move you forward is to test then iterate with feedback and repeat. 

Here’s how our approach has iterated from when we started to right now:

2 years ago: translate your vision into a powerful online presence (websites) 

Now (2024): we provide done for you custom software for SMBs who can’t use ‘off the shelf’ products (apps)

Still needs more niching down but the direction is set by our clients not by us. They ‘show’ us where we can provide the most value and be most competitive in the market. It just comes with a lot more volume so we won’t have the answers with less than 10 clients. The key is to keep improving, keep learning, and keep iterating. 

We’re not meant to have the answers beforehand, we’re meant to work towards it.

> You may have answered your question. If you see most SERPs coming from Clutch and co then it makes sense to at least try to pay their fees. Clutch is $125 / month so if it brings you a single client that pays >$750 after 6 months it's worth it. Seems like a reasonable bet to make at least as a test.

FWIW I don't think that monthly fee is the real cost - you need to commit to succeed on any of these platforms. Offer services for free or cheap, collect plenty of good testimonials and ratings, etc. That takes time and effort way beyond what you pay the platform.

> The niche doesn't need to be high ticket.  The level of output your agency performs just needs to align with the niche.

Example:
We're a $500k agency with packages at $750/mo for SEO and Google Ads.

We serve all landscaping and lawn care clients.

A competitor of mine ONLY serves landscaping and lawn care clients over $1m in revenue and has minimum monthly packages of $10k that includes about $5k in adspend. 

He doesn't serve my market because I have lots of clients between the $100k and $1m mark as well as clients over $1m and even $10m.

However, my solution is a lotnless comprehensive than his. We do less work and thus charge less money to tap the undeserved market.

Regarding picking a niche, it doesn't necessarily need to be something you enjoy but you do have to learn to enjoy it.

My partner gave the example that you could be into video games and at your dentist you and your dentist start talking about video games. The conversation could lead to you talking about your agency youre starting and using him as a test client. Suddenly you get into the dentist niche.

I also suggest looking at the market cap of that niche. If it's a small market cap you're going to hit market saturation faster.

You also need to consider how much your potential client will make off of one customer. Then take how many customers you think you can help deliver to the client and divide it by your costs. Are they still profitable on a per client basis?

If the answer is no, then either you need to adjust your pricing, strategy, or that niche can't support what you're offering.

If you consider scuba, consider that all of your clients are likely going to be on the coasts.

Do you also offer services to competitors? If not you could hit saturation pretty quick.

Mixing skydiving would be good a good option as you have all of the inland space to avoid total saturation.

So if you do scuba and skydiving... your niche is really "Excursions"

And that opens you up to other things like white water rafting companies, zip line companies, and so much more.

But I would recommend just sticking with the two until you build up a solid base of those clients.

> See how you just asked a question?

I can now answer it. After I answer it, every single person that enters the post and reads the comments will see my answer. 

Sometimes, months from now, some one will face the same problem as me, the OP, and search about growing an agency too fast on Google. 

Then everyone that sees the post in Google, will now see this comment. 

So all I did was take some time to answer your question and now I've built evergreen content that, if detailed enough, will now generate interest in my services and build the perception that I am an expert at what I do. 

Then, some people will read this comment, and say "wow, this guy really knows his stuff." Then they'll go to my profile and start reading my posts and my other comments. 

Then they DM me and say, "hey I really liked what you wrote about X and I have Y problem. Can we set up a time to see if you'd be a good fit to take on this project?"

While everyone is acting like they're too fucking important to help other people--It's all I do. People think helping others is low ROI. These people don't understand how people buy AT ALL. 

I don't even purposely intend to generate prospects and it just happens naturally. I was so active on Reddit at one point, I was generating 3 calls per day as a freelancer.

I wrote this comment once about the Google Ads algorithm and how bandit testing prevents accurate A/B testing because bandit testing combines the exploration and exploitation phases of the experimentation process.

I made $90,000 in attributable revenue from that single comment in consultation fees alone--not even retainers.

> I think you will get the best solution here.  Im 24/7 testing strategies and getting clients without any kind of cold outreach. I answered  a lot of questions here and many other subs you can read. I run a white label SEO agency btw. But here I will just explain my stratgey and what I exactly do, so you can follow that.   


Just creating post on linkedin isnt a good idea. Linkedin has a lot of potential customers but its a little hard to find clients there compared to the other social networks. Because everyone tyring to find clients from linkedin, so it makes it compettive.     


Here's the steps exactly  you have to follow:    


1. Find some groups on facebook. If there's no exact groups that you're offering service for no worries, just imagine whats othe related groups that your ideal clients can hangout. Maybe gohighlevel group, because thats an agency group. Think like that.   Go connect only only with the profiles that matches your clients persona  

2. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing energy in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your energy on it.   
random prolfiles arent the solution specially when you're struggling.  So, it should be specific and direct.   

3. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing enery in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your enery on it.   

4. Now lets tak about the content. Its very important.Always save energy to put on somehting that works.  Now its AI generation, so use it.  Ask AI to create some topics that can trigger your ideal clients or attract them. Then the AI (Bard or GPT) will give you a bunch of catchy lines that you can use as headline. It really can attract because AI know the human psychology it has a lot of data. Then choose the best topics and craft your content.  Try to make them shorted instead of bigger version. But dont create too many contents,  try to create minimum and engage them first.   

5. Engagements:   Comment on other people posts, and groups.  Its more imprtant than your post. You can create one post weekly, but you should comment every day, even as many as you can.  For facebook groups,  find the best engaging posts and for linkedin find the thought leaders in your industry. Then go comment on thheir post. Any comment you add should be trigger people, so they reply you. start conversation, and this is how you get attention and over the time you you will potential clients.   


I think its enough for today to explain what I do to get most of my clients though. And it works 100000% because im doing almost same thing and scaling my agency better than any previous period.

> Hi, would highly recommend only going with setting up a general agency. I don't think this means just trying to do everything, but as an agency, you should be able to do all the websites that you have mentioned here.

So what you can do is, start as a general agency, **then with SEO**, have pages for each niche that you have mentioned here. For example, have your main website, then have /pages section and then /pages/lawyer-websites, this can be a template, that shows your process, the websites that you have built, the testimonials - and target all the keywords you want.

You can also do this with content, you can put content targeting all these keywords that you mentioned and then you will be providing a service to them. 

As an agency, you will be sending out contracts, constantly changing them to fit each client, with our product you can Get lawyer-level legal documents and revisions with our best-in-class AI: [Airstrip AI](https://useairstrip.com). If you want a document for a new client, you can tell our AI what to change, with the new terms, and you will get a new version of the document with those automatically made changes.

The documents have been tested and they are high quality, but if it doesn't provide accurate results based on your inputs, we can provide a full refund. Hope this answers your question!

> Gil made some really great points and he’s speaking from a more experienced POV. You mentioned a few points that I also want to add to having opened my own digital agency as apposed to SMMA. 

- The problem with just being a middle man is the inability to scale, problem solve and troubleshoot. You’re basically selling “shallow” service of posting on social rather than marking a brand on social media. There is way more marketing making then just being present on socials. It’s about shaping consumer behavior and analyzing performance to keep clients. There are tactics and strategies at play and trusting freelancers to keep your agency afloat is not the best move since they won’t care about your clients it company as much as you. What if they leave you high and dry. Not to mention client facing meeting where you might cover reporting and explains performance and next steps etc. You’ll need to have knowledge about the service you are offering. You’re still in high school take the time to intern for example and gain experience first before offering a service to companies via a freelancer. 

- Even if you feel like you don’t need to differentiate yourself… you definitely need to. Prospects usually shop around before they sign any contracts. They probably talk to 10 other agencies before deciding and if you’re not making a great impression and impressing them with you knowledge and what you can do for them then you can’t get clients and eventually scale and be able to charge more. And if they have questions that you can’t answer because if your lack of knowledge then you can’t build trust. 

- YouTube is a great way to learn strategies but again you won’t know if they work unless you test them and adjust to what works for you. Take everything with a grain of salt. A better option is to get certification from meta or other platforms that other them. This also build credibility with clients and peers. 

- Don’t go into social media if you don’t or can’t see the point in learning the skill. Freelancers come in all shapes and forms… usually in the marketing industry it’s more reputable to be part of an agency. I can’t say the same for graphic doesn’t for example. 

But again we are just offering advice having been through it. Good luck.

> No good answer, the expectations are just legitimately wonky. People in other industries don't understand, but you can't think about your day as adding up to 100% - it's 120%, or more. 100% client service PLUS additional time spend on everything else.

Agree with people saying its a test. Agree with people saying that if you can't or don't want to manage it, you should leave. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING!! I personally have about 1-2 years left of this in me. I just don't care about this job...climbing higher than I have...selling so that this company profits. I care about other things too and that's OK and probably healthy :)

Word of advice: take your PTO; take some bench time and really disconnect / use it to catch up on things. You don't need 110% utilization. The valleys enable the peaks. Until they don't anymore :)

> > Your messages are going in all directions and I don't know what your paragraphs about MBB have to do with BC Partners, but your post history is colorful so I'll bite.

BC partners was no more than a gentle nudge to your post where you wrote BC Partners instead of "BC Strategy" the name of the boutique in the original post. Nothing more. Obviously it wasn't a huge mistake on your part, hence me not making a big deal about it, but now that you try to put it on me....

MBB is literally because that's the entire topic of the thread....

> You work for a PE roll-up/have spent your entire career in the PE space don't you? It's a totally different job doing strategy at a large company vs doing strategy at your place.

No. Buy-and-build and PE were both a small part of my career. Currently I am at a public company, low billions revenue so not huge. None of the roles that involved strategy were in a buy-and-build.

>Broadly speaking
>your strategy is already decided the day the PE fund invests (wild oversimplification, but true in the grand scheme of things)
>.....
>A lot of the fund's focus is on transactions and transformation, not "strategy". There's not a ton of strategising that can be done effectively if you need to exit within 5 years

Agreed on all of the above, which is why corpdev roles in buy-and-builds never involve, nor claim to involve, strategy. 

> So of course you don't need an MBB and of course you don't see the value of MBBs. But your POV doesn't represent the entire market.

Not sure where you got the impression from that I "don't see the value of MBBs". As I said multiple times, I see the value there; they service the needs of the c-suite well and when I was in PE they served me well too. What I said was that other second tier management don't see that positive side of them, they only see the negatives. Hence the reasoning behind my entire argument; that FOR THOSE PEOPLE (note again not for everybody) the "ex-MBB" claim isn't as positive as it is to other consultants, or as it may be to the C-Suite. That has nothing to do with my opinion, nor with the actual experience itself. Purely the experience that those at the corporates often have who aren't the direct client. 

> No. What makes MBBs unpleasant is not the people or the culture. It's the fact that some projects are critical and the C-suite is watching. An ex-MBB boutique would likely not get CEO-level work, or at least not the kind that involves a broad engagement with the organisation, not least because they wouldn't have enough people.

Sure, but other projects are also critical and that is exactly what is raised by the SBU and division heads. The projects that they have can't get put on hold due to another project that is running. They also have the c-suite, ie their direct report, watching them throughout and they have to answer to the c-suite for any delays. The people and the culture absolutely aren't bad, agreed, otherwise the same firms wouldn't be filled with ex-consu

> Wide spread cheating in the graduate program application process, by people buying and selling leaked case studies and question banks

  
Only 2 years into my uni degree and considering applying to work for the big four, there are already numerous scandals, from WireCard scandal (auditor is EY) and the tax leak scandal by PwC (CEO just stepped down).

  
People wonder why these scandals seems unstoppable. I think the lack in integration started all the way from the beginning, tracing back to the graduate program application, when the consultants and auditors cheated through the application process when they, when the consultants and auditors first started with their career.

  
If anyone looks online, you see numerous cheating practice and popular service providers for the graduate application program, from applicants buying confidential online test question banks (sold for \~$300), to social influencers selling leaked case studies interview questions in real time with suggested answers (sold for $200), referrals sold for $3600 (oh god they are rich) and even business providing services to just do the online tests on behalf of the applicants.

  
Remember, these applicants are the future consultants working at the big four! And these online influencers often claim many people got in with their assistance.

  
And this is not even a secret. If you do a quick search, you see many influencers with thousands of followers. If you don’t cheat, you are put at a disadvantage. This is exactly what is happening with the PwC tax scandal isn’t it? The culture to cheat, to stay competitive?  
I sincerely hope someone would take action on these unfair application process. I have written to the big four but they seem to be too busy to take a closer look. I get it. They are not police. But would ethical companies not at least try to do what they can to make sure the graduate program application process is fair? As an applicant myself, I feel extremely unfair and frustrated but nothing much I can do.

  
I have collected some of the screenshots my friend shared with me as evidence. Happy to share if someone knows where to best report these people (example attached but I have more to share)

They lied about being compatible with Google Voice  though. I had weeks and weeks of trouble with them until I gave up on having them answer my firm's Google Voice number. It just wasn't working right until I transferred my firm's main number away from Google Voice and ceded it to Abby Connect. Now I don't have the ability to call people from my firm's main number, but each individual employee at my firm as always had their own Google Voice number anyway, so it's not too big of a loss.

It's obvious that they were lying about being compatible with Google Volce to get me sign up, and they were just pretending to be surprised about all the issues that we were having. Regardless, I use them now because they do a fine job and they speak both Spanish and English.

> I just got done launching my solo PI firm this first week of 2025! Thank you for this list, I definitely referenced it a few times. I will go ahead and provide my own list for others to see, I tried to put it in chronological order:

1. Use Secretary of State website to do name searches, call them to confirm, search google for similar names. Ask friends and family which of my "finalist" names they preferred. I was surprised how consistently lay people prefer "office" over "firm".

2. Buy several domains on GoDaddy for about $40 each, I spent like $160 on GoDaddy, this also includes the associated Outlook accounts, which is nice. I was able to purchase most of my "finalist" names and obviously the one I landed on. While my website URL will be the full PLLC name, its kind of long for an email address, "first.lastinjurylawoffice.com" since I was able to buy it as well, my email is a different URL, and just first.lastinjury.com. 

3.  Register PLLC, $40 state fee, free besides that. 

4. Pay Website and Branding Developers: $3,600. (negotiated from $3,750). Before making this hard decision, I bought the premium version of WordPress for $200 and spent a week trying to do this myself. I came to the conclusion I could spend another month working on it and still have a mediocre website. Fortunately the WordPress sub. had a free return policy, so I gave up. "Do you want to become an expert or pay an expert." If you plan on doing your own website to save money, and have no such experience, you need to start learning that process well before your expected launch date. 

5. Register EIN / draft W9, free. 

6. Register w/ State Dept Revenue, free

7. Register w/ City Dept. Revenue, $100. (fuckers also charge 2.25% of gross profits) 

8. Shop practice insurance. Landed on BiBerk because it was cheap and easy to get. $81 per month for $100k/$300k. If I have a big case come in the door that makes me nervous, I can up it to 1M/3M at any time for $124 a month. 

9. Sign up for CasePeer case management software, $80 a month after negotiating 20% off for first year, with 10% off all following years at about $90. 

10. Sign up for [Smith.AI](http://Smith.AI) virtual assistant 24/7 phone answering service. Negotiated down to $170 a month for first year, $285 is full price but I will do my best to negotiate something for 2026 as well. 

11. Sign up for Adobe Plus, $19.99 a month, this is my e-signature software as well. 

12. Upgrade one of the Outlook Account I purchased on GoDaddy to the Business Pro level for $20 a month. This puts the desktop apps on your pc and gives you a file explorer integrated OneDrive. Any of the cheaper plans are a pain in the ass to use and are web based only.

As a rule, the cheaper the VoIP service, the less the provider cares about call quality and customer service. Some years back I had a negative experience with a cheap VoIP provider (now out of business) that gave me an unreliable connection and poor call quality. I recommend you only use a provider that only gives their clients premium internet call routes, even if the charges are a little higher than others.

### r/agency — 2025-11-12 | 4pts | `churn_billing`

> There isn’t a straightforward answer to this as it depends on lots of factors, I’ve seen lots of agencies do incredibly well from focusing on single services or industries. I’d say it definitely makes it easier when you’re starting out as it’s much easier to create a compelling proposition for a single sector than for the mass market, and / or much easier to manage resourcing for a single service line than for 5. It might depend on what your longer term aspirations are for the agency, the niche you have in mind and also on where you’re based. If you want to build a $15M revenue agency in the UK market, you’d struggle to do that just targeting pest control companies for example as the market isn’t big enough. You could probably build a nice 15 person agency doing just pest control in the UK that made you decent money and gave you a fairly easy life though. Specialising in a larger sector (retail, travel, financial services, B2B) in the UK market would give you scope to grow a big agency while still having a niche. US market is much bigger so I’m sure you could build a big agency just focused on pest control, and a huge agency if focused on a bigger sector. It’s still possible to build a successful agency without a niche, but having a niche when you’re starting out definitely makes it easier.

We had certain specialisms that we focused on as an agency and those specialisms changed and evolved over close to 20 years as the agency grew, but we never fully niched down to a single sector or service. We actually started out with a very narrow focus (multilingual PPC) but that quickly expanded as we evolved and took advantage of opportunities that popped up. For example, we were only doing multilingual PPC but then clients were asking if we could also do multilingual SEO so we launched that. At one point we were doing a lot of multilingual work for retail clients and won some high profile accounts, which then attracted other retail clients that didn’t need multilingual work so we started doing English-only work too. We then wanted to set up in the US and initially intended to focus on retail as we had great creds in the UK, but found it really hard to gain traction without US retail client case studies - so we pivoted back to focusing just on multilingual campaigns in the US and grew very quickly as a result. Most of the multilingual work we won in the US was with B2B clients, which then meant that we could target other B2B clients that didn’t require multilingual work…

We never fully niched-down to any particular service or industry and managed to grow to 150+ people, but definitely benefited from focusing on particular sectors or services at different times as we evolved. Starting out with a more narrow focus and then building out made it lot easier than if we’d started as a full service agency targeting all sectors.

First things first you have to ask yourself - why would someone buy a website from you? When they ask what you do that’s better, what are you gonna say? When they ask about SEO and ranking better and what you do for that, what are you gonna say? What problems are you solving for them? What is wrong with their current site, why is it wrong, how do you fix it, and why are you uniquely able to fix it? Sales is the first Hurdle for most developers. It’s not easy. It’s a whole other way of thinking and now you have to talk to people, be personable, knowledgeable, and navigate the conversation skillfully to close the sale. It’s not about the website or their old one looking bad. It’s about what problems you solve. People buy solutions. And if you don’t have any, you won’t sell very much. So you need to work on that. What is your unique selling point, what do you do better than anyone else, and what problems you are solving for them and why it’s a problem. And if all you’re doing is slinging cheap crappy Wordpress themes then you are no better than Raj in Pakistan charging $200 on fiver. You can’t compete and you won’t solve any problems, which means you won’t get referrals or repeat business because your websites just sit there like their old ones did. It looks better. But they have no traffic and no conversions. Why? If you can’t answer that question then you aren’t ready to start.

Also Focus on how to use flexbox and grid, transforms, transitions, mobile first coding, positioning, differences between display block and Inline block, etc. very important to have the basics mastered.

I HIGHLY recommend finding a good designer to work with. You can find good ones for $20 an hour in Asia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. They’re amazing out there. My guy in Bangladesh is the core of my design team. I gave him a raise to $25 an hour. And once we keep growing I’m bumping that up too and taking care of them nicely. Design is hard. I try to do it myself sometimes, but it’s always just easier having someone better at it than you so you can focus on the things you do better and are more productive at. You’ll be glad you did.

Then there’s pricing!

I have two packages:

I have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance

or $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc.

$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself.

Lump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.

Nice, simple pricing. Simple projects. No databases. No booking features. No payment processing. Wanna know why? Because you don’t have to build everything yourself. There’s so many third party services out there that do niche specific booking services and perfected it for you. Just have your client set up a few demos with some companies and find the one that works best for them, their company rep will help

> They are out there but they'll make up an extremely small percentage of your clients. It's always funny when you make a post like this and the majority of the comments are from randoms saying "The problem is you! If you on board better all your clients will be perfect and pay you forever and never become a bad client!" Those people must not live in the real world, and must not own an agency because it's simply not true. 

  
The truth is, most clients are a nightmare. I recently had a client who I gelled with very much. Everything going great, lead volume up and costs down month after month. One day, out of the blue, he emails me and says "We need to pause everything after this month, we're putting our marketing money somewhere else" 

The last day of our service, he goes in and flips my campaign back on that I turned off. He just wanted to run our ads and not pay us to manage them. 

Then you have the clients where you think everything is going well, you're meeting your goals consistently. Providing WEEKLY reporting that proves it, and their friend who lives on the other side of the country looks at their ads and says "I know someone who can do it better than your current agency" BOOM - you're fired instantly without a single second of notice. 

Then you'll have the ones who hire their niece who's in high school to follow up with the leads. She calls the leads one time, 2 weeks after the lead signed up, lead doesn't answer the phone. Then little suzy goes and tells the owner of the business the leads suck. BOOM! Fired!

Or how about Mr Pest control company that hires your agency to rank them on page one of Google, you fulfill your promise and rank them on page one for ALL their keywords. Then you get the email, hey thanks for getting us ranked! We need to pause for a month and we'll get back to this. BOOM! Fired and ghosted. 

  
Or what about the client that hires you, and when you're building out there campaign, you go into the Google drive folder that you gave them a week ago to upload images and videos to be used for ads. The folder's empty, you email the client and ask for content. She says she will provide it next week. Next week the folder is still empty. You email her again and remind her you need content. She emails you back and says she's 33 weeks pregnant and doesn't feel like dealing with this. She says she's paying you enough money and you should be able to find content yourself (stock photos). You reply and tell her that we can of course use stock photos, but the ads won't perform as well that way. She replies and tells you that she wants a refund. 

  
These are just a couple examples of what we deal with on a weekly basis. For anyone blaming you and saying that all clients are perfect and will pay you on time every month with no complaints until they day the die so long as your onboarding call was up to par, doesn't actually have significant clients and has probably worked with a couple clients as a side gig over the course of th

> Yeah and soon the newbies realize the truth sets in. That u need to make a lot of mistakes and fail to move forward. Newbies get mad and down vote u for telling the truth. Then they expect you to do free mentoring and or think you're going to tell them this golden goose secret to getting clients and results. Typically the guru sent that newbie. 

I learned and earned my stripes through pain. Newbies don't want to invest in themselves financially, nor take this seriously, nor dedicate time, no execution... just bs tasks to feel busy like making a website?? Or websites smh lol. They bs on a pitch deck. They get a hard on because a guru gave them a few templates. They watch a "free smma course" on YouTube and come here to still ask questions. They are afraid of cold calling. Too broke to run paid traffic. Can't sell, can't close, and can't market. 

My favorite is "I'm a marketing agency but can't get clients" lol. So how were u going to get clients results? From my experience it's easier to get clients than results lol. They ask too many fear based questions that lead to procrastination. 

I joined reddit to drop knowledge and exchange knowledge with like minds to stay sharp. If a newbie asks a real question that I can answer from my experience then I'll answer. 

Yes, OP ur right the newbies should get a job in the industry they want to provide service in. Study the niche inside out. What does the client day look like? What are the client's customer pain points??? A HVAC guy talks differently from a chiropractor....a chiropractor is not going to sell - at least not hard sell. An HVAC guy (most home service guys ) will hard sell for survival...so you're dealing with 2 different animals.

> All of our clients come to us off of a bad experience with another agency.

They tend to stick around once they see our process product results that positively affect their bottom line.  Our contracts are month to month and can be cancelled anytime without penalty.  Our avg tenure on our client roster is 7 years.

To answer your questions:

The faster I've ever closed a deal was at the end of the initial discovery meeting, when I gave the client a price and he said yes.  We swiped his CC that day in my office.

The slowest?  Probably 6 months.  In my experience, 90 days is pretty typical for our sales cycle and if they drag their feet much longer than that, it's not going to happen.

Purely relying on referrals and the odd cold outreach.  Every single client on our roster is a result of a preexisting relationship.

We don't work with startups so I don't know if interviewing me would be beneficial.  We work with service based companies, specialty retail, ecommerce and manufacturing types of business primarily.

> I gave you honest feedback and you shouldn't get defensive like that, because you know that I'm right.

How many times did you see a professional working with Fortune 500, copy-paste some screenshots from Stripe/Facebook Ads?

I'm going to tell you how many times: ZERO.

No case studies and no testimonials. Just a bunch of logos to "look legit" to a really gullible – and probably young – audience.

A picture that was taken with the camera of a cellphone with bad lighting.

No footer with a legal entity, an address, a privacy policy... nothing.

Not a single section explains what you do, how you do it, or why you are different.

A website that looks super sketchy with some cropped screenshots slapped on it – you can literally take a free theme from WordPress/Ghost/Whatever and it would look 2.000 times better. You can pay a guy on Fiverr 30 $ and they will give you something legit to use. No need to be a Senior Graphic Designer.

Last but not least, it's not about being on Reddit; there are thousands of multi-millionaires wasting time here. Even in this sub you can find some really successful people that interact with others just to help them out – or because they want to wind down with some light activity – like me right now.

But you are literally sending messages to kids that want to start their "SMMA" so you can pitch them your services – I checked your post history before.

Do you think this is what an expert of that caliber does? Because if the answer is yes, then I'm JESUS CHRIST!

At least don't treat people like idiots – by calling them negative when they point to you the obvious discrepancies between what you say and who you truly are.

Anyway, I wish you the best of luck with everything!

Take care,

Luca

> Way too complicated. ggildner gave the right answer. I suggest you listen to them.

I also second that this brings in low quality clients. We all start somewhere though. You gotta deal with the bottom of the barrel as a noob. 

If someone offers me free or overly cheap services, alarm bells go off. I don't want free, I want high performing with a fair price. Free is not a selling point to real businesses. 

Forget the dinner. Nobody cares. 

Instead of focusing so hard on the offer, focus on some x-factor that makes you different. "I discovered this one thing that most media buyers don't know about" etc. 

Good luck! Come back and let us know how it goes.

> I took FMLA for depression when I worked in professional services. My manager, who was the main reason I could not take it anymore, asked me why I was taking leave and my answer was “my doctor recommended I take this time to focus on my health.” This manager unfortunately took over the communication plan, told me not to tell anyone I was taking FMLA. I have no idea what they told who. 

My time off gave me the necessary space and distance to work on myself and realize that the environment was detrimental to the point of being dangerous for my health. The SSRIs did their work, I found pleasure in my hobbies and started rebuilding a life outside of work. I also focused on figuring out an exit strategy. Having that more formalized when I got back to work made me feel far less anxious. 

The truth is you don’t know how people will react to your LOA. Some people will be idiots. Some people won’t care. Some people might take it as inspiration and take their own leave (I took leave because a friend did it and I saw how their life changed). But you have control over how you take care of yourself with the tools and resources at your disposal. So use them.

> Yo....  So...

How does ICE know where people work?   Because It's on their I-9 form.   When ICE shows up to an address with a list of names?   Those people are hired on a I-551, I-776, or I-94 form.  They pass E-Verify, and are documented legal employees.   Who under executive order are being subject to extrajudicial revokation of legal status and removed from the United States, or detained, or shipped to El Salvador.   Lots of options there.

The key word here is documented with legal status.  That's why ICE knows where they live and work.  Because the have legal documents.

The undocumented / illeagals are a totally different story.   That being said if you want to wash dishes, dig ditches, work in a slaughter house or do agricultural labor, there's not enough illeagals to fill those jobs and they will take you.  I've met some of the owners.  They take anyone with a pulse same day, and can never find enough people.

Back to subject at hand.  

This is R/consulting.  So if you can't talk the talk why would anyone take you seriously.  

Lovely troll comments.

But when I file a change order or contract claim for $2,000,000 of labor costs due to a site shut down from an ICE Raid on on of my projects that cost us a 2 day delay and a million dollars a day of labor?  And now we have further delays and ICE related litigation. Between Owner, Prime Contractor, 3 dozen subcontractors, internal and external legal counsel, not to mention a dozen consulting firms on different sides of the problem?

Like just sorting out that mess is a full time job for like 6 people for at least a year.  Been there, actually have the t-shirt.   Which is another million dollars or more in service labor costs.

Then say legal action - jeez, now the lawyers cost another million on each side just to explain to the executives and shareholders there's nothing they can do other than accept it, pay for it and move on.

So end result is several million dollars of extra cost in ICE disruption remediation.  Not to mention the weeks of overtime, missed family time, closed door arguments, and meetings.

All because ICE showed up in Masks and Guns, and decided to Revoke the working Visas of a security Gaurd and a Junior electrician that were I-551 or I-776  legal immigrants with Federal Employement Authorisation.   And the wrong tatoos.

So legal counsel is basically telling me the best strategy to deal with ICE is basically to hide them, keep them quiet, and give them whatever they ask for as quickly and quietly as possible, as to save the millions of dollars of problems that happen when masked guys with guns roll up on the security gate.

Seriously.  According to ICE statistics Last year over 200,000 immigrants were peacefully and quietly removed from the United States with Due Process and NOBODY CARED.  The news media didn't care, none of us knew it was happening or didn't worry about it.

> Thanks for this very insightful answer!

"Older guy who wants to tell war stories" made me laugh out loud, I KNOW "that" guy. 😅😅

>yea, some of those folks are pricks. But also, you are discussing a competing idea and probably a bit naive in your own way (not bad, just you don't know what you don't know having not been on that side of the table

You are very correct in your assessment of naivete. I did have many of those conversations fairly early in my career and I really had extremely limited understanding of their world. I've worked very hard to improve on that aspect, but it has been admittedly challenging trying to look into the kitchen from outside the house.

Some key takeaways from what you said that I am very happy to have you confirm are:

1. SMEs are an untapped market because they are extremely hard to convert (Found out in practice)
2. You need to package everything you do and frame it as a clear "product" or "service"  (I struggle greatly with this)
3. Tons of success happens in silence, away from the spotlights
4. To say that networking is key would be an understatement

In a nutshell, these 4 things that you highlight are essential, and happen to be some of the things I struggle most with, so my limited success should be no surprise at all.

Looking at the advice someone else gave, I have also started down the path of getting a very specific specialization (M365 and Azure for business intelligence, AI, process improvement, automation), in the hopes that it would open doors for me to address some of those issues. For example, being able to brand myself as an implementation partner, a specialist with clear deliverables, being able to set price relative to truly comparable offerings, and having the opportunity to speak/present at events on topics that "pull in" people by interests to kickstart networking.

I really gotta figure out how to get better at these things ASAP. 

Thanks again!

> I decided to respond because my life was changed by doing precisely this. It isn't for everyone, but my desired lifestyle needs autonomy, and it is impossible to get that in a big company, especially as you are climbing the ladder.

1. 8 years ago, I dropped my normal job with vesting in retirement and stock and even gave up my health insurance to start a small consulting firm in an unrelated field.  Consulting on your own puts a much larger portion of your hourly in your pocket, and having a firm puts a portion of your employees' hourly in your pocket, but you are responsible for getting the gigs...

2. 50% of our clients are organic word-of-mouth which took considerable time to build, the other 50% resulting from marketing/direct outreach.  It is industry dependant, but our industry involves highly regulated or otherwise public governmental processes, so our client pool is easy to get data for.

3. Branding is different for an organization than an individual, being a thought leader is important for both.  I like to think of our firm as a brain trust in our field, and i have rounded out our staff around this goal.  I never wanted to be a sole proprietor - you can only crank your hourly so high... and you have to do actual work for every dime you make.  To me, it's better than working at a firm in terms of autonomy but it has a hard cap on revenue.

4. Clients have all sorts of different needs. Our projects are varied, but we typically treat each new project type as a 1-1, and if it can be turned into a repeatable or automatable and marketable process, we make an SOP and if possible convert it to a fixed price deal

5. I never started solo, but with a partner and one employee.  We staffed up pretty quick - as having additional revenue streams for the business makes everything easier and you can eventually afford support staff for admin.  We have had success doing some "lower level" consulting in adjacent areas, preformed by lower paid staff.  It's allowed us to take on more types of projects.

6. Colaboration with other consultants is great, either through a direct collaboration, a pass-through, or just a referral (fee). Just write a good agreement. Around year 4, I noticed that we were referring a lot of the same type of work out to third parties on a regular basis, so I brought in-house any of the services we could reasonably provide, and monetized the referrals going forward.  

Partnerships can be great - and also awful.  Have a good agreement - but that is only 10% of it.  It's a relationship not unlike a marriage.  I have a great situation with now two partners, but we have clearly delineated roles and responsibilities with no overlap and complete autonomy.  They are good humans, we've established extensive rules for governance and decision making, and we have SOP's for every process... and it still gets really shitty sometimes.

7. Make long-term life goals before you make career goals. YMMV.  You have to do some real soul searching.  For

> I'd use a BATNA type of thinking. If you don't agree to their offer, what's likely to happen? Do you walk with essentially the same payout but no noncompete? Then you have negotiation room. In the opposite extreme, do you get no severance, and you actually signed a binding noncompete when you started the job? Then you're sorta stuck.

As an alternative to trying to get an attorney consult, if free is not an option and you doubt it's worth it, I just tried and for my jurisdiction ChatGPT gave a - to the best of my knowledge - accurate answer when asked what were requires as well as usual practice severance practices for professional services professionals.

I then asked it, again with the context of my jurisdiction, what would be an appropriate adjustment for a 12 month noncompete, given 18 months job tenure, and it said "a few months" extra severance. I have no idea if that's reasonable, but you doing the same experiment with your own jurisdiction in the question you ask your favorite genAI may guide you whether it's worth paying a lawyer to explore further.

> This is a post I published in my newsletter that hopefully will inspire a few.

👇

You cannot really learn the consulting business in school. 

In the real world, the process is more like serving back-to-back apprenticeships, under a rogues’ gallery of masters. 

It happens in the office, in open spaces and in conference rooms. It happens in airports and hotels. It happens after too many coffees and it happens with one too many drinks.

You move to New York, Milan, London, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Singapore. True story.

You network. 

You befriend analysts just like you, slaving away putting PowerPoints together at ungodly hours. 
And you buddy up to the Senior Managers, and the Directors, and the Partners with their names always listed first on proposals. You put in face time, work for peanuts, take on grunt work nobody else wants.

You teach yourself.

You tackle projects working from 7am to 10pm, Monday to Sunday for 55 days in a row, with half of your team members speaking a language you can’t understand. You vow you will be leading engagements your way before you turn 30. 

Day One as an analyst, some fast-talking senior consultant asks if you validated the KPIs to set a success baseline.
“Validated what?”

You teach yourself.

You take a training course. Then 10 more. You get PMP certified. Then TOGAF, then something else. Maybe you literally go back to school and study your way to an MBA. Eventually, you’re glad you didn’t. 

You pore over old decks and books on strategy and frameworks. You read manuals on how to write and how to think. You learn how to speak - I mean, you know how to speak but can you persuade and influence?

Partners and managers give you harsh feedback tearing apart all slides you submit. You’re thrown in the sh*t, dismissed as useless and exploited as cannon fodder. 

Your bosses take your time, drain your mental stamina, run you ragged. You let them. 

You let them, because you know that is the price to pay to grow.

You get forwarded an email with no context. The instructions are simple: “Can you get it done?”

You teach yourself.

And you get it done.

Your consulting buddies become your network. One gets hired somewhere else in a bigger role and pulls the whole group up. You are that one.

Your boss calls, asking you to finalize a response to an RFP for a big client. By tomorrow. “Can you make it?” Of course you can.

You teach yourself. 

Alone at your laptop, struggling to answer the fundamental consulting question: “How the f*ck does this sh*t come together?”

Creative epiphanies and breakthroughs come slowly after banging your head for hours when that intricate set of Excel formulas finally stop giving #REF! errors. 

Each baby step forward matters when you tally small wins into big results.

Over months, years, and decades, the pieces come together into a puzzle so complex you have no idea how you managed to solve it (or, did you actually solve it?). 

You can point to a governance framework you built for a pres

> I am so sorry about your Mom’s diagnosis.

My Dad recently had a heart attack and had to be resuscitated outside the hospital, followed by time in the cardiac ICU, double bypass surgery, and cardiac rehab. I had to tell my boss because I basically disappeared for a week, and then had to figure out care after the hospital. But I think being proactive with HR and your boss is the way to go. If it is financially/policy possible for you, consider going part time, or getting a formal accommodation to work less as needed for appointments. 

There was a great answer above and I agree with @stumbling_coherently’s comment. A couple things to add, the emotional stress of making decisions and coping with news and my parents’ emotions took a physical toll on me. I had several days where I felt like I had the flu, with achy joints and headaches that I think were from clenching my entire body for hours at a time. Please make sure to book in time for yourself to rest and take care of yourself.

Ask your Mom’s hospital if they have a social worker to connect her and you to services that can help. I signed my parents up for meals on wheels for the duration of cardiac rehab. It gave me peace of mind knowing someone was physically checking on them mid day and that they would have at least one balanced meal a day that I didn’t have to cook. If your Mom qualifies, you would qualify as a caregiver.

As for informing work, start with HR, with an email so that it is in writing and you don’t have to deal face to face on an emotional topic. I’d ask:

1) Is it possible to add a dependent parent onto our health insurance plan?
2) What are the policies and procedures for temporary accommodations for caring for a family illness?
3) Am I eligible for FMLA (family and medical leave act) leave?

I put the last one on there because I was not, which made everything murkier, but if you’re full time, at a firm >50 people, and have been there a year, you are.


That way you can approach you boss with a plan. There is a lot of uncertainty, but you can start with planning the next month and set up a time to reassess and plan from there.

Again, I am sorry about your Mom’s illness, I hope her treatment goes well, and please take care of yourself too.

> I’m not a lawyer, I’m a growth strategist  and fractional CMO for lawyers/ firms and you’re getting amazing advice here. 

A few things I’d add: 

1. Wordpress website all the way. Make sure whoever builds it sets it up with good SEO and meta data for google to crawl.
2. Make sure there’s a way to connect or call you off the website. And ensure you have voicemail or get a service like Smith.ai to help.
3. PPC ads are a great start getting regular traffic to your website. If you have more than once practice area, create a campaign that goes to that practice area page in your site. 
4. Set up your google my business profile and keep it relevant.  Ask past clients for reviews google or set up an Alphafox account and connect it to fb and gmb.
5. Use HubSpot or Clio Grow and set up (or pay someone) to set up automations and tasks to remind you to follow up or send a reminder etc 
6. Yo already know you need to network so make that a priority 
7 Use LinkedIn to grow your online network and spend 10-15 min a day building it 

Once you’ve got some clients going and you want more or you’ve hired on a few paralegals or a few more attorneys then there’s advanced marketing strategies I’d recommend that will attract 10-30 new potential leads a day. 

I’m excited for you. I hope it goes well! 

If you’re got more questions feel free to ask.

> What do you practice?
I don't have a recommendation for a provider, but my only word of caution would be that while a service can lighten your non billable load, it can also carry a price. A lot of legal shoppers want quick comfort or answers and will more often than not stick with the first lawyer they can connect to on the phone. If using a service, build strict protocols for how quickly to book a meeting, or rules around immediately tagging you in on certain types of  matters so you can build that relationship first.

> Congrats on your first client! Honest advice: stop boosting posts. From my exerpeicne it rarely converts for law firms.

Instead, start Local SEO immediately. This is your long-term engine. It involves:

* Google Business Profile (GBP): The core element. It puts you in the "Map Pack" for local searches (e.g., "lawyer near me").
* Citations: Listing your firm in directories.
* Reviews: Social proof.

PPC (Google Ads/Local Services Ads) buys instant visibility at the top of search results but requires a budget.  We often see smaller practices and solos try to compete here initially and waste budget due to a lack of ability to answer the phone in time and convert. Since funds are tight, invest into your GBP now. SEO takes months to mature; starting today builds your future pipeline.

For the GBP if you have a physical location, you'll have the best chance of ranking for target search terms. Then it's a matter of building the reviews. While you have some time, I'd also recommend you build a YouTube channel and start answering questions on video. You would not believe the power this has in terms of marketing in a world where every answer is AI. 

  
Best of luck and feel free to reach out any time if you have law firm marketing questions.

> Hello! I know this post is years old at this point, but I noticed that no one actually answered the question. So for you, and anyone else who is curious -- yes, The Advocates and Targeted Legal Staffing Solutions are both very legitimate companies! They have the same address, list the same processes and have similar website copy because they were both founded by the same person who is currently president/CEO of both. The difference is that The Advocates works with exclusively lawyers, associates and partners, whereas Targeted Legal works with support staff and contract workers/temps (paralegals, legal assistants, office managers, and attorneys doing contract based work). There are various employees (like marketing, HR and admin) that work on both sides of the sister firms, but each company has a separate team of recruiters that are familiar with the specific market they are recruiting for. The Advocates has been around for over 20 years and has been Forbes ranked multiple times, and they work directly with many AmLaw 100 firms, hence the early access to opportunities, due to their relationship with various firms they also have the ability to directly present candidates to firms even if the firm may not be actively hiring or have any open job postings. I have worked with them in the past and they were very thoughtful, kind and professional and it felt different from working with any recruiter I've ever met in the past. If you are a law firm or working in the legal field, I highly recommend checking out their services!

> A few recommendations for you. Full disclosure, I'm a digital marketing agency owner in the DC area and one of our niches is working with law firms. I don't currently work with a PI law firm, but happy to speak to my experience in general with magazine advertising. 

My advice about magazines:

I've seen very few investments where the return on investment (ROI) was positive or even good. That said, I'm all for people trying something new as long as they measure it!

How to measure magazine results: 1) tracking phone number 2) QR code where link clicks and submissions or calls are tracked.

  
What I do know about PI and other law specialities from the ABA's marketing report:

First to answer the phone wins the lead

A solution for this that I use personally: Blazeo. On my website (https://bluehuki.com/) you can try out the chat and you can call the number and they will answer 24/7. When I was thinking about adding on the phone service they had PI examples that were great - did a full case intake. I will say that for both services they are a fraction of the cost of hiring someone to do it.  They also offer other languages if that is a need too.

Highly recommend just us⁤ing an answering service that specializes in law firms. Don't use a generic one that answers for tons of industries.

It's the difference between a significant amount of heavy lifting setting up a call center vs snapping your fingers and having people answering the phone professionally in a day.

Not to mention it's less than 1/10 of the cost. I found this company called Inside Out Law Calls last year, and I've been working with them since.

> I’d say the biggest thing to remember with small firm websites is that you don’t need something flashy, but you do need something professional, easy to update, and built with SEO in mind from the start. A clean site with strong attorney bios, practice areas, and a simple blog/news section can go a long way.

A few lessons I’ve seen firms learn the hard way:

* **Avoid “locked down” platforms** like FindLaw or other pay-to-play services. They tend to overcharge, underdeliver, and make it hard to update your own content.
* **Wix and Squarespace** are fine for DIY, but they usually hit a ceiling if you want to grow traffic, run SEO, or make the site look truly polished.
* **WordPress** is the standard for law firms. It gives you total control, is SEO-friendly, and lets you easily post updates or articles without needing a middleman.
* **SEO matters more than you think.** Even if referrals drive most of your work, a well-optimized site helps establish credibility and can bring in co-counsel or higher-value cases you might not have expected.

I work with law firms on web design and marketing, and what I usually recommend is: start with a clean, conversion-focused WordPress site that reflects your brand and is easy to manage. Then you can layer on SEO or paid ads later if you want more traffic — but you’ll already have a solid foundation.

> If you were a client of mine (former marketing and operations executive for law firms, and now have my own company), I would have a couple recommendations. 

Those services can work, but I would do two things. One, narrow your focus to a niche that you feel your USP (unique selling proposition) will drive referrals from other attorneys. This can be your proverbial “bread and butter”, and still take other Misc type of cases while you’re building your practice. Two, once you have that niche, create the best way to sell that value. Once you have those knocked out you can start networking with other law firms and it will create a better flow of cases than will help you create sustainable growth. 

Keep your client acquisition costs as low as possible, while also building sustainability. If you get some cash inflows for marketing, then have a marketing medium lined up that will allow you to bring in some leads quickly. Now, even with that I would generate those only for the cases that fit the first point I made. 

Happy to answer any questions about that if you DM me. 

Wish you well!

Generally if I’m trying to get an appointment with any service, unless that service was specifically and highly recommended to me, I will call around until I have an appointment that’s convenient for me. This is true of most people, and thus you want someone real answering the phones 24/7 if you’re in a consumer-facing practice area.

> So, I kind of do a hybrid. California family law. I’ve been on my own for about 2.5 years and was at a firm before that. 

I will say that I do zero advertising. I am currently (knock on wood) 100% word of mouth referrals. Back when I was at a firm, we did paid advertising and 100% paid consults. While I didn’t handle the intake calls (we had an office manager for that) I do know that we charged $475 for a 1 hour consult and that a lot of the potential clients from the paid services dropped off when they heard about the cost. Great! Fine. They probably wouldn’t pay anyway. 

Now I usually only do paid consults when I *don’t* know the potential client is coming from a good source. I know the source because, before I speak with anyone ever, I have them fill out an online intake form. The intake form isn’t just for conflict checks but also asks about salary, property and who referred them. If the potential new client refuses to fill it out, fine but we’re not talking unless and until they do. 

That said, I work with a number of entertainment lawyers, real estate lawyers, business managers and the like. Let’s say I did a divorce for Actor A two years ago and Actor A’s entertainment law attorney, John Smith, passed along my contact information to Actor B, who the entertainment lawyer also represents. I might see that Actor B wrote on their intake form that John Smith referred them. I’ll do that call for free because, almost invariably, I’m the only divorce attorney this person wants to bother contacting. Assuming I seem normal on the phone, 9/10 times, they’ll hire me by the end of the call. 

If I don’t know the referral source, I’ll take a look at what the potential client wants and what their resources look like based on answers to the intake questions. In the US, you can very easily look up addresses and home values on Redfin. If they live in a $7M single family home and they want a prenup, I probably won’t charge for a consult, because it’s probably a good case and the call is unlikely to take too much time. They probably just want to talk to someone professional and nice and check that box and be done with it. If I can’t read into the information on the intake form AND I don’t know the referral source, I’ll likely charge. 

All that said, I think those online referral things are absolute shit. You’re probably better off networking with other lawyers and advertising in a hyper local way. Other lawyers are a terrific resource because 1) when people need a family law attorney, they’re likely to ask for a referral from the only lawyer(s) they know and 2) if someone can afford the first lawyer, they can probably afford the second. Try meeting with trusts and estates lawyer, real estate lawyers and small business type lawyers. Get to know them so you’re the first person they’ll recommend when someone calls them and asks for a divorce referral. Secondly, hyper specific local advertising is probably the way I’d go if I did advertising. There’s an eleme

> Here are my suggestions with some reasons.

Use WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.

Get at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.

For bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.

Consider having an answering service to present a "bigger" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.

For hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:

Printer with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.

Sheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.

Get a flatbed scanner if you need it.

Get fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.

Get a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.

Get a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.

Software oriented tools:

Please read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)

Notice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the à la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.

Of course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.

You need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with

> Assuming this is not a contingency firm 

1.  Knowing what you’re going to sell (creating solid offers people can’t say no to and will give you the money up front in advance)

2.  Deciding what you’re not going to sell (to prevent you from taking whatever that comes in the door; blowing up your processes and systems)

3. Determining who you’re gonna sell to (there are people/personalities more likely to buy from you.  Target them with marketing (eg attending events, social media posts, placing ads, etc)

4. Figure out how many offers you gotta sell each month to break even each month.  

I recommend Clio suite, malpractice insurance, biz insurance, a virtual practice model (if your practice area allows), a bank with low or no monthly fees, quickbooks, and a one page website that tells who you are, how you can help, with an intake form (Clio Grow) and phone number to an answering service integrated with Clio Grow (or depending on practice area and business model, a phone number with an automatic greeting that new client intake is done online only via intake form).  

Then spend real time marketing.  Get out there on foot, online and establish yourself as the go to person for whatever you’re selling.

> With a single ad in a local directory and some worthwhile people referring or in your corner, you'll be just fine. Lawyers are always in demand, and the best ones are always  the ones with a life.

Dont get cornered into the perception of what a lawyer is expected to suffer thru with this or that person or firm. There are 12 lawyers in my family, and all worked for three years max before going solo practice. Solo practice means a hit some months with the rental space costs and if you need notary services etc, but a great- vetted- tactfully chosen- secretary means the time is wittled down significantly.

 If budgeting for reduced income at first, I highly recommend (at least for consults and contracts) time slots at office buildings instead of entire office rentals when meeting with clients. Depending on your law specialty, it can be awesome to be a solo lawyer- and the key in many places is your people. Your tech guy-  client info and seamless website, which is easily used on any device, and is set up to not allow junkmail. Internet reputation.

Answering service and proficient/ experienced secretary that can truly lighten the load with intake, and proper investment in software to automate many forms with template banks and support. 

Otherwise, work is easier when you get enough sleep and don't resent the hours spent watching your kids grow up at weekly dinners that are often spent half mentally dead from stress.

> My only answer is a lot of time. DV cases aside, family law is generally an area of law where everyone sucks fairly equally just in different ways. You’ll get a client. Hear their side. Feel awful for them and become emotionally invested. Then you’ll get to know them better when the other side sends screenshots of your clients text messages, or youll find out your client hid that she had a vacation home in a family trust.  They all lie to varying extents and most of them are trying to pull one over on the other or try to get their atty to make the other’s life miserable. In the midst of that, you get paid $$$$.

Your job is to provide a legal service. That’s it. You aren’t there to save anyone from themselves or fix anyone’s life. That’s what therapy is for. Family court is also generally the Wild West. All you can do is tell the court what happened and hope they rule in your favor. There’s very little law to argue and you can’t control what the court does. You are there to argue on behalf of your client and to know what to ask for. Set boundaries on that. When you start getting stressed. Stop what you’re doing and take a minute to remember that boundary. Reset your nervous system. Make good habits like this in the beginning and it will help. Also if your client is super emotional or thinks you can fix everything, recommend that they take that part up with their therapist.

### r/LawFirm — 2024-11-28 | 1pts | `positive`

> Hi there

I am the owner of LexScaleUp, a digital marketing agency specialized in helping law firms, so I can provide a bit of perspective on this.

The short answer is yes: SEO, search and social media advertising can help a wills and estate practice grow.

Let me explain why:   
  
From a marketing point of view you have two types of actions:  
1/ Demand capture actions, which aim to capture existing demand for legal services (people who are actively looking for an estate law firm)  
2/ Demand generation actions, which aim to generate demand for legal services (people who are not specifically looking for a solution right now, but they could be interested)

The content you will deploy to capture demand will be different than the one you'll use to generate demand. And not all channels are good at both capture and generation. 

Search (SEO and ads) is one of the channels that works great on both side of the equation (which is why Google is so valuable as a business):   
\- You can capture existing demand by targeting search terms like "will solicitor near me", "estate attorney near me", "best will law firm in \[location\]", etc.   
\- You can generate demand by targeting search terms like: "what does getting your affairs in order mean?", "when should one plan for end of life?", "Is it worth writing a will in 202\[5\]?"

Social media advertising is also good at both, though it is better at generating demand than capturing it. This is because you don't go on Instagram to look for a solicitor, you go to see updates from your friends, memes. You might stumble upon an ad about a will solicitor just as you were thinking about getting yours done, but that's not why you went on social initially. 

So typically, the way you would use social media is as follows:   
\- You would run a demand generation campaign: for example an ad saying "Have you got your affairs in order? Discover the 10 steps 40+ years old should take to avoid family disputes after their passing." (that's just an example). Now, people who click on this ad could be interested in getting their will done, we've generated the demand!  
\- Then, the next step would be to capture the demand we've just generated. For this, you would retarget everybody who engaged with the previous ad with a demand capture ad, for example: "10% off will writing at [Example.com](http://Example.com), get your affairs in order today!".    
\- And then we would layer another retargeting campaign on top, targeting everybody who has been on your website and hasn't converted into a lead/client with case studies and other brand focused content aimed at helping them choose your law firm: "Highly recommend [Example.com](http://Example.com), I used them to write my will, now I have peace of mind knowing that my affairs are in order - John Doe"  
  
That's a very simplistic example, but you get the idea: on one hand we capture demand from people actively looking for our solutions, and on the other we plant the seeds (like in

> There are some good answers here. I'll weigh in on the pricing of websites and SEO. There are two schools of thought. And typically, if you are paying for a monthly fee, you are still better off than a one-time set it and forget it with the website. The hosting, support, security, etc that comes with monthly is worth it - and you can get SEO bundled in. 

There are a few companies out there that can get real results for around $1k/month - possibly a little higher, but not much. The thing to understand here is they need to be doing actual work - what are the deliverables? The reason so many firms are burned about SEO is that it's easy to say you are "doing work" but not actually doing anything as many attorneys don't know or don't have the time to keep up with it. Companies I'm aware of in these price ranges that we've dealt with include: PaperStreet, Civille, MeanPug. These do have expanded services like link building, etc that are going to exceed the pricepoint above, but if that $1,000-$1,500/mo range is where you want to or need to live, results within 6 months with these real deliverables are possible (within reason). 

If you want to go all-out, while paying a lot more for services, I'd always recommend rankings io. Although, they do charge quite a bit more and largely work with PI firms. But they do a lot and have a pretty good track record. 

But yes, the $2500 and $199 after seems to be a race to the bottom kind of company - and you are going to get what you pay for there.

> Family Lawyer here - our process is as follows: 

Most of our new clients either schedule an intake online through a form on our website or through our answering service (we use LEX Reception currently - I'm not a massive fan though, I wouldn't say I recommend it and we'll probably be moving away from them). We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)

Each of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. 

Then it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. 

At the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. 

Overall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.

Once they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. 

Overall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, bu

> First, you're likely not going to be working for the VC firm AND the companies they invest in, that's a HUGE conflict of interest so I would get some clarity on that.

I used to work in a boutique firm that handled mainly VC financing (on the startup company side) but also did other general lawyer stuff for these startups. To answer your questions directly:

1. You need general transactional experience but mainly finance. Sure there are books out there but you do have to live it as there a lot of moving parts. I can't imagine someone being able to draft and negotiate the finance docs (look at [https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/](https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/) to see what is involved in a single round of financing) for a seed round without seeing it done a few times and being able to dip your toe in here and there. Depending on the startup, there could be a number of different types of contracts that you would need to know your way around (organizational docs, manufacturing agreements, SaaS agreements, indemnification agreements, confidentiality agreements,  and other various service and partnership agreements). Unfortunately your current experience does not translate well (just as I wouldn't know the first thing about criminal or family law, or litigation for that matter).
2. Two books I would recommend to get started in this world are Venture Deals by Brad Feld and A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting, Fifth Edition by Ken Adams.
3. It is workable as a solo but you would likely need some support staff like a paralegal or two. Lot's of docs to draft and process and lots of redlines going back and forth during negotiations.

While possibly less stressful than family and criminal law, it definitely has it's own set of headaches. Tight deadlines, long hours, demanding clients and opposing counsels, and lots of fire drills due to inexperienced and unorganized executives. Responses to emails are expected in minutes and you are absolutely expected to be a master to the point where you have the law and processes memorized ("give me a day to research that for you" does not cut it). These are startups that are hiring you for your expertise to help them navigate the law and don't have time for your inexperience so they will absolutely leave you for someone else that seemingly knows more and responds faster.

Happy to chat more if you have any other questions.

> In my opinion, as a consumer/referral source rather than someone advertising my own services, I would say Free social media and web content is a good investment of your time as you’re starting out.  My family and friends often ask me who I would recommend as a lawyer for whatever their problem is. I’m a sub-specialist, not a general practice lawyer, and their problem will never be my niche area of law. I can’t help them myself, but I still do some research and try to answer their legal questions without giving specific advice. Most of the time, I can find a good answer about what the law says in blogs on a law firm’s website, and one firm usually ends up having lots of good info. When I answer the person’s questions, I send links to the articles or blog posts I find and tell them this firm sounds credible, so call them for help. Works for video content I see on linked in, too. You can build trust with people you never met that way. Lots of lawyers need the services you’re selling, and we always get asked for estate planning referrals. If you can show lawyers that you know what you’re talking about, you could get them as clients as well as referral sources, without even knowing them.

ETA: if you provide enough info that a smart person could answer an easy question without contacting you, then you’ll invite the smart person with a hard question— i.e., the higher paying clients—to contact you.

My Pixel 9 Pro came stock with a Google VPN - apparently I inadvertently enabled it.  Come to find out, Talkatone doesn't play well with VPNs and they'll shut you down if they even suspect that you're using one. Once the VPN was disabled again, Talkatone began working okay and after two days, eventually logged me back in.

In the 10+ years I've been a customer, Talkatone has implemented ***"fair use  limits".*** For as many times as I have inquired, **they continue to refuse to tell me what those limits are.** And, without knowing what those limits are, it makes it very difficult to play by the rules.

I've experienced delayed texts, texts not received and incoming calls that do not ring through but go straight to voicemail. I've experienced a malfunctioning with the app's "answer" button making it impossible to answer a call.  I have a good amount of paid credits but even those don't offer immunity from the ineptitude I've experienced with this service lately.  Talkatone is no longer reliable. I cannot recommend using it as one's main number.

> As a reseller of a UCaaS, all my subscribers have been using the SMS service as P2P and not encountered a problem.  

One of my customers decided to migrate out and later mentioned to me that they had to go through the Campaign Registry for all their numbers, even though it was clearly P2P usage.  This required them to update policies and websites and, had they known about thiis beforehand, they might not have left because the time and financial resources offset the cost savings they had hoped to see.

My friend, a reseller, had a customer send a flyer.  Did everything manually.  This flagged something because that number was not longer allowed to send SMS and had to go through a process to reenable the service which included campaign registry.

I ripped from the FAQ data (provider name redacted) at which I should consider recommending registry and have been told, when in doubt register.

This looks very much like a YMMV topic until everuyone gets the same sheet of music.

Question: What is the default use for X SMS?

Answer:X SMS features, which include the ability to text enabling a main company number (Company Messaging) and text enabling a user’s phone number, is designed and provisioned for Person-to-Person (P2P) messaging, meaning sending/receiving one message at a time with two-way (back and forth) communication between two human users.  This is different than Application-to-Person (A2P)/bulk texting.

Question: What is A2P or Bulk Texting?

Answer: Application-to-Person (A2P)/bulk texting consists mostly of outbound texts where the ratio of inbound messages is lower than 45%. This includes bulk campaign texting, marketing communications, one-way appointment reminders, notifications, etc. Businesses using this A2P/bulk texting are required to register with The Campaign Registry.

Answer: The Campaign Registry is an entity created by mobile network operators to help companies work within regulatory best practices for texting. Campaign Registration is an industry-wide initiative to prevent spam and improve your texting deliverability.  Click [here](https://support.intermedia.com/app/articles/detail/a_id/16843#bulk) for guidelines, information, and options for registering with The Campaign Registry.

> What you are asking for is very simple and easily done. 

The absolutely cheapest way to do this is to purchase something called a "SIP trunk" and run your own "PBX" whether that be a local system or in the cloud. However it is very important you get a qualified person to set it up and maintain it. This could be a higher initial outlay but a cheaper cost over time as you would just have your call and line rental charges for the most part and your maintainers fees, and you can have unlimited staff answering and making calls based on how many "lines" your SIP trunk came with.

The other way to do it is to purchase a managed phone service. This is more expensive over time as you will have a monthly fee per user. The costs are difficult to quantify as it will depend on the package and what exactly comes with it, but generally speaking its more expensive over time than running your own PBX but all the headaches are taken away from you (But they are kind of negated if you have a maintainer so its a juggle). The upsides to managed phone services is they often come with phone hardware as part of the package without having to lay out cash for phones, so you might have the benefit of physical phones at a spread out cost (They aren't free they get priced in over the lifetime of your contract).

We aren't allowed to make recommendations here but if you google "VOIP providers France" or "SIP trunk provider in France" it should get you going in the right direction.

> A few notes: can't make any big changes to the system, can't change provider, and can't spend too much money.

We currently use RingCentral for VOIP. Regular cheap Vtech cordless phone system with one answering machine. We've been dealing with a lot of echo and feedback on calls, or calls just not coming through, and I thought it was the internet service. However, we recently upgraded and have 800/500 service but the echoing is still there and I'm thinking it's the phones themselves.

Lf recommendations on a phone system - one answering machine/two cordless handsets - that are compatible with VOIP and might get rid of the echo and feedback and which are not wifi based - they need to plug into the line the way it's already setup. Need something I can pickup at OfficeMax or order on Amazon. Or, what should I be looking for in the specs?

> That's rough, I'd be annoyed too.  
  
A "SIP client" is basically just an app your mobile phone uses to connect to your VoIP, and it sounds like the one you're using isn't working. It's not uncommon for providers to have their own branded softphone, but if that's the case, you could also consider using a third-party softphone like Bria. It works with most VoIP providers and might solve your issue.  
  
The best next step would be to contact your VoIP provider's support team. They should be able to help you with the correct SIP configuration settings or recommend a specific app that they know works well with their service if they don't offer a native one. If they can't, then it's probably time to explore other options.  
  
I work in the industry and am happy to try and answer more specific questions, if you have any.

### r/VOIP — 2025-06-11 | 1pts | `churn_billing, blocker_trust, pricing` | Mentions: **Vonage**

> Sorry if this it TLTR.

Perhaps I am confused, but the responses appear to be recommending a softphone on your PC instead of a physical phone on your desk.  I don't see how that saves you any money.  You still have to pay for a phone service provider like Vonage, et al.

To answer your original question, yes, you can run a PHONE SERVER on cheap hardware at home. This is simple enough for someone who has been down that road, but darn tricky the first time through.  Issues:  Selecting which freeware software, 3CX, Asterisk and FreeSwitch are big ones.  Then you still have to have a provider who routes the calls to your server. Most of those providers are far cheaper than typical home service like Vonage and some can support going straight to a soft or hard phone. You may lose features like voice mail, you may not.

If you are a web developer type, check out TWILIO.COM - I am very happy there but I have a webserver to handle the custom routing and setup Voice Mail on.  If not, maybe look at VOIP.MS or 1000 others.  
  
If you try to put a "server" in your home without a statis IP address, you will likely have to update every time it changes. A far worse problem is dealing with NAT (network address translation) to your server behind a typical home router.  (NAT is the thing that allows lots of home devices to all share your ONE external IP address).  SIP (voip protocol) to/from a server that is NAT forwarding can be a nightmare resulting in lots of different problems: one way audio, outgoing calls only, no connection at all, everything works until your router's NAT connection times out, then no more inbound calls, calls drop after 5 or 10 minutes, etc. I had a very very bad time fighting NAT over the years. Granted things are much better now and the problem is not bad if the SERVER is not behind NAT and the phones are.

IMHO, you are better off using your time to make money (part time) or looking for a new job.  PM me with your skill set and location? Also, I have used Mint mobile for 3+ years at $15/month and I am completely satisfied.

Other companies sell the VoIP/SIP service by itself, and you can buy a device that will talk to that SIP server.  Usually much cheaper but then its all on you to configure, both the VoIP service as well as the device(s).

> We aren’t allowed to recommend specific service providers but, in general….

Almost any hosted voice service will be able to do what you need.  You want to look for the following when shopping:

1.  Call groups
2.  A smartphone app
3.  Voicemail to email (bonus if they include transcription for no extra charge).

You’ll port or move your number to the new provider.

Set up a call group which will include all four of you.

set the group up to ring the main person who answers most of the calls and then after a number of rings can ring either all the other numbers in the call group or can ring the other phones one at a time.

If no answer from any of the phones, send the call to voicemail.

Set up a group email address that includes all four of you.  Set the phone system to send voicemails to this email address.

All four of you will get an email that has the voicemail attached.

Return the call 🙂

It’ll take a bit to get used to and you might have to play around with the group setup to have a balance between how many rings ou think a caller would tolerate before sending the call to voicemail.

Bonus - some of these services support texting to the same phone number so you could offer a caller with the option to send a text instead of a voicemail.

> VoIP technology really isn’t meant to be used for someone’s primary number and isn’t inherently associated with privacy. If anything, in the sector or general civilian use, they’re often used for scams and companies don’t let you use them for 2FA or MFA most of the time.

If you’re particularly worried about privacy, just use different phone numbers for work and business than you contact friends, family, and personal contacts with.

A sample setup could be something like:

Number 1.) Friends & Family
Number 2.) Work, Colleagues, Networking, and Business Responsibilities 
Number 3.) Personal Business and MFA like banking and securing your social media profiles

In this scenario, numbers 1 and 2 could be VoIP if you want but honestly a regular number is probably easier.

VoIP is often tailored towards business and corporate use which is what causes a lot of VoIP setups to become pretty complex like those used for office phone systems. However, there’s a thriving personal VoIP business in the US with services like TextNow, TextFree, TextMe, and apps like that.

If you want to get started with personal VoIP, I’d recommend getting a [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) number. It’s a FREE VoIP number you can get from Google using a Google Account that you can use for calls and texts via the Google Voice mobile app or at voice.google.com on a computer. The service is actually designed to give you one phone number that “rings across all of your phones.” So during signup, it’ll ask you to verify a real cellular phone number and you can add more as well. The way it works is that if someone calls your Google Voice number, Google Voice in turn calls all the linked phone numbers (like say your cell phone and landline) so that you can answer on whatever phone you’re close to. You don’t need to use it this way, though. Just link your cell number during setup, then delete it in the account settings and download the Google Voice app on your phone. You’ll get a Google Voice number that you can make and receive calls and texts to/from. On the app, make sure you set calls to use data and not cellular (otherwise the app will make you link your real phone number back when you don’t need to). Each Google Account can have one Google Voice number so you can get a second number by using a second Google Account. The only exception to that rule is if you get a new number from Google Voice and then port a second one in, in which case you can keep both on the same Google Voice account.


Apps like TextFree, TextNow, and TextMe work pretty good too but do have a lot of adverts.


Another route is to just get prepaid phone numbers. If your phone is an iPhone XR / XS or newer, it supports dual SIM so you can have one physical SIM card and one eSIM on your phone, both active at the same time with two different phone numbers. If you have an iPhone 13 or later, you can have two eSIMs active at once (instead of 1 pSIM and 1 eSIM), allowing you two phone numbers that way. The be

Each Google Account can have one Google Voice number so you can get a second number by using a second Google Account. The only exception to that rule is if you get a new number from Google Voice and then port a second one in, in which case you can keep both on the same Google Voice account.


Apps like TextFree, TextNow, and TextMe work pretty good too but do have a lot of adverts.


Another route is to just get prepaid phone numbers. If your phone is an iPhone Xr/XS or newer, it supports dual SIM so you can have one physical SIM card and one eSIM on your phone, both active at the same time with two different phone numbers. If you have an iPhone 13 or later, you can have two eSIMs active at once (instead of 1 pSIM and 1 eSIM), allowing you two phone numbers that way. The bene

> No no. Not referring to you in particular, sorry if it seemed that way. Just a comment about the many ways people try to get around the rules, thinking we won't notice.

If someone asks for a product, refer them to the monthly requests thread. There you are more than welcome to say "Yes I use XYZ and find it works well".

I know it's clunky, and it would certainly be more convenient to just drop a review whenever someone asks. Unfortunately when we've tried that in the past, it becomes unreasonably time-consuming to sift through all the "reviews" and other recommendations to see which are legitimate. At that point the sub degenerates into a competition of who can drop a comment the fastest to promote their product, without even answering the original question.

The goal here, really, is to make sure no newbies get taken advantage of by vultures looking to make a quick buck. Someone trying to set up a home VoIP line gets bombarded by ads from companies who will happily take their money but don't actually do what the OP needs them to do. As someone with no experience, it can be hard to figure things like that out.

That's why the sub has the monthly thread. Out here someone can ask specific questions like "I'm considering XYZ for my home VoIP setup. Can they do ABC?" and the replies will be "Yes they can" or "No they can't". We leave no room for "No, but you try our service EFG instead!"

If someone *wants* to be advertised to, they can go to a specific thread that doesn't interfere with the rest of the sub.

Again, I know it's not ideal overall, but please trust us when we say this is the best solution we could come up with. You would probably agree if you could see the shit that the mod queue fills up with.

It seems the rules of this sub say that I can’t recommend products or services so I guess that’s as much as I can offer. Using a local on premise PBX limits the phone lines you can support and so much more. Using land lines or sudo land lines through a cable provider is expensive and limiting. There’s a reason most call center solutions are cloud based these days. The cost and flexibility is far better than anything on premise. Google some of this and see what you come up with. Good luck!

> Greetings! Our team has been screwed over for years and years by Verizon OneTalk. Hard to find the energy and margin to try something new, but we're at wits' end over here and feeling desperate.

For context, we're a small non-profit. We mostly use phone calls for communication, but our main line can also be texted, which functions as a crisis hotline for current or new clients. We have had so so so many issues with OneTalk dropping calls, not loading texts, failing to sync up between devices, connectivity issues of all kinds... over it. And the customer service stinks.

Currently, we have 5 team members with cell phones (each has the OneTalk user app) plus one desk phone. All through Verizon. Not married to these devices or service plan.

Looking for VoIP recommendations that satisfy these needs:

1. Central line that rings on at least 6 phones (whether simultaneously or when not answered by another employee)
2. Text feature is a must. Our current OneTalk number can be texted or called.

Bonus features:

1. Would be dreamy if program could be accessed on a Mac or PC as well (even just the text feature)
2. Has an option to build a virtual receptionist/touch-tone menu/similar

> Question regarding this bit:

> Do not promote or advertise for any business, service or product unless responding to a request in the designated monthly requests post. This includes recommending a user change providers when they have not indicated they are interested in doing so.
This rule does not apply to requests or recommendations for hardware. Recommendations for hardware that is locked to a particular service or provider must include a clear disclaimer of the closed ecosystem (e.g. Ooma, firmware-locked Cisco phones).

> This rule does not apply to requests or recommendations for hardware. Recommendations for hardware that is locked to a particular service or provider must include a clear disclaimer of the closed ecosystem (e.g. Ooma, firmware-locked Cisco phones).

I don't know if this is me reading too much into the rule, but shouldn't an exception also be extended to software where the mechanism of the software itself is the focus?

Lets say I wish to discuss a VOIP application where the name of a company is somewhat embedded in nature of the application.

For arguments sake, lets say I hypothetically wish to discuss game based VOIP clients and their protocols, it's fairly impossible for me to not to mention "TeamSpeak" or "Discord", the companies offering the software.

Also, if someone was to discuss softphones, under the current rules if someone was to ask "Which softphone offers BLF capability?" and you answered "Zoiper does that", have you not just run foul of rule 1 in its current form?

I do believe an exception needs to be made for software discussion and recommendations when the capability and principality of the software is at the heart of the issue.

> Ok in that case, the reason I would recommend hosting (3cx,freepbx or any other flavor of self serve PBX) is for not relying on on-premise hardware/electricity/connectivity for a service that may be critical for business operations.

If you have virtualization environment, UPS and redundant internet on premise, that's different.

And obviously, a self serve PBX is so that you have more control over your choice of provider, and can make any changes you like when you want love you get the gist of how it works.

Now, an open source PBX like FreePBX and Fuzion PBX is great. FreePBX is easy, but also one of the most hacked platform in the world.

But if you need reliable service, it's best to depend on a commercial support like those provided by partners of softwares like 3CX and Yeastar

My recommendation stands, get a provider that can offer support for that DIY PBX of your choice and get help when you need it. If their support is good, then the service will be as well.

While not always definitive or exhaustive of your options, this list will give you a better chance of taking advantage of all integrations that exist between your PM software and the PBX you choose.

Next, you will probably be paying per user/device as that's the business model of most VoIP providers.  You can shop around, but I'd really recommend finding a trusted and preferably local resource to guide you.

Lastly, faxing is very much offered by VoIP companies, in different capacities.  If you have and need a physical fax machine you'll need to get an analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) that will let the fax machine send and receive via the VoIP service.  Your VoIP vendor will be able to answer questions and help.

### r/agency — 2026-01-07 | 2pts | `blocker_tried_rejected`

> For question 1 - copying this answer from another post:

If you're starting out I'd recommend targeting your network first. Go through and find people you know, ex-colleagues, ex-clients etc. and ask for their help. Do some favours for people in return for case studies, referrals etc. You have to be bold and it may be uncomfortable reaching back out to people, but if done properly it should get you to the first stage of revenue growth before you need to do anything else.

Partnerships have always been good to me - find companies or agencies that work with the kind of clients you're targeting, but that don't compete with you, and work out a way where you can benefit each other through referrals or doing joint-projects.

I've seen people build large successful agencies through posting on LinkedIn, but it requires a lot of time and effort to do properly, and it usually only works well when the person is naturally good at (and enjoys) self-promotion. I see a lot of people choosing LinkedIn as their lead gen channel, and it's often because they find it easy to post content rather than get out and network or speak to people. Getting out and speaking to as many people as possible will generate far more leads than posting on LinkedIn in the early days.

I'd also advise setting yourself some targets as making sure you stick to them (non-negotiable). If you want to win 1 new client you may need to send 2 proposals, to send 2 proposals you may need to soeak to 5 people, to speak to 5 people you may need to reach out to 100 people. So if you want to win 1 new client per month, make sure you reach out to 100 people every month without fail.

For question 2 - an agency is a services business which means you'll always have to hire people to deliver work. Hiring and managing people can be challenging but it's not something you can avoid doing if you want to grow an agency. Sounds like you've had a bad experience with hiring in-house so far - I'd think about why it didn't work out and learn from that experience. Were they the right person? Were they properly motiatved? Did they get the support that they needed? Ultimtately as the agency owner it's your responsibility to ensure that the people you hire are successful.

> Really appreciate the honesty and detail in your post - this is something I see a lot with agencies working across different ICPs. I’ve helped agencies and other service businesses tackle this exact split, so I’ll share what’s worked (and what hasn’t) from real projects.

You’re spot on that C-level marketing execs aren’t hanging out on YouTube for tactical “how to” content. They’re more likely to search on Google, skim LinkedIn, or get recommendations in their network. For lead gen in that space, I’ve found YouTube is usually a slow burn unless you’re producing high-level thought leadership or case study content that gets embedded, shared, or referenced elsewhere.

A few practical things to consider:

- YouTube can absolutely build authority and help with SEO, but for C-level direct clients it’s unlikely to be a primary lead source unless you’re investing heavily in strategic, high-quality content (think: roundtables with other execs, sharing original research, or deep dives into industry trends). These videos are more likely to get shared internally or referenced in decision-making, rather than discovered organically.
- For white-label/agency owner leads, if cold email is working and you’ve got the system down, I’d double down there and use YouTube as a content asset to reinforce credibility rather than as a core channel. You could create specific videos that answer common objections, showcase client wins, or explain your process - these can be linked in outbound, on your site, or in proposals.
- If you do go the YouTube route, focus on content you can repurpose. A well-produced client case study, panel discussion, or explainer video can be sliced up for LinkedIn, your website, or email nurture sequences. This approach maximizes ROI and visibility across channels.
- Don’t underestimate the SEO value of video if optimized properly. Even if your C-level prospects aren’t searching YouTube directly, your videos can rank in Google search, especially for branded or high-intent queries.

Personally, as the founder of AI Automation Agent, I’ve seen the best results when video is positioned as a trust-builder and authority play, not as the top-of-funnel channel for executive leads. For agency owners or more “hands-on” ICPs, it can work as a lead driver, but expect a longer ramp-up and more indirect impact for C-level targets.

Happy to dig deeper or share specific examples if helpful - what’s your current split of revenue between white-label and direct clients? That might help decide where to focus your time and content investment.

I'd imagine that these mock ups can definitely be created by AI, maybe a little less perfect than you can make them right now but at a much higher frequency.

I obviously work on automations like that but I actually believe in the product. When you say you reached out to 23 people that really isn't a lot.
Quantity isn't always the answer but in this case you can see that there are gonna be a lot of clients that aren't even looking for the service you are offering.
Spending several hours on these proposals therefore is a big waste of time because the process isn't replicable.

I highly recommend you to implement an Automation and focus on the quality of the AIs output by refining it instead of doing this process over and over again yourself.

I have processes for building backlinks organically and I have a partner that builds high-quality paid backlinks. We only recommend paid backlinks if we're targeting competitive terms and the competitors have an impressive backlink portfolio.

Mostly, it's content and website optimization.

It changes every quarter, based on what's working and what the client's biggest opportunities are. Here's my entire workflow:

ONBOARDING:

\- Kickoff Call

\- Google Drive Folder Creation

\- Create Client Dashboard

\- Determine primary marketing channel



MONTH ONE

\- Finalize common business name

\- Setup Google Search Console

\- Finalize Website (access + basic checks)

\- Discovery Call

\- Identify keywords

\- Setup Google Business Profile

\- Setup Google analytics

\- Fix or schedule fixes for any technical issues on website

\- Finalize Operational Logistics (CRM, contact forms, autoresponders)

\- Submit business to directories

\- Set up social media accounts (Will typically have the client do this)

\- Basic website optimization (meta tags, headings, internal links)

\- Determine review/testimonial acquisition plan

\- Determine photo acquisition plans



RECURRING 90-DAY CYCLE:

\- Perform regular maintenance tasks

\- Perform data analysis

\- Identify best projects for next quarter (using a credit-based system based on the client's budget)

\- Send in-depth report and proposed projects for next quarter

\- Schedule all projects for the quarter

> Great question!

It depends on the maturity of the companies that you want as clients. Do you want to work with "immature" cash-strapped but plentiful startups or "mature" cash-rich but fewer established companies? That's your call. 

Early-stage companies tend to buy based on relationships because they don't know what they don't know. They prefer someone local, someone they know, or someone who comes recommended. That gives them a warm and fuzzy feeling. That’s where local niching works. You’re the “go-to” agency in your area.

As companies grow, they start to value industry expertise. They want an agency that already understands their space. They shouldn't ask you what a conversion is, and you shouldn't have to help them find product/market fit — they already get it. That’s when industry niching makes sense.

Even more mature companies, even those with in-house teams, look for discipline experts. They don’t want a full-service agency. They want someone who does one thing really well—PPC, SEO, email, etc. That’s specialization niching.

The top of the value chain is hyper-niching, when you combine both industry and discipline niching, like PPC for SaaS or email marketing for e-commerce tech. That positioning says, “We do one thing for one type of client, and we’re the best at it.”

Here’s the value chain in order, from lowest to highest, in how much you can charge:

Local niche → Industry niche → Discipline niche → Hyper-niche

You're already heading toward hyper-niching since you’re thinking about digital marketing for e-commerce tech or PPC for SaaS. That’s where the real money is!

I hope that helps answer your question.

Best of luck!

> Here’s a well-crafted response in English, with a popular search keyword as the anchor text linking to your homepage:

Hey! First of all, congrats on launching your SEO agency and specializing in such a well-defined niche like travel businesses. That’s a great start! However, offering a full SEO audit and keyword research for $30 might actually be undervaluing your services. Clients might perceive it as “too good to be true,” which can sometimes hurt credibility.

Instead of lowering your prices further or reconsidering your niche right away, here’s what I’d recommend:
	•	Build a solid case study with one or two initial clients to show measurable results.
	•	Focus on value-driven content marketing to target your ideal audience—blogging, LinkedIn posts, and answering questions in relevant forums can bring leads organically.
	•	Finally, collaborate with professionals in complementary fields like me ([agence seo](https://studiojae.fr/)) to bundle your SEO services with web development solutions and boost your reach.

Don’t be discouraged! The travel industry is competitive, but with a refined strategy and consistent effort, you’ll definitely start seeing better results.

> First of all, if you're new don't start an agency. Start off as a freelancer and as you grow, you can start outsourcing some of the work and hire a team. But that comes later. If you outsource too early, you'll never properly learn the service you're providing and you won't be able to do a very good job. 

I also do email marketing for ecom and I did buy Chase Dimond's course. It's not bad but almost everything he teaches can be found for free online. 

I would recommend you check out Max Sturtevant's YouTube channel and Skool community. He has a great YouTube channel and a low ticket Skool community (I think around $60 if you get all the upsells). You get multiple courses, bi-weekly live call, email reviews whenever needed, and a community of ecommerce email marketers. It is way better and honestly all you need, at least at the start. 

The focus is mostly on email marketing, not so much client acquisition, customer service, etc. But you can ask in the community and you'll still get some answers. 

I usually don't advocate for beginners buying courses but this is one of the rare exceptions I'll make. It's cheap and has more value than courses I've paid hundreds of dollars for.

> How are you typically getting paid? Credit card, ACH/bank transfer, paper checks, or something else? The answer to that question may narrow down or open up what platforms you want to consider.

There's a good chance that you'll run into additional pain points with a more general purpose solution vs a platform that's designed for agencies, especially when it comes to reporting. Accounting numbers are one thing and obviously necessary for books and taxes, but you often need more than just, revenue, P+L, and outstanding balance to understand what's going on with your business.

It's pretty difficult to move between these services, partly for the reason you mentioned (i.e. asking clients to re-enter payment details) as well as the pain that comes with migrating historical data. Your best bet may be to find something that you think will suit your needs and use both Square and whatever you settle on for a while until you're confident that you like the new platform enough to start moving clients over.

Also, I'd recommend you take a look the reviews on [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com) when vetting a new platform. They seem to have the most genuine reviews when it comes to this category of products.

Got two appointments and some ppl told me they want to know more and to send them something but i didn’t have a process for that a this time and assumed it was a trick to avoid saying no and saying yes. 

But it’s a number and a luck thing, you have to get the right person on the phone, that is available when you call, that is interested in your service when you call. (for example if i sell web design, then usually the person needs to already have thought abt it before you call) 

I think experimented ppl are way more at their ease when it come to convince to get that first meeting even if the client was not interested yet. 

Also you need to work a lot beforehand making sure you call the right person, that you think will be a fit, so you don’t lose their time and yours 

It’s a luck (luck comes from hard work), experience, patience and number thing. 

But i would defo recommend to do it bc you learn so much about selling when you do it; its a skill that has no price. Yes it works but its priceful since you ego, confidence get hurt in the process but when they say yes then you forget about all of this 

Good luck with your journey !

> I'm going to file this advice under "tough love".

It sounds like you're starting an agency for all the wrong reasons. It sounds like you're starting on because some guy on YouTube told you it's a good way to make extra money.

If that's not the case -- sorry for making the assumption.

I came to this conclusion because it seems like you only know what the videos told you rather than actually diving in and getting a real understanding of what it is you're doing because you actually like the service you're delivering rather than the idea of the outcome.

&#x200B;

But I will answer all of your questions anyways:

1. What Niche should I be targeting?
   1. Whatever niche you want. The niche should be specific to you and something you enjoy. You need to become an expert in your niche if you actually want to grow and retain clients long term and build authority. Don't be in a niche you hate.
2. What should be my offer?
   1. Whatever it is you're selling. I hate this idea that gurus preach that everyone has to have an "offer" that's enticing. Does what you sell offer value on its own? Then that's the offer. If it doesn't, then maybe what you sell isn't something people want.
   2. Also, you addressed this later on when you said you'd be willing to work for free to gain experience. That's an offer...
3. You need the following things in my opinion (Episode 1 of our podcast also covers all of this):
   1. Website (or landing page). You can build a simple one on Wix. My vote is always WordPress but it has a pretty hefty learning curve if you're new.
      1. This includes a domain, CMS, and hosting provider. You can technically get all three from Wix. I don't recommend it later on down the road, but that's the easiest and most affordable solution right now for you.
   2. A way to collect payments. I vote Stripe.
   3. A separate bank account from your person bank account. Keep the money separate.
   4. If you're in the US, that's all you need. You can operate as a sole prop without registering an LLC. However, I still recommend resisting as an LLC to protect your personal assets in case someone decides to come after you for whatever reason. You can use a service like Legal Zoom to do that.
4. How can I convince someone to use me?
   1. Just be honest. Don't lie about your experience. Tell them you're starting an agency around a specific service you offer and you'd like to work for them for free, a discounted rate, or a pay per performance model. Everyone starts somewhere and when you're working with actual business owners, they know that. When you offer this, you'll attract smaller business owners who can't afford actual lead gen agencies. As you start charging for your services, your types of clients will change. So just be aware of that.

&#x200B;

Addressing your other questions:

1. How should I structure my day right now?
   1. By building your brand. Build your website. Find forums, publications, podcasts, Youtube channels, etc that your niche foll

> 1. Don’t start an agency, get your brother to start freelancing first. I recommend he get started on Upwork. Outside of Upwork you need to convince people they need the service AND that you’re a good choice for the job. Inside people are already looking for what you offer.

2. Build a portfolio of 3 sites before he starts freelancing. He can work for very cheap for your network — family, friends, local businesses you may know. And of course, build your agency website and make sure it’s a jewel first.

3. Once both you and him have solid case studies and experience, then move outside of Upwork and begin looking for work. I recommend LinkedIn as the best way to get your clients by building a personal brand and authority there. Have a look at Niall Ratcliffe and his brother there, they’ve built an agency from scratch with this strategy.

To answer your question, about how I started:

- I worked as a freelance direct response copywriter on forums, and then freelance networks like eLance and oDesk at the time.
- I kept moving up to bigger and bigger clients.
- At one point I finished the copy for a funnel and the client told me they don’t have a team available atm to implement it. They told me they’ll pay me whatever money I need, but I should get the team together and execute. That’s how I started my first agency 😅

### r/agency — 2024-01-02 | 24pts | `pricing`

> What’s wrong with your current pricing, package and offer? You should be adjusting based on market feedback. 

If you lose a client for example, or a client doesn’t get results, figure out why. What could you have added to the service? What could you have taken away? What was missing that could have delivered the results? 

Even if they get good results, ask yourself what you could add to make the results even better.

Also get very clear on the result you’re trying to deliver, and assess how each component of your package contributes to it or doesn’t. Maybe you notice that 90% of your clients get 80%+ of leads from ads and landing pages, not SEO. It may be time to drop SEO, and get rid of all those writers draining your margin.

So there’s nothing in particular I recommend you read — my recommendation is that you spend time thinking about it with your own mind, rather than looking for a ready-made answer. You’ll make progress much faster.

In terms of marketing books everyone should read; Gary Halbert’s Boron Letters, Jack Trout & Al Ries’s Positioning and Donald Miller’s Building a Story Brand are imo must-reads. There are other ones, but not as game-changing as these 3.

> Hey! Just wanted to say that the agency model is very hard. Don't get discouraged and keep trying new things. Here are some ideas that can potentially help you out:

1. I would like to begin this list by mentioning an important point. When you start a service-based business, it typically means that you have mastered a craft and have reached a stage where you can provide real value to other people who are looking for that skill. In the beginning, I recommend solely focusing on the abilities that make YOU unique. For example, in my own case, I started helping people with designing their websites even though my main true skill was software engineering. This was really because I was prioritizing immediate cash flow rather than a long-term vision. 
2. Once you have niched down your services, it's now time to figure out who your ideal customers are. I will be writing a detailed post on how I did this for my consulting business but here's a quick summary:
   1. Reverse engineer your customer.
   2. Assume that you are someone who has recently purchased your services and answer the following questions: who am I? when did I buy? why did I buy? what exactly did I buy?
   3. Go into as much detail when answering these questions. You will thank me later.
   4. After doing so, you will be able to see a few potential avatars for your business. Pick the one that feels the best to you and whom you're confident servicing. 
3. Once you have determined your ICP, it's time to implement your marketing channels. This will be highly custom for your business so I won't go into exact details but there are typically 4 main avenues of customer acquisition:
   1. Warm outreach: message people that you know. start an actual conversation. ask them if they know anyone who is interested in your services. DO NOT ask them if they want to buy.
   2. Cold outreach: message people that you don't know. I recommend looking into [instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai). Their free training program is amazing for this.
   3. Content: This is what I'm personally spending a lot of time on these days. creating an online brand is definitely worth the effort. Give without asking and you will reap the rewards.
   4. Paid ads: Google Ads. Meta Ads, etc. I also recommend going with more niche avenues. For example, if you are building a product and have the budget, pay IndieHackers to feature them in their weekly newsletter!
4. Some bonus channels:
   1. Referrals: message your previous customers and ask who in their contacts is a great potential customer (like them) for your services. You can further increase the chance of closing this lead by providing a personalized coupon with an expiration.
   2. Partner with other agencies and affiliates. For example, if you offer web design services, team up with marketing agencies!

Hope this helps!

> I run a similar business except we focus seller leads for real estate investments. Its essential for us to keep track of conversions in order to improve our marketing effort. At the end of the day we don't sell leads we sell results and making sure that we have a cohesive relationship between marketing and sales is a big part of what we do. At the end of the day  our clients prefer that we keep them on track to improve their performance and our performance. Any leads that are not ready to convert we plug them into the appropriate lead nurturing work flow until they are ready to convert. We essentially have to keep close tabs on our clients leads and make sure they are not missing appointment or that they ar not following up. Everyone takes accountability. We also have our analytics integrated for offline conversions. We also keep track of phone recordings to see what's goin on. Your client has no benefit in lying to you or misleading you. I recommend you have them pay upfront for your services. I hope that answers your question. Were very neurotic with the way we operate, and that's what the profession needs. You need to be the best because any small improvements in your system result in multiple hundred of thousands of dollars if not millions. Anyways hope that helps. Good Luck!

### r/agency — 2023-06-17 | 3pts | `pricing`

> I'm not saying it's your main issue, but: in many of these cases, resonance is low because relevance is low.

Your entire positioning - the folks you target, the pitch you send them, the service you offer, and so on - must be issue-centric, outcome led, and highly specific in both 1) who you serve and 2) how you serve.

Relevance is a function of specificity - and, sorry, but: neither "analytics" nor "startups" are specific categories.

If you're keeping things generic (not saying you are, I'm merely presuming), all you're doing is selling your capability ("hey, do you like analytics? I do analytics! Hey!") to people who, in 95 percent of the cases, won't even know why they might need analytics right now, and spend 0.2 percent of their week thinking about data and stuff, if that. A generic, non-specific solicitation means you put the onus of figuring out what you could do for them ON THEM - and now more than ever, the result of this is almost always... crickets.

Hence, my recommendation: really focus in on a specific segment (e.g., "SaaS Start-ups seeking their C-round in these very difficult times," "HR leaders tasked with reducing churn," etc.), and the research and identify the business's pain (!) you can solve for them.

Then, speak directly to their issue, pitching a solution (different from a capability!).

This is particularly important in your case, because not many orgs have functions which have 'analytics' in their  job description; it's something a lot of the people might need at very few times (and those who do have 'analytics' teams aren't necessarily your ideal clients, because all they'll do is hire you as staff aug, at shitty rates, IF that).

So, very few people go into the office in the mornings thinking "I need some analytics." Lots of people need better forecasts though, HR insights, improved inventory management, or much more helpful answers to "WTF works in marketing and what doesn't?" (I made these up).

Which is why you'll have to identify and put forth a solution for resolving a business issue (bonus points if it's an issue that firmly "sits" in a function/is owned by somebody with targets and a budget: Finance, HR, Supply Chain, Marketing [and the groups within these... No need to market to the CFO if you can serve the junior treasurer and be profitable!]).

So, again try to specify your "who" and "what" until it's ridiculously narrow, then try again.

Oh, and: if you can, specify an outcome, too (difficult when you start out, I know) - "I increase forecast accuracy by x," "I typically find y savings opportunities in an average trucking start parts supply chain, which usually unlock mid-six figures in cost reductions"... Things of this nature). 

If you get this right, you'll be able to write super-short emails that really resonate. Think: "Hey, elrooto, need to get your forecasts in shape before your next investor pitch meeting? I increase forecast accuracy by x percent using y, and give clients their results in IB-gra

### r/agency — 2023-03-27 | 5pts | `positive`

> We do have a set process for onboarding of all new staff. 

In their first week, we cover topics like:
* Agency Induction - what our agency is, our values, org structure, products, services, process, position, ideal client, etc. 
* Agency strategy - what the agency is currently aiming to achieve in the current financial year and our medium term vision. 
* Department &amp; job induction - for each new employee to know what their departments structure, capabilities, and responsibilities are 
* HR induction - to cover the agency benefits, leave policy/process, pay, training, team principles, etc. 

The above is done either via confluence (documentation and guides); presentation decks (agency strategy/vision); and PDF handbooks (team/department guides and HR)

Separately we select a “buddy” to pair with the new hire. The buddy is ideally a medium to long term standing staff who can help the new hire (aside from the hire’s immediate manager) for any support or guidance. 

We use BambooHR to help build a checklist of all the things a new employee needs to have/know - and it automatically assigns a bunch of tasks to the manager, buddy, HR, IT etc. 

If they are going to be assigned to an existing platform/project, then they are given time to review all the notes, guides, and documentation about that project. For larger projects of clients we have had for a number of years, we have built a little quiz (10-20 questions) that they have to answer after they’ve read about the platform. 

In a similar vein, we also have off boarding processes (also managed in BambooHR) to collect feedback, turn off access, etc. when someone leaves. 

After 2-3 weeks of starting, each new hire fills a feedback form to assess their onboarding experience with the agency. We found that hires who rated the onboarding experience more positively, performed better and stayed with the agency longer. So for us, it’s a crucial step. 

The above is primarily done for full time staff - rather than contractors (though for contractors they do review the project docs and any associated quizzes for their assigned work). 

Apologies that I can’t share any specific examples, as a lot of it is IP we’ve created about our agency and strategic vision which is intertwined in our write ups. It gets reviewed each year. 

Hope it helps, and I can highly recommend building your onboarding process out as I it directly relates to staff retention. But don’t forget to continually iterate your onboarding processes based on staff feedback. Good luck!

I started my consultancy firm within a year of leaving university and without the advantages of your internships. The critical thing though is you're able to offering something unique (beyond just charging less). 

I've shared this advice a lot on this Reddit recently, but feels appropriate here too. 

​ Let met know if this helps.

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. [I wrote a lot about this here](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).
2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with.

Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.
3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. [Make it a habit to set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have. Follow up on these calls too.
4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.
5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. This gives you a level of portability you don’t get with YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other channels.
6. **Create a strong website experience**. Make sure you [develop a website which will give your audience what they really need](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-develop-a-better-website-for). Post your best content on it.

> Imagine if a client came to you and said they had "zero budget" but wanted to attract business. It's not impossible, but it makes things a little trickier. Like most things, the more you can invest the better the results you will have. So I'd set aside a little budget for this. 

I'd be mindful that if you want a book to attract more than the average number of sales (300 copies) you need to build a large following. At the beginning you're going to be scrapping your way to the first few hundred followers - but overtime people will naturally come to you.

> As a lot of people have mentioned already, this isn't a good idea.

Imagine if a stranger approached you on the street to offer consulting services? It doesn't work. There's no reason for anyone to trust you.

The problem is there's too many people doing it and trust is at an all time low. 

I'd suggest a combination of the following which has worked a lot better in the past. 

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. I wrote a lot about this here: [https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).
2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with. [Here are six options](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-method) \- just pick one for now - the ones that feel best suited to you. Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.
3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. Make it a habit to [set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have.
4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.
5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. If possible, create your own index here which ranks organisations in your field by their success in your topic. 
6. **Create a strong website experience**. Have a [great website experience](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-develop-a-better-website-for). Post your best content on it. Make sure it includes case studies and testimonials. Make it a place for people to visit and explore your philosophy and successes.

There are a lot of great resources out there too. Learn from the top consultancy blogs and advice shared on the web. Hope this helps.More info here: [https://richardmillington.substack.com/](https://richardmillington.substack.com/)

> There are plenty of things to 'stay away from'. But we can only talk about them in a general sense (e.g. clients with low budgets, online charlatans, suspect vendors etc...). I'd also advise avoiding hourly rates too. 

The service, service types, and structure templates are a great place to start. But the hardest challenge for most new consultants is attracting clients. If you don't have a large base of connections you can start with, it can be tricky.

Having social media accounts is fine, but social media doesn't give you the reach it used to. It's very easy to spend a lot of time working hard on social media accounts which don't go anywhere.

So I'd suggest the following: 

1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience.

### r/consulting — 2023-05-16 | 2pts | `blocker_trust`

> A few thoughts for you:

You may or may not be right that your lack of staffing is caused by your ND disclosure. I’m going to try to frame out why and provide recommendations for you. 

Why they may hesitate to staff someone who is ND:
1) Individual bias
2) Corporate bias - D&I initiatives may be a facade 
3) New hires are always a risk, and they’ve chalked this into an increased risk bucket
4) Consulting is a client service business and some of the challenges of ND folks make it harder to succeed in that set-up
5) They are honestly trying to match you to the best project based on the supports you asked for and it hasn’t come up yet. 

It also just might be that there isn’t enough work. 

Note that these are a mix of bad and good reasons.  For your immediate best path it probably doesn’t matter which is why. Longer term it might - if it’s bias driven you may never be able to change that false impression of lack of capability. 

So what do you do. I would sidestep the issue, unless they force you to address it. I would keep doing great work. I would explicitly ask for project work. I would ask for feedback on the work you are doing. You want to make it clear that staffing you on a project will be a win for that project. If you get answers about project availability, I would acknowledge that and then ask what you can do? Can you help with more client development. Is there anything you can focus on learning to set yourself up for success? Generally give off the vibe of someone who is ready and capable of more. 

In the future, I think you can accomplish almost all of the goals of disclosing your neurodiversity without actually making the disclosure. Frame it as “things that help me work best”.  Many companies use things like Myers Briggs which mostly just facilitate conversations about working styles. So you can come across as just really self aware if you raise certain things. “I tend to get really focused on getting all the details, so I may ask you explicitly how long you want me to work on things.” “I tend to do best with clear plans, is it OK if I take some time to lay this out and make sure I’m not missing anything.”  As you build relationships you can make more pointed disclosures “Hey, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, just so you know I’ve learned my failure mode is to put my head down and try to do everything when I have to much.  If you see me doing that I’d appreciate the heads up, I may need help thinking through prioritization.”  Start small and build up to more “risky” disclosures once you’ve built up a relationship and a well of goodwill.

> Well, first of all, I think you should be able to define your scope and services first. Make sure that you have the proper and right objectives at the start to make sure that you deliver on what the client is actually paying you to deliver on. It's so easy to go off on all tangents especially when you feel like you're seeing a lot of problems popping up.

Next, once you're sure about your objectives, clearly explain and work with the client on the standards you'll be using to provide your recommendations. Are they expecting you to provide the expert opinion? Are they expecting you to incorporate their employees' opinions? Are they expecting you to find the compromise in between? Answering this would help you to also come up with your approach on whether you will continue to ask their employees for their approach or not. Bear in mind, they have been working at the company as well and may be seeing things you're not or are just not able to explain to you why they do things the way they do.

Lastly, telling your client's personnel that their ideas are dumb to their face is a surefire way not to get future jobs so use that sparingly.

> So…before answering this question, I think it would be good to segment the different types of consultants. This sub is primarily focused on consultants who work for large, established firms such as McKinsey or Deloitte. Most people at these firms joined through established recruiting pipelines at an undergraduate or graduate level school. It is possible to join these firms from industry, but the path in is a bit less clear. 

And then there are tons of other, smaller more niche consulting firms that deliver a wide variety of services. These firms are probably mostly made up of industry veterans who for some reason wanted to provide their services to a range of client companies rather than work for one company.

If you want to enter consulting, I’d recommend just googling whatever industry you’re in and then add “consulting” to the end of your search query. Then look at the firms that pop up, check out the bios of their employees, and see if you have any common experience or traits. 

Without knowing your education or experience it’s tough to say what type of consulting you’d want to do, or if you’d make a good candidate for a consulting job.

Short version - it's super specific to your organization and the other party. There is no single answer for this. 

I recommend having a conversation with your manager if you have a level of trust with them. While not encouraged, if one of my team was looking to go to a client, I wouldn't stop it. I would see them as a potential buyer if I play my cards right. Also, helping people achieve career goals or moves is just good karma.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-07-07 | 2pts | `general` | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

> Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.

From what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.

A few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.

One thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.

Also, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.

The intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.

Good luck with the new practice!

> Congrats on going solo! Smart move thinking about foundational tech early—makes scaling way easier later.

For personal injury, I’d focus on:

1. **Case Management** – Tools like Clio or Filevine are solid and scale well as your caseload grows.
2. **CRM System** – HubSpot’s free tier is decent to track leads and client touchpoints.
3. **Phone System** – Get something that can handle multiple lines and voicemail transcription. Once marketing kicks in, the call volume can surprise you.

One thing a lot of solo PI attorneys overlook is **how to handle all the inbound calls**, especially after hours or when you’re in court. Missing even one can mean losing a solid case. Some folks use virtual receptionists or call-handling tools that can answer, qualify, and even book consults automatically—way cheaper than hiring full-time staff, and it helps you stay responsive.

The “5-minute rule” in PI is real—if you don’t respond fast, potential clients just move on to the next name on Google.

Also, **set up your accounting system** early. QuickBooks plays nice with most legal tools, and it’ll save you serious time (and headaches) come tax season.

Best of luck with the launch—solid foundation now pays off huge later.

If you outsource, you end up paying $5 per hour (long term) or more than $1 per \*minute\* (on demand). But it's hard to get them to your backoffice systems -- CRM, scheduling system.

AI agents on the other hand can also be expensive (ChatGPT Realtime API) or cheap (12 cents per minute, much lower than human). You basically end up having to do some training on somebody -- either human or AI -- to make it really work for you.

The best lever is sequencing. Your outreach should drive to “reply with two details” rather than “book a call.” Then you send a tailored Loom once they’ve self qualified. Then the booking link. That way the calendar is the reward for fit, not the default action.

  
If you do hire a caller, pay them on qualified meetings held, not meetings booked, and record everything. One week of call recordings will tell you whether they’re building pipeline or torching your brand.What are you selling, what’s the price point, and do you have any proof asset you can send in place of a live pitch during business hours?

\- Inbound AI Voice Agents (best for high-ticket businesses with high call volume, ie. Dental Offices, HVAC, Plumbing, etc.)  These are often used as overflow handling, so conditional forwarding from their line if a call is going to be missed (receptionist is busy, on another call, or it's after hours)  
\- Proposal and document automation (Branded templates with dynamic variables that are generated automatically following a virtual meeting, transcript is sent to an agent that plots into the dynamic variables, then sends the draft to a human for review/final editing)  
\- Blog automation/SEO/AEO - every business should have a blog, ours runs twice weekly automatically, one that hits trending keywords in our niche, the other that hits keywords we consistently want to rank on (took us to #1/#2 based on the terms in our market within 2 weeks) - it is very high quality, and hits all of the metrics that google looks for (internal/external linking, ranks us in LLMs, has a table of contents, has an estimated read length, and much more)

Tons of custom GPT's where we can just share links to for our clients and they can use.  These are super fast and cheap for our clients, we often just hand them out to bring leads in for larger projects once they see the value a simple GPT can bring.

> Hi there! Just a quick note upfront - I'm with LEX Reception, but I promise to keep this purely informational.  
  
When evaluating answering services, here are a few things to consider, no matter which provider you choose:  
  
Legal-Specific Intake - The person answering your calls should be familiar with legal terminology and processes to ensure smooth communication with your clients.  
  
Real People - Check if the service provides real people or AI receptionist. I'm biased on this one because we truly believe a real person answering a call provides a better first impression than AI (we have data to prove it!).  
  
Integrations That Work For You - Look for services that allow direct scheduling. This eliminates frustrating back-and-forth - securing a higher commitment from the potential new client. Integration with your CRM or case management system also cuts down on admin.  
  
Overflow and Routing - The provider should offer flexible routing options and help you with best practices that align with your firm's protocols. Check that they make it easy to toggle availability as your schedule changes between meetings or deep focus work.    
  
Tone Consistency- Callers should always feel like they’re speaking to your practice. The answering service should provide a custom script to maintain consistency and offer expertise in helping to craft it.  
  
Hope that helps! More than happy to talk through in more detail.

Last month, a client called during a board presentation asking about our API timeline. Instead of voicemail, the AI answered using the project docs I'd uploaded - gave him actual dates and technical details. 

The difference is it's not just a message-taker. It knows your business inside out. When clients ask "This is Bob, can you put me through to Bill?" or "Do you handle X?", they get real answers immediately.

You're absolutely right about calling back quickly though. I get alerts for priority clients and return calls within 30 minutes. The AI just handles the immediate questions while I'm genuinely unavailable.

> Just adding to the mix from the Moneypenny side - we get why so many firms are cautious. The person who answers your phone *is* the first impression, and if they can’t capture details correctly or make the caller feel heard, it can hurt your firm’s reputation. That’s why a lot of law firms use us for specific scenarios like:

* **After hours** so they can genuinely be “open 24/7” without staff burnout
* **Overflow cover** when multiple lines are busy
* **Legal intake** so new leads are qualified and prioritized before you call back

Some want simple message taking, others have us follow detailed scripts, route urgent calls, or book new clients straight into their calendar. All our receptionists handling legal calls are trained on intake etiquette, legal terminology, and when *not* to filter out a potential client unless you’ve told us to.

From what we’ve seen, the biggest frustrations firms have with other services are:

* Agents making judgment calls about who to put through (and losing good leads)
* Long call delays or poor audio quality that frustrates callers
* Generic scripting that doesn’t reflect how your firm works
* Pricing structures that punish you for short calls

Our plans start from smaller minute bundles for firms just covering after hours up to fully tailored setups. It’s not one size fits all. If you’re weighing options, look for a provider that: 1. Lets you control call handling rules in detail, 2. Has experience with legal intake, and 3. Doesn’t make callers feel like they’ve hit a wall.

Happy to answer questions or share what’s worked for other firms, even if you go with someone else.

[Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) can definitely do that and they're very good. It's expensive though. [Upfirst](https://upfirst.ai/) is 1/10th of the price and does the same thing. (Disclaimer: I work there and it's definitely not ideal for everything. If you want a full virtual assistant to handling scheduling, it's not right for you. But it definitely gets the job for message taking.)

Don't get me wrong, Ruby is solid. I have had colleagues that were very happy with their service. However, their focus wasn't on deep personalization. For a law firm, where building trust is key, that might matter more than in other industries.

There are smaller companies, like Starry Solutions (who I use now) that provide that hyper-personalized service. They took the time to learn the nuances of my practice and my clientele.

Also, Starry Solutions was significantly cheaper than Ruby. They just don't have the brand-name recognition or the amount of resources that Ruby does.

When I bought my car, I actually had it shipped across country.  I placed my info in "instant quote" web page and was amazed at the number of calls I got from salespeople trying to quote me a price to ship my car over.

Soooooo....I hung up my call with my yelp guy....put all of his info in the quote web page, told them that I wanted to transport two cars from Florida to Wahshington within two weeks.....I can only assume the yelp salesman's phone was lit up for a week....I never heard back from him. 

To OP, the problem is that half the time, you guys lie to get around the receptionist and then we are on deadlines, and you are cold calling us. It is infuriating.

> Based on other comments in this thread that I agree with, there's another human factor I'd like to add. 

They just don't care. 

In order for a law firm to actually care about this, they need to see through the technological lenses that show value. 

I doubt many law firms even try to measure or quantify the value legal tech products even bring, maybe the innovation team does some kpi analysis but no one measures the *actual* result or value from a product. The day law firms start measuring the value return of a product or service is the day Harvey goes bankrupt. 

There's even a unofficial saying among legal tech founders that once you win a single law firm, you can almost win all others. This is because when purchasing the product, the law firm industry is far more relationship based than merit based based.

It's very much stuck in a limbo of any product being assessed as "other big law firms are using it so should I" or "my client finds this fancy so I must get this tech to show everyone we're tech forward".

One might question "why can't IT initiate this approach?" and as someone who's done a deep dive on why IT doesn't partake in this area, it's because law firm IT teams are overworked to death with their own responsibilities, they'd rather not deal with new creative ideas that can end their careers if something goes wrong and they get blamed for it.

As for your suggestion on why not get an agency for doing such work for the law firm, it's been answered before in this subreddit that it's an absolute pain and restrictive for the people who have tried setting up private cloud premise solutions collaborating with IT.

In the end, you need to ask yourself why go through this hassle for a firm that only cares about the final result, not the "process" or "cost savings" or "maintenance work". If you do miraculously find a firm who's willing to work with you, the associated cost and work you need to put up with a dinosaur firm far outweighs the return on value you get from it as well. Legal tech just isn't big enough to make that kind of money.

Rarely will a couple days be enough time for me to realistically evaluate what you're selling, so be prepared to adjust the trial period. Likewise, don't tell me that the price is only available if I commit right away -- if you're selling me something that is going to cost me thousands of dollars over a lifetime, I need to take my time, and as a solo, I don't have time to spend hours at a time making a decision right away.  A little while back, I was evaluating an answering service, and they tried to give me the limited-time offer pitch when I asked for just a couple of extra days to decide.  Needless to say, I declined to consider them after that.

Having a piece of software that correctly creates a chain of custody chart - and identifies potential gaps - based on the evidence would be helpful. Creating these charts in large investigation is tedious work. I could see a low cost ai solution that does this 1 single task well being a hit among defence lawyers and maybe potentially government prosecution services.

> Saying RAG is useless in litigation is like saying keyword search is useless in disclosure. Litigation isn’t about neatly reading one document front to back, it is about dealing with bundles of pleadings, witness statements, precedents and years of correspondence. No LLM can realistically just read everything without retrieval. Even with big context windows you are not fitting an entire disclosure set or case history in one go.



"Vectors pretending to be understanding" misses the point. Embeddings are what make semantic search work. That is what lets you find termination when the document says rescission or employment agreement when it says service contract. It is not a trick, it is how you avoid brittle keyword matching. Modern stacks use hybrid approaches that combine dense and sparse retrieval with rerankers to make results far more reliable than the strawman you are criticising.



The blindfold analogy is back to front. RAG is what grounds the model in the actual record. If your system brings back different results each time and misses key passages then your pipeline is badly engineered. Fixed chunking, consistent top-k, rerankers and audit trails are all standard ways to make retrieval stable and repeatable.



The idea that an LLM can "just read the text directly" also does not hold up. Context windows have limits. Even at 1,000,000 tokens you cannot brute force a litigation dataset. Without retrieval the model has no way of knowing what matters and what does not.



On the point about waiting a few hours for an answer, that is not how litigation teams work. They need iterative passes: first a chronology, then cross-checking witness statements, then building out issue lists. Speed and cost do matter, because lawyers are not going to sit around waiting overnight for each run.



The real challenge in litigation AI is governance. Can you show what was retrieved, explain why it was retrieved, and defend it in court? Retrieval actually makes that easier because you can inspect and log the passages that shaped the answer. Pure read everything approaches turn into a black box with no audit trail.



So the issue is not that RAG is useless. It is that your badly designed RAG is useless. Throwing out the whole approach ignores the realities of both the technology and litigation practice.

The NY Times suit does not affect ZDR users. From [https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/](https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/) \-  
  
**What if I am a business customer and I have a Zero Data Retention agreement?**

* You are not impacted. If you are a business customer that uses our Zero Data Retention (ZDR) API, we never retain the prompts you send or the answers we return. Because it is not stored, this court order doesn’t affect that data.

Technically there is no reason why an LLM provider cannot maintain data security and privacy. Like any business relationship, it comes down to whether you trust the vendor. We trust OpenAI to maintain data privacy out of their own self-interest. We also utilize other LLM providers, including the some of the cloud providers you mention, to maintain vendor diversification and LLM specialization. 

We are early in this technology cycle, and people fear change. At the same point in the cloud services technology cycle, people argued that giving your data to cloud providers was crazy. But in the long term the lowest cost and highest value services will become the norm. Unless you are a very large firm with very significant risk, it's unlikely that commercializing locally hosted LLMs will be the answer.

> Sorry this happened to you.  Unfortunately this is always a risk when someone shares their ideas while selling a service or interviewing.  You have to have a line in mind that you are not willing to cross when answering questions for free.  In other words, when will you simply walk away.

While signing an agreement (about ownership, not using your ideas etc.) may help, the reality is it costs money to enforce an agreement.  Worse, a court may value your idea for an amount that is less your' attorney's fees which would easily be $25K-$100,000.

I advise vendor clients to strike an agreement for a price that (1) their customer pays a chunk upfront thereafter at regular intervals and for the vendor to agree to a contract period that is shorter than the vendor would like but can live with e.g. 6 months, 9 months whatever etc and perhaps limits the scope of work the vendor originally had in mind (so as to limit potentially costly deliverables). You get the idea. All of this is put in the contract.

 While its less than ideal, the vendor client gets some money, improves the product on a real customer,  receives IP protection in writing (enforceability could still be an issue) and simultaneously seek additional customers. 

Your story is a great reminder to ALL of us about the delicate balance between (1) demonstrating one's competence to get hired and (2) being taken for a ride.

Ultimately, I decided to return every single penny since I was the poc , which meant I bore the entire cost out of my own pocket.
Now, I’ve built a team of two. My co-founder is strong in digital marketing, and we’ve decided to focus on helping small businesses scale, with a service priced at $600.  we are confident in our product this time unlike last time.

2. I’ve read your answers and they’re genuinely excellent-  how can I build and maintain a strong pipeline?

> facebook can work for agency client-gen, but only if you add friction and treat it like outbound at scale.

benchmarks i’ve seen (US, broad B2B services):

\-   CPL: $25–$100+ (trade/local niches often at the low end, "sell to marketers" at the high end)

\-   form -> booked call: 10–25% if you qualify; <10% if you don’t

\-   show rate: 50–70% with SMS reminders + calendar holds

what helps quality:

\-  ditch simple lead forms. send to a landing page with a 6–8 question filter (budget, role, timeline). require calendar booking on submit.

\-   auto-qualify: disqualify gmail domains, tiny headcount, or "just exploring" answers.

\-   optimize for Completed Registration or Schedule with CAPI + offline conversions, not cheap Lead form fills.

\-   retarget anyone who watched 50%+ of your hook video, site visitors, and engagers. that’s where booked-call CPA gets sane.

\-   creative: 30–45s UGC-style ad that states niche + painful before/after + 1 quick proof. rotate weekly.

if you’re selling to DTC brands, keeping creative fresh is the unlock. i’ve had good results leaning on [Needle](https://www.askneedle.com/) for rapid ad and email variants (48-hour turnarounds, you still approve everything, and it’s \~a third of typical agency cost). basically an AI-powered creative engine that learns from performance and ships weekly.

1. I send them a DM or an email with something like this: 

*Hey \[First Name\],*

*Most business owners don’t know this, but chatbots are saving companies $300K+/year in support and sales costs.*

*I went ahead and built a starter chatbot for \[Business Name\], just using public info from your site - it’s already answering FAQs and capturing leads.*

*Want me to show you how it works (and what it could be saving you)?*

*Quick 10-min call - promise it’ll be worth your time.*

  
2. When they actually book a call, I enter their website URL into [noem.ai](http://noem.ai) and customize a very basic support Ai agent for them

3. on the call, I use Noem's chrome extension to show them what it'll look like on their own website, how it solves their customer's problems, how it upsells their Shopify products... and answer any questions they have

4. it usually ends with - can you finish building this for me?

5. Based on what they want I decide whether to do it myself and keep 100% profit (usually around $3000+hosting fees) or pay noem $250, have them build it and keep the difference.

> Hi everyone, I’m 18 and currently in 12th grade, but I’ve been building an agency idea around AI voice agents and chatbots for service businesses. I need some blunt, real-world feedback from people who have actually run Global agencies from India and understand client acquisition, retention, and taxes. The service part of my business is mainly automated because once the agent is set up, it doesn't need to give constant efforts, so the business model is more focused on sales only.

Here’s my current model:

We provide AI voice agents and chatbots that handle incoming calls, answer queries, schedule appointments, and capture leads.

Pricing: ₹12,900/month (~$149)+(Additional Credits)for voice agents and ₹8,600/month (~$99)+(Additional Credits) for chatbots.

Client distribution: about 60% choose voice agents, 37% chatbots.

Client churn: expecting ~2 clients lost per month.

I have 6 employees, each paid ₹40,000($458)/month, and each brings in ~4–5 clients monthly.

I’m planning to bring in two Professional sales co-founders, both fully focused on sales + outreach (not technical). I’d keep 50% profits while they take 25% each.

I want to run this while balancing studies, so the co-founders would handle most day-to-day operations.
(And the thing is I'm hiring Professionals, Who have skills in the sales and outreach area)


My questions:

1. Does this business model look sustainable/scalable in the USA/UK market?


2. Are my prices too low or reasonable or high?


3. What should I improve before scaling (processes, pricing, client retention, tax planning, etc.)?


4. With high fixed salaries (₹2.4L/month employees + CA costs), am I taking on too much risk too early?


5. For anyone who has run an agency in India, what are the hidden challenges (clients, taxation, compliance) I should know before going all in?



I’m not looking for sugarcoated replies — I want genuine, practical advice from someone who has actually run an agency in India.

> I think the short answer is just to speak their language.

If you're talking to the business owner then that means communicating your value in dollars or bottom line for them.

For our agency, we don't focus on the fact we sell SEO and PPC services. We say, "We get you leads." We just happen to use SEO and PPC as the mechanism to do so.

The challenge we've run into with our pricing and value is that website hosting and maintenance is included in the monthly marketing component along with DNS management assistance (updating records like SPF, DKIM, or whatever else needs added).

It's a challenge for us to communicate that value sometimes because the primary service offering is marketing and if the marketing efforts aren't performing as well as the client would like in a given period, the administrative component is completely lost on them -- a component that would cost them to have someone manage for them with no actual ROI to speak of.

We're pretty transparent on our value statements on our website:

[https://evergrowmarketing.com/about/](https://evergrowmarketing.com/about/)

We have our 3-core values which is all we need based on how we structure our services and we have reasons why you should and should NOT work with us.

Our services are also way more affordable then,you'll find almost anywhere else (unless you go overseas).

Having said that, we did do a few episodes on communicating client value on The Agency Growth Podcast. I'd check out episodes:

* \#005 (Adding Value to Your Services to Increase Client Retention)
* \#008 (Keep Clients from Leaving You by Helping Them Understand Your Value)

We offer white labelling services for a design agency who don’t have the skill set in house anymore to actually develop the websites they design, they’re great to work with and I know the feeling is reciprocated.

> What is it that makes you feel you need to narrow your focus?

Are you missing deadlines? Product quality diminishing? Leaving money on the table elsewhere?  Or no longer want to do xyz..

Sure, being more focused will probably accelerate some things, but acceleration isn’t always good if it sends you in the wrong direction. 

My experience: We acquired another agency just because one of the sr. partners had a quarterly goal to grow our firm through acquisitions. On paper, made perfect sense. 

He was so strict on hitting his goal, he would not push back his objective date. And fast-tracked our first acquisition. 

So, we bought an agency that wasn’t a great fit. Their client base was used to paying $500 per month and basically getting unlimited web support. 

No one tracked time, no one was really accountable. 

We were very different. 

We bought the company, and immediately started charging those clients our rates. And kept track of which clients cost more. And charged them accordingly. 

Within a year I think we went from acquiring 50 new clients.. to having maybe 10 left. Maybe less. 

The amount of time and energy my team put into learning all these new clients, their campaigns, etc etc.. all in vain really because the clients were never really a good fit. 

I guess my main point here is.. don’t sacrifice your logo term goals for short term gains. 

Is your goal to leave your 9-5?

If so, what revenue  goals do you have to make that leap?

Which product path is more likely to help you reach that mrr goal? Or, pick the product/ service you are most passionate about… and learn how to build the recurring payment model you need

Your 9-5 affords you a lot of freedom to take risks and be creative. I would leverage that to find your answer.

> The biggest challenge is pipeline. I wouldn't say there are new costs but rather clients and projects that take more time than the retainer allows for. The time overage is rarely the same service offering from month to month. The easy answer is to raise prices, but goes against expectations with off-shoring and AI.

The two options are most unique and one you do the best. 

What are the different market reaches? What does it cost to obtain a lead. What is the average time amount out into the sale. What are your margins on them. Do they produce revenue for employees. Do they cause everyone pain.

> Let me be clear, I didn’t say anything that there wasn’t talent overseas. I’m not knocking anyone in another country at all. I’m simply referring to you talking about big numbers. You are trying talk the talk and walk the walk. If you had a team full of team members just like you (the assumed great designer/developer that didn’t mention sales and marketing) you might could do this. How much does someone want to make with your experience and talent level? How are you going to keep people happy while you bring in large saas companies as your clients while your team gets paid nothing? 

I’d love to see what you Bruno your organizational structure looks like doing this 100k per month. What is the breakup of retainers vs project work. What is your value prop? What makes someone want to hire you? Because you say you are good? 

Do you currently work at an agency? What is your experience ?

I’ve been doing what you are trying to do. I’ve been in the industry for over 20 years.   If you want to maximize revenue and reach your goals you will need to hire low cost talent and charge high prices. That means you have a very large hill to get over to be able to charge $150+ per hour.   You can’t sell services for that cost and have language barrier issues. There are massive cultural differences. People in India selling services for that much are hiring native English speaking people to handle accounts.  The market you want to be in isn’t something l, realistically, that someone from India is going total into and run away with your goals in 18 months.   If a company is looking specifically for Indian talent in America they are trying to pay 15-30 per hour.   If you are white labeling and working for other agencies, this might get to 45 per hour — once you start charging above that the amount of competition that have American tech company resumes your value per dollar starts to get priced out unless you are able to be super niche or have an out of this world value prop.      

You’d have to get really lucky and land that one client that opens all these doors for you to hit this dude. I wish you luck but I think you have lessons coming. Answer those questions I asked above. I’ll be happy to give you a reality check. 

How much business (in revenue per month) do you think one person can manage architect, project manage and make sure is the quality of work you say you can produce to justify the prices you will need to be at to meet your goals. 

If you didn’t say 100k (lol you can’t) then you need to have someone as good as you to do the rest. Was it lower than 50k? Then you need three. How much does that cut into profit? What about the people doing the work?

I feel like you put a bunch of numbers in a dart board, threw a dart and said this is my goal and you haven’t given this any thought. Please explain to me how I’m wrong!

> It's going to be a tough sell. My biggest question (and one that the copy should answer): why should business owners use your subscription services instead of other similar ones or even low-cost no-code builders like Wix, Shopify, etc?

I think there needs to be more clarity about what exactly a subscription consists of:

-What are considered "Essential Pages"? How many pages is that?
-It says that everything is included but then asks for $100 for each additional page and other costs for more services.
-Mentions Content being included but doesn't give specifics. Does that mean your company will write unlimited copy per month?
-Table needs to be updated for mobile so it's fully viewable as someone else said
-What is "Eco fast hosting?" Is it a hosting company's name or a specific type of hosting? I couldn't find any info when Googling.

Those are just a few examples. You might want to check out qeretail.com for additional ideas on what to fix. They're a lower cost website designer that specializes in Retail websites (I don't have any affiliation with them, other than that we used them for 1 project).

> Seems like we’re in similar positions. I only get referrals & they close pretty quickly. But cold selling is tough.

I was going to say they have the brand name, but then you said they were startups.

Did you go to 4 demos of startups? Kind of lost me there.

Anyways, there are a couple ways i’ve seen agencies or one-man bands get appointments.

1. Call centers. Boiler room type: 10-20 kids at a time. Pays them 15-18$/h and trains them. You can find them on Indeed or Glassdoor. They are always hiring. TopSpot is one that comes to mind. It is a two-week, full-time, in-house crash course, and they have to make 50 dials a day—absolute trash service unless clients spend 5 figs a month.

2. GHL dudes cold-calling—These dudes are goated. They are masters at BS selling. They’re young and hungry. They kiss the ground that the steroid couple walks on. GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. 

3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. 

Lastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. 

Also, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed. I changed my calendar 2x last week for a guy just to get ghosted. It sucks man.

> Not exactly an agency, but a marketing consultancy; "whale hunting" is our deliberate strategy.

We primarily target P&L owners (like business unit leads) since the marketing functions serving their BUs typically don't have a budget for a service like ours, but we do get the odd marketing director or CMO keen to improve their function with us, too.

Our primary strategy is inbound with a mix of content and events, plus we're big on expansion (65+ percent of revenue comes from existing clients and buyers), meaning we don't have too much pressure to go out and hunt.

(Book tip btw.: grab a copy of "Never say sell" by McMakin and Parks if you haven't read it yet!)

Sales cycles and conversion plays can be very long (six months plus is the minimum for us; 24 is not unheard of), negotiations are sometimes complicated (think IP rights negotiations, liability insurance discussions, IT compliance audits, payment and exchange rate nonsense - most large enterprises will make their suppliers 'eat' both, which can be substantial - and other silliness [like your buyers not being aware of their corporate's procurement policies...]). And onboarding can be tricky, like others here have already said.

Add to that that a win is not always the same as work and revenue right away, and you see why this isn't for everyone: The first step for us is often the signing of a "master services agreement," which comes with a hypothetical budget; said budget is then only released when the client accepts a specific project within said MSA (which usually happens, but is not always guaranteed; again: we're not exactly an agency, so your experience might differ). 

But then: these projects tend to be "big ticket,", and the long sales cycle and ramp-up are compensated by very streamlined "downstream" processes. Plus, these guys always pay on time and in full. Oh, and we find client retention and development much easier with the "bigger fish..." 

But this last bit might be subjective.

Overall, I think there's no wrong or right answer when it comes to the "enterprise yes or no" question, but in my experience it's easiest to focus on one segment explicitly (so: enterprise OR SMB), since bizdev is so different between the two... I guess there are folks who can run two very different sales processes and cycles simultaneously - I certainly cannot.

Final thought:

Winning enterprise clients can be significantly more complex and costly than winning SMBs, and often there's more risk (we took a big cash flow hit when lining up a big contract with a Fortune "200" 2 years ago, with significant biz dev cost and prolonged negotiations resulting in a situation where the account ran "in the red" for nine month)... But I do find they're easier to service. 

Oh, and: the fact that they're a bit more difficult to bring in seems to make it so there's less competition for their business? ('s how it feels to me, at least... We rarely pitch, and if we do, we rarely see firms of our size [3.5 FTE] in t

> I'm going to echo some of the other sentiment here. I get 5-10 of these a day, this looks identical to the other ones I get, except about podcasts vs marketing or leads, or SEO, or *insert random market agency service flavor of the month here".

I would adjust the first paragraph, and tone. Personally it reads like you insinuate they don't know or aren't good at what they're doing and you can help them. Instead of a framing like that maybe go with a value proposition like "I love your podcast and want to help you grow it and find more of your people" your proposition is basically the same, get more "customers/listeners" but fring it in an enthusiastic way to frame it as you will be working together on a team towards this common goal you both want vs starting from a negative framing of "you're not doing these things right, do better." I'm being a little hyperbolic on the framing but you need to be, people are going to spend 5-10 seconds deciding whether to read or delete your email so assume your tone is dialed to 11 for the decision maker as a framing exercise.

Also, and this is for anyone here, do not send these emails out from any free email account. Get yourself a domain and a real email address or no business of substance will take you seriously or respond back and the ones that do are likely to be desperate or discount/value shoppers. Domains are cheap and you can use free zoho email if you can't pay for Microsoft 364 or GSuite Email license.

Agency business, like most B2B (Business to Business) services and products lives on repeat business. New client acquisition in the business space is the hardest and most costly part of the business so spend more time and effort at the start and also realize that most prospects need to be touched 6-8 times to move the the next level in a funnel. 

In summary: 
Cultivate a good list
Provide value from the start
Be persistent and consistent
Realize timing is one of the biggest deciding factors and you can't control it. You want to make sure when they are finally in pain, need, or fed up with current provider you're in their inbox or memory.
Answer you phone or emails quickly
Do what you say, How you say, For the time and price you say.

> That's a good perspective and to answer your question, it's true that I'm going to bear some extra work just to build relationship.

You know, most of the small business owners have websites which contains 5-12 unique pages or less. If I develop their website and utilize micro-services out there, I will have their website up and running with unlimited bandwidth, CDN powered and SSL included with $0 cost at all, literally forever.

If they want to have CMS, that can also be included and it will still not cost them anything but when they want to add features like e-commerce, taking payments online, or any management kind of system which is not static, that won't be free, and they will know that beforehand.

> I mean, you literally are advertising for air or your service that includes air. Not sure which. 

Air honestly looked like a viable option for a business we own (not the agency, but another business). 

But when we got on a sales call the salesperson could answer zero tough questions. It came off as scammy AF. 

If you’re gonna pitch your product for $100k, be able to answer basic questions like, “can I speak with a reseller” or “what about server costs and usage fees over time?”

$100k is a good chunk of money and wouldn’t consider investing in a license of software without due diligence. But thankfully by the end of the call the sales rep was down to $25k, so super desperate sounds. No legitimate business discounts by 75% in the course of 1 call. 

I talked to a dude who bought the reseller license and he said it wasn’t what they claim and he’s having all sorts of issue with the tech. Take that with a grain of salt tho. 

But good luck anyway. If you somehow make it work for your clients that’s a good thing. I just think it’s a shiny object with mlm and guru vibes. But do you boo.

Our client does landscaping. Leads are our objective, but our current strategy has been leads that go to our website and book a call with the client directly through a calendly embed.

We've been running the ads ourselves for about a month, having used an upwork contractor for the month prior. The contractor got us shit leads but a lot of them. We have gotten good quality leads but not that many of them and our cost per booking is pretty bad.

It is a local business, facebook estimates an audience of around 2.4mil restricting it to our client's service area in San Francisco. As for broadening it even more and letting Facebook algo optimize. I haven't really considered that before, would that really work with a local business? Wouldn't we end up with leads from outside the client's service area?

Appreciate the help!

### r/consulting — 2025-11-27 | 1pts | `pricing`

> This is the most streamlined and quickest roadmap to your first client (I’ll include some walls that early consultancies hit so you can watch out for). 

**Step 1 - Refine your offer, be a specialist for a specific problem.** 

Everyone selling “dashboards,” “analytics,” or “data strategy” blends into the same grey soup.

As a small firm starting out, you need to pick a niche + a pain point that already costs them money.

For example, E-commerce has inventory blind spots, Healthcare has reporting delays to execs, Construction has job-cost overruns from bad data flows.

You don’t need anything fancy, just pick a high-value problem, an underserved niche and you will likely find proof of concept there (the feasible service + niche you can generate results consistently). 

*Also: These small niches are worth tens of millions of dollars, it’s not like you're gonna run out of demand on day 2.* 

**Step 2 — Build a simple credibility loop (not a fancy website).**

You absolutely do NOT need a full-out website, there are teams out there working with zero website. 

What you need: 

First, just make a landing page that has: 

\- Services: Detail your range of services.

\- About Us: Share your story, mission, values, and team.

\- Case Studies: Demonstrating your success (or research if you don't have clients).

\- Booking Links: Make it easy to get in touch with you.

Second, you want to have a credible LinkedIn profile where you share small, practical insights from your industry. 

Remember, concentrate on being useful + credible, not being big. 

**Step 3 — Talk to real people before pitching.**

Forget big platforms, events, or “building an audience.” When you’re small, almost none of that converts. The highest-yield move? Targeted, relevance-based conversations.

* Find 10–30 people already dealing with the exact pain you solve. Think: ops managers drowning in reporting, PMs stuck in spreadsheet hell, founders complaining about data chaos.
* Message them with a low-pressure task. Not pitching — just: *“Hey, I’m trying to learn more about {{your Topic}}. Mind if I ask you 2–3 quick questions?”* People answer because you’re not selling.
* Turn insights into offers. Once you hear the same pain 5–10 times, shape your offer around *that* specific friction point.

**Step 4 — Outreach is the name of the game.**

Once you’ve got your first client down, build a solid case study. Then outreach and networking all the way. 

**Bonus: What you should NOT do:** 

Don’t lead with tools like Power BI, Snowflake, Azure, Tableau — Clients don’t care what you use.

Don’t build a product yet — Every first-time founder wastes months here. Talk to people first.

Don’t try to appeal to everyone — Capture your unique market then expand later.

> Remind yourself:
1) You are in the room because you have already proven you have something of value to offer everyone else in that room. You don’t have to act differently - act you you acted to have been invited into that room in the first place.
2) Great questions lead to great answers. Ask great questions so others can okay their part. Some value I would expect from you if I were a partner: keeping everyone focused on the core commitments and reminding them of the details. They likely don’t know them as well and leaders tend to think too much in the abstract. Help them understand and think through the connective tissue. What haven’t they considered- risks, challenges, ancillary services? What are competitors likely to offer - what is our clear differentiator? Talent, cost, track record? What haven’t we considered about abc? What if…? All questions/value adds that sound good or lead to good insights. Requires little knowledge.

> Aa a consultant, I can say that your research sounds about right. Depending on the complexity of the project and expertise required, it wouldn't be surprising if an experienced consultant quoted them $500/hr.

Given the company's financial situation though, you might only be able to get $150-$200. From what you described, it sounds like that would be a fair rate assuming that it could cover whatever costs you would incur providing your services to them. 

The one big thing that I would want to know before I start a project like this would be what do they know about their customers and are they willing to spend money to solve the problem you are about to build a solution for?  If they can't answer that question, then you could end up building a product for them that nobody wants to buy. Which in your case, might be fine because you're still getting paid, but that does nothing to help the startup that you are working with.

I have struggled in the early stages with a few questions:

1. How do you gain and retain customers? Building a customer pipeline is decently tough, I feel like gaining repeat customers that don’t just have one off projects has been pretty difficult..

2. How much do you charge your client? I imagine this is project specific, especially if you are working a longer term contract as opposed to a small one off project? How do you gauge a fair market value for your services?

3. When you build a “cash cushion” and think about scaling, what amount or percent of your operating income are you divesting into talent development and what percent return are you expecting to achieve after the 6 month mark? 

4. You mentioned you take one two contracts a year (I imagine taxes and cost of living will be different where you are), what are you typically getting paid? Also is it hourly, or a percentage of the implementation revenue, or a one lump sum at the end present of your deliverable?

> Hey, I answered a similar question in another post about how I got my consulting business started. I'll copy/paste it here, but feel free to ask questions:

"When I ventured out on my own as an independent, I found that a website brought very little value and only added unnecessary runway time and cost. A well thought out LinkedIn profile actually went much further for me.

I also got my own domain, but again I don't think it brought much value.

I spent way too much time trying to showcase a portfolio of services that I wanted to provide, but it was very difficult to sell (I suck as a salesperson). I had to decide whether I wanted to stick to my guns and continue to only sell the services that I wanted to do or to suck it up and do what I did as an employee (what clients were demanding and were willing to pay for): solving complex post M&A and other critical business issues.

I decided then that the most important thing was to land that first client to get the cash flow going, this took about 2-3 months. After that, I was so busy doing work for the client that I didn't have time to scout for more clients, so I focused on building up a network of recruiters, interim placement firms, consulting brokerages/middlemen and larger consulting firms looking for specialist competence that they didn't have inhouse (but I did).

The first client was the toughest to land but then it got easier and easier as more and more opportunities came from my network, making it easier to jack up the hourly/daily rate.

So for me, I couldn't really change the market demand to hire me for what I wanted to do. Instead the market was willing to financially compensate me very well for something I was already good at (but didn't really enjoy or find challenging).

So I decided the better choice for me was to accept financial compensation sacrificing job satisfaction for 10 years and then retire early from "corporate life". "

Option 1: consult their office and inquire about basic security services or reputable companies. This allows them to only let near who they trust, and to offer you these services. 

Option 2: contact your embassy there and ask the same question; review the answer with your client. If needed security is significant, ask if they can provide, share cost, or meet elsewhere.

> This is where the reality dysfunction goes into overdrive.   

Short answer: once you get past the basics (competence, resilience, strategic agility), there are ZERO universal & stationary predictors of individual survival in this space. Your continued employment with the organization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as the result of a multi-constraint zero-input analytical process where the only guiding principle is: "What does this salary contribute toward **future** exit valuation".

This is where you start to see the dizzying complexity of this space. For example, as the SVP of Transformation your value is "person who makes getting value creation programs implemented more likely, because they have the trust of the CEO, board, and relevant stakeholders." Selection process is: "best person that we can find who meets those criteria right now at an affordable price..." You and your team will cost around $15 MM in exit valuation ($1 MM budget, 12 multiple, $3 MM equity award) which they are going to want to see 10 X return on ($150 MM increase in valuation).

That's the math when they make their offer, at least....

The following day....

* Due to our factory burning down on national news, the board has decided to make a strategic pivot away from being a CPG company to a strict B2B focus. Given the depth of these changes, you will appreciate that our transformation leader should come from a B2B background. These HR people are here to help.
* The CEO is a raving asshole, we're replacing him. Roll D6 to determine your fit with the new executive, who is likely heralding a broader change in culture...
* We just paid too much for a company owned by a buddy of the Chairman and installed that douche on the board since they're now a minority shareholder... He's old school - he has his inner circle, who have been with him for 20 years. Everyone else is his personal bitch (especially if they don't have $50MM in the bank).

> That's an answer everyone must determine for themselves. I'm an evangelist for financial planning and personal finance knowledge. Everyone, no matter their wealth, can benefit from understand basic budgeting concepts and fundamental topics like insurance, taxes, and indexed investing. The vast majority of Americans, even many wealthy people, don't understand these topics. I argue that everyone can find a financial planner that will provide more benefit than they cost. 

Now, there are many definitions of "wealth management." Some consider this to mean investment management. Others consider it to mean some combination of financial planning and estate planning. Some may consider this term to mean a combination of all the above. There's no one definition. I'd argue that there are levels to wealth management, too. The wealth management provided to someone with $1M will be almost unrecognizable compared to the services of someone with $100M. Each client benefits from the service, but they receive different types of service. 

Short answer: no matter your wealth, wealth management can benefit you. 

Longer answer: the type and scope of service will depend on your wealth and personal circumstances. This decision is best decided by consulting several firms and individuals in order to gather the facts, weight the options, and choose your optimal route.

> It’s probably not an outright scam in that they probably do offer you some amount of education and get you placed in some sort of training position somewhere. It’s not really a scam if they deliver the services you paid for.

The real question is whether or not what they can offer is valuable, and the answer is probably not unless you can’t get a similar experience from just getting an internship yourself, which it sounds like you already did.

They probably don’t have anything unique to teach you that you couldn’t learn somewhere else or maybe even for free just by reading what people share on this sub. And obviously a financial consulting “bootcamp” isn’t going to carry any prestige. Bootcamps are great for people with no tech experience who want to break into tech, but finance is such a different industry I can’t see anyone really respecting that or being impressed by it.

It’s probably not worth the cost. If it were really that great he probably wouldn’t be sending cold emails to fill the classes. If it was that prestigious and useful they’d probably have plenty of inbound leads coming to them and not need to do cold outreach.

Say, I am a client looking for your services, I have two companies shortlisted. I am impressed with both but the other one is charging lower hourly rate and you are pitching in value pricing. As a client, you would certainly be on higher side for me vs the hourly. 
How would you tip the scale towards if the other company offered 30% less cost? Also, assuming if there is scope creep or some unexpected challenge, what would be the best way to revise or suggest a revision? Is it baked into the contract itself?

>The one complaint I have heard from the locals is that westerners always get paid more even if the local consultant has similar qualification. ( I.e. graduated from a western university.) is that accurate?

Yes.  We are affected by client wishes, contracts, cost benefit, and heavily by market rates.  My Lao consultants with AUS undergrad degrees and 8-10 years of experience are making about $45 - $50k a year, which is high for the local professional services market.  My Lao consultant with a US degree and ADB experience is making about $62k.  My US folks are $200k+

However, we only have ONE US long-termer who is the face of our project.  I honestly wanted to get rid of him and go all short-termers for international experts but the client refused, they want a foreign, non SE Asian face full-time, even if its not as effective.  

>In addition, could projects like these implemented by westerners perpetuate perceptions that only Europeans are competent administrators/policy makers ( rather than locals)?

This is an issue that depends on the country. In Laos, they want an expat face (Skin color doesn't matter as long as they are from a Western country and exude it) to help drive decisions and to be able to take the blame when shit goes wrong.  Its not just developing countries that had this but advanced nations like Korea that wanted a non-regional voice that could express NO and pushback but could also be the catalyst to finally make a freaking decision.  No one wants to be the nail that sticks out because no one wants to get hammered down - the expat is suppose to take this role and responsibility.  Expats can be more "expendable" - I can fire and replace them easily.  Guess who I can't replace easily- my local consultants who went to western schools.  Why?  Their father is the vice minister of X or their uncle is the Governor of Y or... basically in a small community, these people are connected.

Is it still heavily Western based?  Yes, especially if you add all ethnicities and throw in HKG, Korea, Japan, Singapore, maybe even Malaysia and middle income kingdoms into the mix.  My clients in Bangladesh love me some MENA consultants who can play consultants on TV.  I can take South Asians to TImor-LEste to help build their port.  Former Petro experts from Kazahkstan to Indonesia?  No problem.  

Basically, the best consultants I can sell are those who have designed and implemented successful solutions in many different countries and situations before and can walk everyone through lessons learned and a strategy/vision that is based on actual wins and losses.  

Does this help answer?  Of course there are issues with race sometimes but it also seems rooted in nationality.  I'd have a very difficult time fielding a qualified West AFrican consultant for some clients in Ukraine but an Afri

> This process will vary by firm. While we could suggest some generic trainings, your firm’s requirements for margin, process to estimate, how the interplay and approvals are done across service lines, etc. will vary by firm. Unfortunately. 

General process will be —

1. Prospective client issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) 

2. A sales team is put together with folks from each service line, each service line solutions and prices to meet the client’s request, with daily calls occurring across service line to share updates 

3. A solution review is done (by service line and firm leadership)

4. Proposal content is compiled, usually not drafted from scratch but leveraging similar past proposals, stitching together, and customizing, including verbiage and graphics 

5. Reviews are done on the proposal content (by service line and firm leadership)

6. Costs are estimated by service line, then looked at overall in a deal review (by service line and firm leadership) 

7. After proposal is submitted, client will down-select a few vendors to participate in orals. Each service line will provide representation. An orals deck will be compiled and dress rehearsals with all presenters 

8. If team wins, a statement of work will be drafted, with each service line drafting its portion, and going through all necessary approvals with firm leadership, finance, legal, client review, etc. and there will be next steps to contract, staff, onboard, which is where it hands off from the sales team to the delivery team 

Proposals are weird. You can do a little work on a proposal with high dollar value, win it, and your sales numbers look great. Or a lot of work on a bunch of little proposals, or non-winning proposals, that yields the same or lesser outcome. Start wherever they’ll let you to get your foot in the door and learn. Stick on the daily calls. Observe. Help where you can. I personally love it when the juniors on my team cover the daily call as representatives for our service line. Save me 30 min of my day, they learn, they bring back updates, and if they are asked something and do not know the answer, they can take it as an action to find out or ping me to join- it’s all internal so it’s ok to not have all the answers. I am professionally grateful for juniors who want to get involved like this!

> I would be very careful with this path...

My perspective is that with AI developments in the legal industry positions whether as a receptionist or paralegal are going to start to die out over the next 10 years. Short term it can be a good opportunity, but there are so many tech companies creating new software for law firms, (most driven by AI) that are outperforming basic roles at a fraction of the cost. There's [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) and [theclaireai.com](http://theclaireai.com) taking over intake. Clio making daily tasks even easier. 

This is not just in Law, in finance most entry level positions are being taken out already because of new tech developments. My point is be careful, if you are choosing to do this for the short term it can be great, but long term you may end up competing with a computer software that can do what you are planning to do faster, a fraction of the cost, and without the training ultimately saving firms so much time and money.

Take it as you will, and do your own research too!!

If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

> No, it is not normal. It's very rude. If you have an office manager that you feel comfortable talking to, maybe mention it to them. 

I went through something similar many years ago when I started out as a receptionist. Some of the attorneys would be unfriendly or have a bad attitude when I was being friendly to them as they walked in. It didn't bother me though, but the office manager noticed and called them all out on it in one of the attorney meetings. Her main point was that I answered a very busy switchboard and did so professionally. I always had a pleasant attitude and greeted everyone with a smile and left my problems at home.  She knew privately that I had some medical issues. She said you when you walk through that office door, leave the bad attitude and be ready to be nice and part of the team. She said don't you think the receptionist has bad days? She does, but she's professional and doesn't take it out on you. She was a great office manager. I learned so much from her.

Law firm politics can be tough. Get to know your colleagues but don't share too much personal information. Identify the people who are willing to assist you and the ones who are overworked and stressed and act accordingly. 

Best advice I got when I started out: If an attorney asks you a question you don't know the answer to never say "I don't know.", say "I'm not sure, let me get back to you." and then go figure it out.

And I let every attorney I knew know that I was going solo and what areas I practiced in.

Yeah I asked about training, he said I would get fully trained with the most senior partner and they would be happy to help because I would be learning by doing their work basically so that would be motivation for them.

The fact they are lex receptionist by name tells me they aren’t checked out thinking they called screened by a service.

With that said, I do love talking shit about bad attorneys so you know my gossipy ass was out googling the firm anyway. If this is the one in Vegas, I actually think you might be on to something. 

I mean, 195 solid 5 star reviews of Casey Xavier as an *attorney* generally, but from my review they don't read like actual client reviews and there are no case details, extremely generic. They read more like 'friends' or colleagues. Generic praise for the attorney and/or experience 'working with them' which can be anything. And zero reviews on yelp at the same time. And like 182 of those reviews are all from the last two months. Prior to that explosion of glowing reviews, he had a couple 1 stars. **Definitely seems like he bought the reviews.** 

>The disconnect between management and employees is so fake it's almost comical, and don't even get me started on job security – or lack thereof. Do your best and still get shown the door like yesterday's trash? Check.

This is common at those mills though, they treat people like your case. High volume, low care. It's unfortunate but a lot of the attorneys are probably working for a temp service, answering service, or are just highly underpaid. PI is one of those fields of law where a lot of staff can be helpful, whereas my firm has 3 attorneys and no staff (a full-time receptionist is next though, it's too much). Case mills tend to underpay people and churn through staff like crazy and cheap out whenever possible. 

As to the offshoring work, it's actually pretty common for stuff like calling for medical records requests and formulaic, admin HIPAA stuff. I've only seen the bigger case mills do it, and it's not really a great sign that the firm cares about your case specifically IMO, but that sort of work doesn't really need to be highly skilled either.

Consider the professional image you want to portray. Outlook and Gmail are both solid options, but Outlook might give a more formal feel.  
Both are reputable choices, but it depends on your specific needs. Take advantage of free trials to see which aligns better with your workflow.  
Absolutely crucial. Shop around, get quotes, and find a provider that understands the unique needs of your practice area.  
WordPress offers more flexibility, but GoDaddy can be simpler for beginners. It boils down to how much customization you want.  
Smart moves! Consult with a lawyer to ensure you cover all legal bases and protect your interests.  
I haven't personally used one, but many firms find them incredibly helpful for handling calls professionally without the need for a full-time receptionist. Look for one with good reviews and features that suit your needs.  
Best of luck with everything – from signing the lease to the renovations and beyond! Remember, challenges will come, but the satisfaction of building something of your own is unparalleled. Wishing you and your coworker all the success in the world!

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish. 

We get about 500 inbound calls per month. 

We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume. 

I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory. 

But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

They were supposed to make up the rest of their salary by building a solo practice.  If it was successful enough I would have made them partner.  Seemed to be a winning formula but covid ended up killing the firm. Payroll was too much in the end with no work for several months (associates plus paralegal and receptionist).  I started at the firm right out of law school with this same comp plan and I made 100k on the side easily within 2 years.  At 150k on the side I made partner. I liked the stability of the paycheck and ramped up my 401k by contributing a large portion of the paycheck.

Yeah this is super sexist. The men wear tshirts and the women have to wear blazers and heels? Wtf?? Very unsurprising that there's no female lawyers at this firm, your firm prob wouldn't hire them, only hires women to be support staff, and potentially wouldn't hire them as staff unless they're young and conventionally attractive. A lot of male bosses like hiring women to be staff but not lawyers cuz they feel female staff are less likely to ask for raises and more likely to be Your firm is sexist AF and could potentially get in trouble for gender discrimination.

Your bosses are fucking crazy. That's not normal at all. Don't be goofing off at your desk, but you did nothing wrong. If you can't even wear an apple watch to work that's crazy. It's like your firm has a really obvious pattern of controlling what their female employees wear...oh wait

The rampant sexism was already egregious, but this is the creepiest part. Security cameras are one thing, but those should be pointing towards doors and windows- not your employees. Many states have laws specifically banning this kind of stuff. How big is this firm? The smaller it is, the creepier it is. Even if it's big this is still insane. Orwell & Orwell is clearly a nightmare to work for. These psychos def spend a lot of time using their cameras to perv on their female staff. Make sure there's no cameras in the bathrooms, a place this vile would totally do something like that. Guarantee your bosses spend

I am now handling around 70-80 cases with no para/assistant and between answering the phones, attending court, sending medical record requests, keeping up with discovery and making sure my clients are seeing the  PT/Orthos etc- it's getting a little hectic.  I knew a few of my big cases would pop this year and since September I have made $350k+ before taxes which is more than I have ever made- so I have some money to spend on assistance and help.  
(1) When did you start hiring support staff and what kinds of staff were your first hires? (Receptionists vs. Paras vs. Associates?  


(2) Did you start working from home or did you buy/lease office space. I have been working from my home office but starting to get the itch to get out. I told myself I would give it a year at home which is coming up in a few weeks.

Random Story:

I love your Starbucks idea! At my old firm, I used to buy gourmet donuts and walk around town meeting local business owners introducing myself and buying their products. I also used to give nice gift baskets for holidays such as St. Patrick's day and I would swing by with Irish Soda Bread and Guinness. The partners at work would make fun of me and call me a "steak knife salesman" on their way to steak lunches/golfing and boozy brunch on Fridays. One of my referrals lead to an 850k settlement and gave me the confidence and financial runway to leave and start my own firm.

If you just want them to be a glorified receptionist for the summer, then your answer is "sorry, we can't afford that." If you think they have potential to be a great attorney / employee then you pay them enough to show that you value them.

> The easiest and best thing to do if you feel underpaid is to apply to other jobs and cultivate other opportunities. If they are offering more, then you can take an offer from one of them to your current employer and ask for an increase. If your current employer will not increase, then go work elsewhere. 

There is no right or wrong salary amount.  Employers generally will pay people what they are willing to accept for the work being performed. If an employer hires a receptionist that the employer thinks is incredible, and the receptionist only ask to be paid $10 an hour, it is not the responsibility of the employer to say, “No no no, I much prefer to pay you much higher than you are asking for.”

That’s not saying an employer shouldn’t pay more for great employees. If employers don’t want great employees even to consider going elsewhere, employers can stay on top of what competitors are paying and just match that without the employees even asking. 

So basically, develop your worth as an employee, and if you want to know what others would pay you, cultivate other opportunities and find out. Plus, asking for a raise without having a backup option is never a good idea.

Regardless, depending on your phone system, you could create virtual extensions called Line 1,2,3 etc, add them to a queue and make them pickup lines for each user, and set the call queue to be sequential with those "lines." So when a call comes in, it would flash as "line 1" and once answered, stay busy and "line 2" would flash for the next line.

> Yes we looked into the AWS route but the cost for the retrofit and server was too much to justify the age of the system and it capabilities even after upgrading. 

I would say most features are there on all of them. It’s really the end user experience that is the killer. It can’t be complicated to navigate or use. Some user want to explore the phones to see what it can do. Others want to call…. That’s it. The challenge is how to accommodate both while not risking a complete uproar over changing phone systems. They know we are looking but I’m afraid most don’t understand what is really happening. Regardless of how many times we have stressed it. 

Also, most of these systems are “you get what you get” for example 8x8, we asked if the BLF could be red to signify the user is not available when the status is set to DND. We were basically told the system is a package deal and cannot be customized on a case by case basis. Which I get but it’s odd to turn away a customer for something I would think a lot of people would want to have. No reason to transfer a call if it’s clear that user is not available. But the light is green so the receptionist transfers anyway.

### r/VOIP — 2023-10-13 | 1pts | `pricing`

> Hello!

I am in the process of opening a bar, and I need a business phone. All I really need is for there to be a digital receptionist when people call: 1 for hours of operation, 2 to speak to a manager (I'd want the call forwarded to my personal cell phone from this option in case I'm not at the bar at the time of the call), or 3 to leave a voicemail. Having text messaging would be good, too. 

My original plan, before I learned about VoIP, was to just get a cheap cell phone plan through a company like US Mobile. I bought a Pixel 6a for this purpose, and I want to use it because it is not returnable. I have been looking into [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) to buy a number, and then I was thinking I could use a softphone like Groundwire, Bria, or Zoiper. Is this a good plan, or would there be a better/easier/cheaper option? I don't see the phone getting used much at our bar because we aren't doing things like to-go ordering, a waitlist, or reservations. So, I'm looking for something simple and cost effective. It may be cheapest and easiest to just go with my original plan of US Mobile, but I think I'd lose the digital receptionist feature that I want. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I am very new to this world!

> > this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?

No, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).

Phones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.

Another thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as "line 1" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.

Usually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with "unlimited" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.

It sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.

If you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.

If your users actually want fax or want "Line 1/2/3" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.

Since I can decide who I sell to I prefer smaller companies since often the boss will still pick up the phone himself. But if I get a Gatekeeper I just say my name and the CEOs name expecting to be put thru and it usually works. If the receptionist asks what its about I just say "I have another question". I just keep it super short, if they keep hassling me I just tell them I have a call coming in, say thanks and hang up and dial the next. I never spend time with them or get friendly with them. But thats mainly because for me its a numbers games and I dont just want to sell to very few, specific people.

But it can only search for data or predict its retrieval if its out there and it's been trained on it.  This means putting guard rails around the AI train so it doesn't go off track.  But AGI or Generative AI is where the AI can actually do tasks and can reason and make decisions as opposed to just plain retrieving information.  Prime example.

> Yo, this is such a solid update — seriously appreciate you taking the time to lay it all out. Feels like one of those posts people will come back to in a year and be like “oh damn, this was the blueprint.”

Couple things jumped out:

1. $100k in under 4 months?? That’s wild, especially in family law where things can be feast-or-famine. You clearly did your homework and didn’t just hang a shingle and pray. Respect.

2. Smart use of Robert Half — expensive upfront but you’re playing it exactly right. Scale up with low commitment, test fit, then convert if it works. Way better than hiring cold and hoping they’re not weird.

3. Billing gap + admin time: Yeah that 60 hours a week with only ~25 billable is brutal, but painfully relatable. Intake and admin can eat your life. Have you looked at virtual receptionists or intake services that plug into Clio Grow? Even if it’s a few hundred bucks a month, freeing up your time might pay for itself fast.

4. Thumbtack... ehh. I’ve heard super mixed things and your numbers kinda confirm it. If it’s only bringing in $10k on $3.6k spend, and some of those leads are flaky af, might be worth redirecting that budget elsewhere unless there’s something strategic you’re testing.

5. That ad spend spike 👀 Bold move. Curious to see what it brings in. Hopefully not just more “free consult then ghost” people.

Also, kudos for being transparent about your numbers and not sugarcoating the grind. A lot of people glamorize the solo life but you’re showing the real behind-the-scenes — juggling staff, marketing, delegation, sleep deprivation, all of it. Keep these updates coming. They’re gold.

Sub’d to your saga. Keep killin it.

> I started my own solo practice in January. 12 year lawyer here doing PI/civil defense. Since going solo I have expanded a bit into criminal and some admin stuff that I've dabbled in before but never had the time.

1. Malpractice Insurance - get a few quotes, should be 1000-1500/year  
2. Laptop/Printer (I got a 400 dollar one with a scanner/fax that is not set up lol)  
3. Website - I built my own in SquareSpace. I signed up for Canva free trial and used that to create firm logo and "branding package" aka the colors and fonts to use for consistency.   
4. Stack. I use Office 365, Adobe, QuickBooks, Zoom phone number. The Zoom number routes to my MIL who will serve as a receptionist (calls are intermittent) I will eventually pick up a case management software but I only have a few files and have a file structure in OneDrive that mimics the file structure of the large case management system I used at my last job.  
5. A private mailbox down the street for business mail.   
6. A meager marketing budget (think business cards, joining a local marketing group, sponsoring local group sports teams/etc). I wouldn't bother with google ads or anything. I spent 1k on google ads and the calls were utter trash. Instead the organic marketing has brought me crazy referrals.

I have a virtual office so I spent a few hundred dollars revamping my home office and passed on formal office space. If a client wants to meet, many of them are not near me/where my office would be so they do not want to meet anyway. Lots of library rooms reserved, coffee shops, things like that. 

I've only been a solo for 10 weeks but in Feb I made what I made last February and in March I will have made 1.75x my previously monthly salary, and am arguably only "working" part time right now.

> Yes it’s pretty common. One big reason is to get paid for time worked. Another is to see where staff are spending their time so the firms knows how to hire next and whether folks are doing work that another employee should be doing. For example, if a paralegal bills at $100 hour, and the receptionist time is never billed to a client, then the firm needs to know if they are getting so many calls that the paralegal is spending a lot of time just answering the phone and transferring calls (which isn’t billable) versus doing billable work like drafting motions and pleadings.  A good firm won’t use it as a weapon against staff but as a tool for resources and hiring and budgeting and profit.  It also helps a firm know which practice areas are profitable.

VOIP: RingCentral and Grasshopper are also pretty popular - they run around $20-50/month for basic plans and can scale up as you grow. Both handle the professional appearance stuff well and integrate with most background check services.

If you're looking at call answering services down the line, I'd suggest starting with something that can grow with you. Traditional answering services can get pricey ($200-500+/month).

I built Breezy AI to handle incoming calls automatically and can take messages, qualify leads, etc. Might be worth considering if you want help with answering in the future too.

**We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)**

> We built an ai receptionist for businesses(Does Byo free plans worth it?)

Hey everyone! We’ve been building an AI-powered receptionist that answers calls, takes messages, transfers based on context, and even handles multi-language conversations using natural voice and accent support. We have a very competetive pricing as most of the other services are atleast $50-$100/mon for similar use case.

Our regular plan is $14.99/mo which comes with dedicated phone number 500 incoming /outgoing minutes and 100sms. With topup of $5 for 200min 30day validity.

We’re offering a Free Forever plan under a “Bring Your Own Telephony” model. Users connect their own Twilio number (Telnyx & SIP coming soon), and get:
	•	Free inbound/outbound calling & SMS    (billed through their own carrier)
	•	100 AI-handled calls/month included
	•	Top-ups available: $10 for 1000 additional AI calls for 30days

Curious to hear from this community — would this freemium model appeal to early-stage startups or small businesses?
Are usage-based AI caps like this a turn-off or a fair trade-off?

Would love your thoughts!

most AI phone solutions still have 500-800ms response delays which feels awkward. and they struggle with callers who talk over them or ask tangential questions.

before you switch, test each option with your actual intake questions. call your own demo line 5x pretending to be a nervous client who rambles. that'll tell you more than any sales deck.

> That's a pretty complex set of requirements, especially with the "legal firm" influence and not being able to run demos yourself. It's tough when you're trying to shop for something with one hand tied behind your back.



The tools you mentioned are all solid but for very different use cases. Notion is a super flexible canvas but can become the wild west without strict governance, which might be an issue for compliance docs. Guru is great for quick, card-based knowledge for internal teams. The legal angle usually points towards systems with rock-solid version control and audit trails, which is probably what's steering the conversation.



The trickiest part of your list is the AI that automatically tracks federal policy updates. That's usually a separate, specialized service (like a legal tech or compliance intelligence tool) rather than a built-in feature of a general KMS.



a different way to think about this problem might be to separate the \*storage\* of knowledge from the \*access\* to it. Full disclosure, I work at a company called eesel AI, and this is the kind of problem we help with. Instead of a massive migration project to one new system, you can plug an AI into whatever sources you end up using (even your existing Confluence, SharePoint, Google Docs, etc.).



We see companies in regulated spaces, like Covergo in insurance tech, use an AI assistant right inside MS Teams. It lets their employees ask questions like "what's our approved language for X policy?" and get instant answers sourced from all their compliance docs at once, without having to hunt through folders. It has Salesforce and Teams integrations like you're looking for.



This approach doesn't solve the 'auto-flagging of new legislation' part directly, but it makes finding the \*impact\* of that legislation across your dozens (or hundreds) of documents a matter of seconds. Might be a useful angle to consider as you're doing your research. Good luck with the search

> One thing I'd flag: 3 clients at $5-7k each is solid revenue but risky concentration. One leaves and you're down 30%+ overnight.

Here's the trap. You try to scale by adding retainers. But retainers require delivery. Delivery requires people. People who aren't you deliver worse work. Clients notice. Churn happens. You didn't build a business — you built a staffing problem with your name on it.

The game isn't "how do I do more work" or even "how do I get others to do my work." It's "how do I make the system the thing that delivers value."

What changed for me was stopping thinking about services and starting thinking about installs. A templatized audit framework that takes the same inputs and produces the same outputs at 80% less time. Playbooks that live in a system — not a PDF — that track completion, surface blockers, and keep the client accountable without you being the one doing the work. Dashboards that pull live data and tell the story so you're not burning 5 hours on a monthly deck. AI agents handling the stuff that eats hours but doesn't need your brain — lead follow-up, onboarding sequences, appointment booking. The offer stops being "I'll consult on your growth" and becomes "I'll install this system that does X. $Y/month. Here's what you get." Clear scope, clear value, clear boundaries.

When the system delivers consistent output, you keep your eye on everything without needing more employees. And you make more money. Everything else is just rearranging the furniture.

I ran an agency before this. Shut it down because the operational overhead was killing the margins, even with good clients. That's what taught me the answer isn't hiring more hands to turn the crank — it's building the machine.

> Interesting thread. I’ve worked on tools in this space and this is basically the problem I kept running into. From a client point of view, Google, AI overviews, ChatGPT, Claude all just blur into “search”, and they still expect the same kind of certainty they used to get from rankings. Under the hood it’s way messier.

What I saw was that anything showing up in AI answers still came back to the same boring fundamentals. Good structure, clear intent, actually answering the question. The work didn’t really change, but explaining outcomes did.

Selling this as a separate, guaranteed service always felt risky. Keeping it under SEO and being honest about what you can and can’t measure felt safer.

### r/agency — 2025-12-11 | 1pts | `general`

> The honest truth is nobody really knows what works for AI platform visibility yet. The "GEO" space is mostly people repackaging basic content strategy and charging extra for it. Our clients asking about this usually calm down when you explain that ChatGPT and Claude pull from the same web content that Google indexes, so good SEO fundamentals still apply.

Bundling it into existing SEO makes more sense than upselling a separate service you can't really deliver on yet. The tactics that seem to help AI visibility are the same things that help traditional SEO anyway. Clear comprehensive content, proper schema markup, being cited by authoritative sources, answering questions directly. You're not doing different work, you're just positioning the same work differently.

The client expectation problem is real though. Everyone read one article about AI search eating Google and now they want guarantees you can't give. Set expectations early that AI platform visibility isn't trackable the same way, there's no rank tracker for "how often does ChatGPT mention us" and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

If you absolutely need to show something extra, monitoring brand mentions across AI platforms and creating content specifically structured to answer the questions your ICP asks these tools is a reasonable add-on. But don't oversell it as some revolutionary new service when the playbook is still being written by everyone.

> You're probably only going to get people who are using it for lead acquisition and "appointment booking".

If you can't figure out where an AI agent will help you in your agency, then don't worry about it.

When you find something in your agency and think to yourself, "This is really annoying and labor intensive..." Then ask yourself if somehow AI can help with that.

Don't think about the AI first and then hold it in your hand while searching for problems.

FWIW, this is what we are actively *exploring*:

 \- Automating podcast RSS feed into our CMS to create blog post/episodes based on RSS data (it's less AI actually doing the task and more the AI writing the code to parse and post the data because we're not smart enough ourselves).

  
 \- Using AI to pull a transcript from our podcast episodes, having it locate the best and most engaging segments with time stamps to create the opening teaser (a process that used to take us like 2-3 hours to create now takes about 30-45 minutes)

  
 \- Inbound VoiceAI receptions for our clients' industry that can answer *missed* calls, take information, and send it to the sales team/CRM. Furthermore, it will transcribe the call, pull out key details (that we've prompted it to), send those details to a platform (that we've built) update information and then use the information from the call to update the platform CRM the lead came from automatically.

  
That last one is kind of unique. There's are multiple platforms we use for our clients where they get leads from and actually answering all calls and updating the leads in the CRM that's provided is a quantity/cost factor in your leads. Our clients weren't doing it so we had to get creative and find a solution.

  
 \- On the 15th of every month, my PPC team goes through all accounts and lists out which ones are underspending/overspending and are above the tCPA threshold. In one Google Sheet column, they write why they think they are over/underspending and why they are over tCPA and in the next column, they write what they are going to do / plan to do. We're exploring how we can use AI to take data from those two columns and for each client, email me/the account manager an email summary intended for the client that the account manager signs off on and sends to the client.

  
Sometimes clients log into their ad account and see things aren't great but aren't aware what we're doing to change things. This helps with that communication. They don't necessarily need better results, they just want more communication. So this is to help with that.

  
 \- Finally, it's kind of a long shot, but on the 3rd of every month our clients get their automated reports from Agency Analytics. I'd like to be able to summarize the reports via AI and send them that email from me. But the problem is that reporting and marketing is so subjective. Just because numbers are down doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Being in the landscaping industry, right now a lot of things are seasonal and i

> You can use AI, but you need to also have an idea on the context of the answers. If you just follow the answers blindly then you could end up wasting months.

There’s two things to unpack.

ICP - the types of companies
Personas - the people in those companies

For ICP, what types of companies need your service? Are they early stage or more mature? Do they need to have certain team sizes? Particular geographies? Using certain technology? Running specific strategies (paid ads - if you’re a PPC or CRO agency for example).

Once you’ve narrowed down on those; then you need to think about the Personas.

What titles? What responsibilities, what problems do they have.

Then you connect your service to solve those problems in those companies.

So have a think about those two points; use AI to answer some of these questions and then pick one ICP and the personas within them and start conversations about those problems/challenges. 

Does that help?

> Yeah the demand is real but most clients have zero clue how these platforms actually work. I work at an outreach company and we've had this exact conversation with probably 20 clients in the last few months.

The problem is they want guaranteed mentions and links when that's not how Reddit or Quora function. These platforms will ban accounts instantly if they detect any promotional bullshit. Our clients who've tried the Upwork route usually get their accounts nuked within weeks.

If you're gonna offer this service, structure it around building genuine authority first, not immediate brand mentions. Focus on having real experts from their company participate in discussions naturally over months, not trying to game the system for quick wins.

The AI overview angle is legit though. Reddit answers are showing up in ChatGPT and Google's AI results way more often, so there's real value if done right.

But honestly it's a pain in the ass service to deliver because success depends on so many factors you can't control. Platform algorithm changes, moderation crackdowns, competitor reporting, etc.

I'd only take it on if you can charge premium rates and set realistic expectations about timeline and results. Most agencies we know who tried this ended up dropping it because clients expected immediate ROI from what's essentially a long term brand building play.

> This is actually a solid opportunity for agencies, especially in home services. The missed call problem is real - I've seen clients lose thousands in revenue because someone called at 7pm and hit voicemail.

The key is positioning it right. Don't lead with "AI phone answering" because that scares people. Frame it as "24/7 lead capture" or "after-hours appointment booking." The value prop is about not losing leads, not about cool AI tech.

Your dental niche focus is smart - vertical-specific solutions work way better than generic ones. The PMS integrations probably matter more than the voice quality for actual adoption.

From an agency perspective, this could be a nice upsell to existing clients running ads. Nothing worse than spending $5k on Google Ads just to have half the calls go to voicemail. Platforms like VoiceAIWrapper are doing similar multi-provider approaches for agencies who want to white-label this kind of solution.

> A few important questions, let's give you some solid advice.  There's no such thing as "saturated" at least I don't believe. Yeah, there are lots of devs already providing web development services, so what?  there's nothing to do with competition if you know what to do exactly.    


First of all, mark my word its very hard and demands a lot of works. If you have huge budgets then ok you can burn your $$$ on paid ads and get leads instantly.  For that you should hire the PPC experts (true expert).  I know you're not looking for this answer.   


You're looking for something that works well and you can get lead,clients regular basis with minimum effort and can run your business smoothly.    


There's the answer:    


1. Cold email.  Its a very time-consuming and you have to send tons of emails to get some quality response.  Its boring and Im not doing it. As Im a massive reader, so I can confirm by reading others that cold emailing still works.   

2. Networking:  This is what Im doing and getting leads and even I made over $350k and my business now making $100k+ per year.  So, this is proven and I'm telling you from my personal experience.   Its pretty straightforward.  Just pick a niche/industry (pick an industry based on how well you know and passionate about the industry), then start connecting to the business owners every single day.   Find the way to talk to them. Join related communities, ask them questions and answer their questions.  The goal is to be well-known and trusted in the community (at least in your connections).  Well,  it could be facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, Instagram or whatever. first analyze your target people, whats the best platform they're actively spending time. So,   questions, answers, posts, videos, try everything to engage with them.  Lots of content.  Oh,  don't waste time by creating garbage with one click AI-generated text wall. Instead, read a lot about the industry, read a lot about their problems, even find the problems on groups, quora, reddit, even on google suggestions.  Then craft your content with informative information and post it.   So,   post content by adding value, ask questions that trigger them to reply, create conversations.   Dont try to sell anything directly with your posts.  When you become a trusted in some of your connections, believe me they will come to you and offer you their projects.  You know all the agency/company owner has lots of projects and they really need someone reliable and confident.  If you read some sales book or at least research online you will know that its taking a lot of time to take buying decisions. Then how can you expect someone to buy service instantly when you both just started conversations?  Im practicing this and I'm getting lots of leads,clients without any problem and this is very genuine way t generate clients.     


let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

One of my friends said they dealt with a situation where a bunch of firewalls were neglected. No updates, no firewall rule configs. Everything was default settings.

The real problem was that no one in the company’s IT department wanted to take ownership of the firewalls, claiming lack of manning, training and resources after 4 rounds of layoffs in 5 years. The managed service provider claimed that was not in their contract scope.

Claude is pretty good for coding and generating simple applications. There are other services that create useful 'mock up' apps for brainstorming. The Gemini-CLI tool (just released) is also interesting, especially coupled with mcp services. 

On the whole I think we are still in the exploration and prototyping stage. 

I've been focusing on using generative AI with large scale SQL data (MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CSVs, etc.) to allow a user to ask a question and get simple queries answered but also complex modeling. Obviously experimental and not a 'solved' problem, but promising enough for me to keep pushing on it.

### r/consulting — 2024-12-23 | 8pts | `general`

> Here's what ~~A~~I have to say about this:

# 1. The Limits of AI in Complex Human Problems

* **AI Can’t Fully Replace Human Judgment**: While AI excels at analyzing data and automating processes, management consulting often involves nuanced human problems like organizational change, leadership dynamics, and corporate culture. These areas require emotional intelligence, creativity, and interpersonal skills that AI can’t replicate.
* **Custom, Non-Standard Work**: Many consulting engagements are bespoke and require deep context, industry knowledge, and problem-solving that is unique to each client. AI may assist but cannot fully automate such tasks.

# 2. The Role of Partners Isn’t Just Oversight

* **Client Relationships**: Partners are often the face of the firm, building trust and long-term relationships with C-suite executives. This relationship-based aspect of consulting remains hard to automate.
* **Strategic Thinking**: Partners often lead high-level strategy work, which involves envisioning future scenarios, aligning diverse stakeholders, and facilitating decision-making. AI can provide insights, but the decision-making process requires human synthesis and judgment.
* **Sales and Business Development**: Partners drive revenue by selling work, leveraging networks, and understanding client needs—areas where human touch is still paramount.

# 3. ERP and IT Transformation Aren’t Going Away

* **Complexity Will Persist**: Even if AI enhances efficiency, large-scale ERP implementations will still require significant human oversight and expertise. Customizing and integrating systems across complex, global organizations isn’t a one-size-fits-all process.
* **AI Adoption Itself Requires Consulting**: Many firms are still struggling to implement AI and automation technologies. Consultants will play a key role in guiding organizations through these transformations, even if the tools themselves evolve.

# 4. Demand for Consulting Is Likely to Grow Overall

* **New Opportunities Created by AI**: AI will disrupt industries, creating new challenges and opportunities for clients. This will likely drive demand for consulting to help organizations navigate disruption, adapt to new business models, and implement AI-driven strategies.
* **Geopolitical and Economic Complexity**: Global volatility (e.g., supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, ESG pressures) ensures that companies will continue seeking external expertise to navigate uncertainty.

# 5. AI Will Augment, Not Replace

* **Improved Productivity**: AI could enhance the efficiency of consulting firms without eliminating roles altogether. For example, it might enable analysts and consultants to focus on higher-value tasks rather than being entirely replaced.
* **Hybrid Consulting Models**: The future may see a blend of AI-powered solutions and human advisory services. Partners who embrace AI and integrate it into their offerings could remain highly relevant.

# 6. Resistance to Change and Trust
