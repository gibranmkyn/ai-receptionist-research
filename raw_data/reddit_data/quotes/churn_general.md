> There are different understandings of solo "success". For one category of practitioners, "huge success" means maximizing profit for minimal effort. For another category of practitioners, financial success is as meaningful as the quality of service provided; money is important, but not everything. People seeking the latter success should consider the following:

\#1 - Pick up the phone. Take your clients' calls. Take unknown calls (prospective clients). Do it.

\#2 - Have a client pipeline. If you don't have the connections yet to get referral work...try a combination of sources: (a) look for contract work in your discipline (small governments such as cities and counties, as well as non-profits, often outsource their legal needs); and (b) supplement your practice with a handful of private cases. The private cases are likely to make more money than the contract, so you'll be excited at how it supplements the contract income. The contract work might generate leads who want to hire you privately. Very symbiotic. 

\#3 - Bill monthly. If you don't bill, you don't have money. If you aren't disciplined about accounting, outsource this. 

\#4 - Be motivated to solve problems. When a question arises for which you don't know the answer -- try find and answer, make some phone calls. If you don't like working, learning, and researching, then you  shouldn't be a solo. 

\#5 - Invest in your own productivity and comfort. Keeping overhead super low is pointless if you your work is inhibited and/or you're frustrated all the time because you have to do things the tedious way. When deficiency of equipment / software / space is costing you, resolve it. Buy the reliable printer. Rent the office that you feel good sitting in day after day. 

\#6 - Make your own appearances. This is related to #1. Do your own initial consultations. Make your own court appearances. Clients don't want to hire your staff, they want to hire you. You might be thinking that if you do this, you won't have time to take on as many clients...and that might end up being true, but you can charge way more for time, because clients will see the quality difference. 

\#7 - Be organized. Your efficiency (time is money) depends on this. Accurate billing depends on this. Your sanity depends on this. 

\#8 - Demonstrate your \[high\] quality in small ways. When you're a hot mess, clients know you're the wrong lawyer. So be mindful about your clothes, office appearance, even the bumperstickers on your car. At your office, have water/tea/coffee available for visiting clients. Use nice business cards. Air sophistication. 

\#9 - Consider how other lawyers see you. Other lawyers will (or won't) be referring clients to you, based on what they know about you. What they see from you can mean a lot for your business. 

\#10 - Rest. Make sure you have the fuel to be successful in the first place. Make boundaries to preserve your down time. When a terrible hearing gets avoided by a great resolution...treat yourse

> At many firms, paralegals do a lot of work that gets billed at lawyer rates.  When a new file comes in and a paralegal reads the complaint, realizes that it looks like the last 3 lawsuits filed by the same plaintiff's firm, pull the last answer filed in another case, then adapts the prior answer to the instant facts and hands the attorney a rough draft answer, and the attorney spends an additional 30 minutes to edit the document, add additional affirmative defenses the entire thing might get billed out as if the attorney did the whole thing.  If that service allows that lawyer to more hours per day there is value in that.  

In our Low Cost of Living Market most court awarded judgments for attorney's fees have paralegals at $175 to $225 and hour and most parelgals earn $50k to 75k.  

You should either charge more for every paralegal hour or pay your paralegal less.  A $117k salary for a $132/hr billiable rate is awful  Once you are over 100k of compensation why not hire a lawyer who you could bill out at much more than $132/hr.

> Can I give you an outside opinion?  I'm an independent remote law clerk.  I service attorneys across the USA and a few solicitors in the UK.  (I'm a dual citizen and I went to law school in both countries) I've clerked in a few state courts and I've also worked for office of the Public Defender.  I'm barred with a couple tribal courts in CA and WI and do family court work there.  With respect to the attorney I work with, I am clerking remotely whilst I study the for the bar.  I'm also a mom and I enjoy working from home and traveling extensively over the summer and still being able to work.  I love this work.  And I love the prospect of working in the same capacity (with higher rates) once I pass a state bar.

The attorneys I work with are all solo or small firms.  I have been a remote clerk for the past 16 months and I work on an ad hoc basis.  Sometimes this means working with one attorney for 2 weeks at a time, then nothing for months.

The work I do is drafting motions, appeals, complaints and lots of discovery.  I'm Lexis-certified so I also do lots of legal research.  I have my own robust Lexis and Westlaw access.   I'm not sure if there's a big difference between what I do and what a paralegal does - but I do have 2 law degrees (USA & UK).  I don't do filing or anything in PACER and I don't really do admin tasks.  I mean, if asked, I probably would, but my rate varies between $75-$95 per hour, and I think it's more economical to get an admin assistant to do the admin work. Also, I am now so busy with work I've had to hire my own assistant to help project manage my services.

When I first work with an attorney, I focus on providing a quality work product.  From doing that consistently, trust is built.  Some attorneys hand over parts of cases to me; some attorneys will hand over an entire case.  It really depends what's needed.  I don't have a personal preference here.

I'm NEVER the attorney on record (as I'm not an attorney). I'm simply a ghostwriter.  I've set up my own LLC and my own website, specifically working as a law clerk.  Once I pass the bar I will probably need a new marketing strategy.  

So my advice to any attorney who is outsourcing:

1. Find someone that you think you may be able to trust.

2. Give them a small project first, build the trust.  Scrutinize their work product.  Is the quality as good or better than you would submit?

  
3. Ask them if they use AI.  Ask how they use it, how they ensure privacy.  Ask how they ensure their citations aren't hallucinations from the AI.  They should have solid answers for this.

4. Ask about the terms of payment.  I bill my attorneys weekly.  I charge hourly but for big projects I will give a flat fee rate.

5. Speak to them on the phone before you engage them to do work.  This is helpful.  Some of the attorneys I work with I've never spoken to them on the phone but the relationship still works.

6. Ask them about insurance -- especially if they are sign as the attorney on record.

> I have absolutely no doubt that there are better or cheaper options than Ring Central, but I have no reason to seek them out.  Back in the ice age when I first opened an office, I had four phone lines - one main line, two "back office" lines and a dedicated fax line.  I paid AT&T something like $450/month for all that shit, and had a phone system with eight handsets in the office that I leased for some crazy amount - like $200/month.

Fast forward ten years, and I got rid of the two "back office" lines and the leased phone system.  So then I was only paying AT&T $250/month.  

Fast forward another five years, and I switched phone companies to a small service that ported my main number to a remote receptionist and my fax number to an efax service.  The phone bill went down to maybe $100/month.

Finally, I ditched everything and pay RingCentral maybe $50/month.  I can make phone calls from my "main line" on any device.  I can send and receive text messages.  I can send and receive faxes.  The app isn't great, but it works and is intuitive.  I still have my main number answered by a live remote receptionist during working hours, which costs me about $100/month.  I could get rid of that if I wanted.  

The thing about Ring Central is it's easy to scale up or scale down.  No complaints.

I actually use and like the AI a lot, but (a) I can't pass the costs on to clients and (b) I feel like I can get an answer quickly, but don't learn much in the process.

> I'm an attorney and do IT consulting for lawyers.  We specialize in small practices.  Here are some of the things I have learned over the years.  I have toying with the idea of doing a weekly tech live chat just to answer questions.

* Be prepared to do a lot of business stuff.  I have had a couple small and solos go back in house because they were just "tired of running a business" Others, really love the business part.  It isn't overly complex but it does take up time.  
* Set your tech up right and automate as much as you can.  There are a lot of good posters on this subreddit who give amazing advice.  Gusto for payroll and taxes, FreshBooks for time tracking and payment, QuickBooks online, Office 365 and so on.  Partner up with a good tech support company in your area.  *Make sure they use a program to backup Office365 for you*
* Cashflow is king, so work out how you will bill the client.  Local rules may determine your options.  I take our fee prior to the month of service.  I have seen some firms that will send an invoice and then auto bill a credit card at determined period of time, unless there is a complaint with the invoice.
* Costs and taxes will always be more than you anticipate.  You will have to pay more in taxes than you think.
* Try to get your contacts and mail exported from your old firm.  Partners usually get this.  Your professional contacts will be critical
* Make sure you have thought through your sales pipeline so that you always have new cases coming in.  Most partners leaving firms know their practice and know how to make it rain, so you will probably be fine.

I hope this is helpful.  Good luck, owning a business is amazing but it takes a lot effort.

> I really liked that Daylite was offline with a sync.  I know when I fire it up on my phone or tablet it will be there.  Clio requires a constant internet connection.  I also liked Daylite mail attachment as Clio’s is so slow as to be virtually unusable.  There’s also little things like being able to link a person or a project (matter) with a calendar date.  Clio only links matters to  calendar dates.  I dunno, I sometimes think about going back, but the billing aspects of Clio make me overlook the CRM’s flaws compared to Daylite.  And as previously stated Billings Pro sucks and one is just waiting for Marketcircle to announce that they won’t support it anymore. 

Clio customer service is also better.  They have live people to answer calls where everything with Daylite is done via email.  Sometimes that was frustrating even though I cannot fault Marketcircle’s response time overall.

> I searched through my post history to find my response to a similar post a few years ago. I graduated 10 years ago and also had a ton of trouble getting my first job.

>In Canada, where I live, you are required to article before you can be called to the bar - basically a 10 month apprenticeship with a qualified lawyer.  
  
What worked for me - made a huge lists of firms in my city that I was interested in. Sent out a personalized cover letter with a copy of my transcript, resume, and references to the most senior person at each firm. In my email I said I would follow up with a call next week. Probably sent out 50 -75 applications this way. Then I’d follow up each day with a telephone call to the firms on my list, crossing out the ones that weren’t interested.  
  
Some were rude but most were surprising nice and were happy to chat. Some recommended other firms or put me in touch with other lawyers they thought might be hiring. Some agreed to meet me for a cup of coffee just to chat. I got 3-4 interviews from firms that had no plans to hire but liked my application and my enthusiasm. I botched a couple of them but all you need is one. I ended up articling at a 10 lawyer firm with a solid reputation. It ended up being a horrible place to work but I got called and then moved on to better things.  
  
Everyone that met with me said they got dozens of resumes a week but I was the only one that actually called (and called continuously). One lawyer who never answered his phone eventually agreed to meet me if I would stop calling him (he never told me to stop, was just screening my calls).  
  
At the time I was searching for articles there was an articling crisis like never before - a lot of new grads couldn’t get jobs. With the shortfall in articling positions it meant every job posting had hundreds of applicants. I found this was a good way to get myself in front of some firms that weren’t even interviewing anyone else.

&#x200B;

A couple other comments on reflection:

1. While I applied to job postings, I didn't focus so much on those - I figured they were getting hundreds of other applicants who were also vying for their attention. Looking back I don't know if it would have been better to focus more on these firms or not.
2. Articling students generally aren't paid a ton -  I wonder if this factored into my ability to get interviews with firms that weren't actively hiring. Like taking me on wasn't going to be a big expense. 
3. I spent an insane amount of time perfecting my covering letter and resume. I had heard that any mistake in them was reason for a potential employer to pass on me. Now I hire articling students and employees myself - I barely glance at the cover letter and just care about the substance of the resume. I don't eliminate anyone for minor formatting or other errors. Maybe if we had hundreds of qualified applications I would though? I did get at least 2 interviews from lawyers that really liked the writing in my cover let

> This is a terrible idea. Don’t even consider it. Run. 


Source: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer 

Okay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn’t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:


The only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. 

You will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. 


*Why hours on just this?*


Because a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you’ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you’ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). 

This will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. 


*How do you bill 2100?!?!*


Oh boy… you will hear the phrase “capture your time” and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don’t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you’ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn’t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn’t billable and will add up as you’re learning). 


If the mind numbing work and hours don’t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS

You can’t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It’s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. 


ID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate

### r/Dentistry — 2025-07-12 | 3pts

> Regretting becuase income? Regretting because how hard it is to learn skill? Regretting because of what?

Nothing matters for a new dentist but people and dental skills. 

Dental skill for a new grad takes many repetitions and 5 years to grasp. If you have a hard time please practice on extracted teeth and watch YouTube how skills. 

There are so many dentists especially new ones who were never taught people skill and have very few dental skills which together causes your sentiment of regret ever choosing this field. Absolutely nothing else 

People skill? 

Some even say that I want to spend "quality" time with pt and get to know my pt. The question is does that patient want or care to know you? Why do you think pt want and care to know you? Do you ever say that you want to get to know the waiter or cook at a restaurant?Such misplaced mentality. No, you went to a restaurant to eat. Dental patient came to you to get their teeth improved. Nothing else. They do not want to be your best friend. They dont care to be your friend.  

How do we choose a restaurant? Online review, word of mouth refer. Do we know how they cook it or what ingredients was used? You know the answer. All we know as a customer of food service is how the food tasted, price and the service. Same with dental service, all they know is .... If you are a good dentist like Tommy then you would, should know exactly what dental patient want. Take care of them on the spot and "never" refer. If you are good then the price become secondary. All of us would spend more for good food. 

I am an introvert. Anything I say and do when I walk in the front door was an act which stayed with me over the years which intend to make patient feel comfortable. 

The arm movement, the things I say, the voice volume the way I look at patient…. All Great customer service and hand skill & speed are how you get over the new bill so you have new patients coming in as well repeating patients. Affordability of patient can be overcome when patient actually like us and when OMs use their magic. Most people do not have perfect teeth therefor it depend on whether you treatment plan those needs and able to take care of those needs.

> Currently stuck with a local VoIP provider that’s decent at best and “meh” at worst. It worked fine for a while, but now we’re running into issues they don’t care to fix or upgrade. So, I’m looking for suggestions for a VoIP service that can actually handle the following:

1.	Call Queue Feature: Apparently, handling overflow calls during busy times is too futuristic for our current provider. We need a queue system that works without relying on smoke signals.

2.	Mobile App: An iPhone app that lets us answer and transfer calls on the go without needing a degree in rocket science to set up.

3.	IVR Maintenance: Something where I can update greetings for holidays or change call routing without summoning the IT gods.

4.	Support That Doesn’t Ghost: Fast responses via chat or email—because waiting 24+ hours for a reply is not customer service, it’s torture.

We’re in the USA if that matters for anything other than billing. Does anyone use a VoIP service that doesn’t make you want to pull your hair out? Let me know—bonus points if the setup doesn’t require an IT team!

Edit: we have 6 employees

> April 2024:  
I agree with most of your assessment. Even during the business hours the person answering the chat works for some BPO. Even calling their advertised support number and trying to get a certain department you will most likely be answered by tier 1 support who doesn't actually work in that department (E.g. selecting LNP option and still getting the same person who couldn't help during a chat session).

Their first line of support will chat will with their internal team and then just read back what the internal team wrote, clearly not understanding what they're actually saying. I guess it's better than nothing, but still not great. Any time I need to actually get something done I just automatically call my account rep to get it escalated. Urgency doesn't seem to register with support chat. They will just say some canned response like "the team is working on it."

I used to have thousands of numbers with them, but switched to another carrier a couple of years ago. Mostly used Telnyx for a few services and a backup for outbound. Too many call quality issues that would constantly need route updates. When you're managing thousands of end users, you really don't have time to constantly supply call samples  only for them to wait past 72 hours and then have them ask for another one. I moved to another carrier and have had almost zero issues with call quality since (at least as far as carrier related issues!). Makes life a lot easier not getting inundated with tickets from customers to then have to troubleshoot at the local network level with another IT company and then to go to Telnyx for support and ask them to fix. 

I want to be fair to Telnyx and say they do have some useful features. Debugging/Call reports work well mostly. Access to invoices is easy. Setting up different SIP trunks and outbound profiles is simple. 

The biggest issues I had with Telnyx:  
-Numbers were given to another Telnyx without any notification. Months went by until the customer brought to my attention that one of their spare numbers didn't work. It was active in my account and was being charged the whole time. Support couldn't explain why it was in 2 different customer accounts and wouldn't give it back. This was part of a customers block of 100 DID's that they ported in a couple years before that. Customer didn't put p much of a fight so I gave up trying to get a resolution.   
-Numbers were ported away without notification for months while still being charged and marked as "active" in my account.  
-Needed to work out billing issues in which Telnyx had to refund thousands of dollars for. We had to bring this to their attention and their response time isn't very good.   
-Too many call quality issues. Switching our traffic to another carrier was the only real resolution for us. It wasn't the ISP, it wasn't the LAN. Too many of the same symptoms across too many customers. All resolved by switching carriers.

I suppose it's normal for a company to have tickets get

> Man all terrible answers from people who don’t know how to Project Manage well.

If you are leading 10 people across many projects (just like me) you know that you need to understand workload capacity and plan and have things like estimated vs actual time, prioritization, statuses, assigned users, etc and you need it all to flow to billing.  Monday is a little too lightweight. You need more of a PSA (professional services automation) tool vs a lightweight “project management” tool. 

Check g2crowd for PSA tools, and look at leaders in PM tools.  We use Teamwork which is not perfect but works well.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-10-11 | 14pts

> As a new (~1 year) paralegal, who is 55 years old and has three other careers behind me, this is great advice. 

There are ABSOLUTELY some things about being a lawyer (or in the legal profession) that are different from "other" jobs, but the basics of honesty, career development, work-life balance, "good boss/bad boss", etc. are universal. 

1) "Work from home/hybrid/chained to a desk at the office" are UNIVERSAL questions in the workplace. Don't let anyone lie to you about their expectations. 

2) My SAs are amazing in their "support" of me, so I "support" them back with equal passion and zeal. So *together* we've managed to hit some impossible deadlines and sometimes triumph on behalf of our clients. They are as respectful of my abilities and limits as I am of theirs. I wouldn't work for someone (attorney or not) who didn't respect their need to support me. That is the "price" of loyalty. 

3) I have been handed a task and told "go." BUT, along with that, the guidance to figure the shit out, and the acknowledgment that my first draft wouldn't be perfect. The best part of my training is when my SAs answer my questions with "here is where you can look this up" instead of annoyance. It makes me smarter and more capable, and also reflects that THAT is what they want.

4) To quote:

> "I've only been litigating a year and have no idea what I'm doing. It's a whole new area of law for me."

As a newb to the legal field, the biggest shock for me was learning that my SAs (both of whom I consider to be among the smartest, most ethical, and kindest humans I have had the privilege to know)... don't think they know shit. 

They are ALWAYS looking things up, NEVER assuming they "know what they are doing." Both are litigators. Litigation is, by definition, NEVER the same thing twice in a row. My opinion on this matter is worth fuck-all, but you asked the question, so my answer is: if you don't love it being new where you don't know what you're doing, *but can do it with the right support and time and love*, don't litigate. But that is YOUR choice. I f'ing love the fact that my last career will be filled with learning new skills until I'm too mentally weak to learn more. Then I'll die happily. But, that's me. Your mileage may vary.

5) To quote, again:

> (cue panic attack today crying in my office)

I "retired" from being a professional chef to focus on being a paralegal. There's a well-known phrase in the restaurant industry about "crying in the walk-in" which means going into a big-ass refrigerator and closing the door before you let loose on those excess emotions. The reason it's a trope is that... well... e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e has done it, and instead of thinking overwhelming emotions are "toxic", the food service community accepts it is part of life.

It's 10X that in the legal community, but somehow some/most of y'all don't simply accept that. What you do as lawyers is passionate, HARD, taxing, challenging work. And YOU have to accept the responsibility for s

> Yeah, that sounds absolutely terrible.  I use them just as a male drop address my first year so I wouldn’t have to use my home address.  I ended up answering my own phone for the first year until I purchased a separate answering service with conditional call forwarding
After about four months at the Regus I realized that Google was never going to approve the address so I found a different mail drop office.  I had to keep the Regus active as a male drop for at least another year as many of the cases that I started back then had that address as my mailing address.  As a mail drop it wasn’t very expensive. I think it was around 50 a month.

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> There are many services, and yes, BirdEye is one of them, although I do not recommend it because it tends to be very expensive for what it offers. Other services like Podium or Broadly have similar features, but overall, I think [Zidy is the one](https://www.zidy.com/) that stands out from the crowd due to all the tools it offers.  
Zidy’s newest addition, Zidy AI, can help you manage online reviews through automated responses, where the tool can write and reply to answers for you very professionally without you checking it.  
Besides that, the software helps you keep track of reviews cross-platforms, organizing everything into one big panel where all of them are present. I started using this service last year, and it doubled my reviews, so I’d recommend you try it too.

> I've been doing legal advertising for 20 years. It is one of the most expensive areas for digital advertising.

I've got a lot I could say, but here are the basics...

*Make sure people can find and reach your practice easily.*

This is job one.

Make sure that people can find you and actually get contacted back quickly.   You've spent a fortune getting this person, don't drop the ball when they do. Phone must be answered appropriately. Phone number and email addresses accurate. No dead links.

 Google still weighs location above many other things. So make sure your domain name addresses however it is people find you. If they mostly find you by name and your group pops up easily, then you are fine.  If people can't find you without already knowing your site, you might consider updating your domain to something that addresses location and potentially  your practice area because that way your practice area and location are everywhere on your site aitomatically. You can still keep your practice name domain as a landing page. But your main site needs a name that fully supports your SEO.

THIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON MISTAKE I SEE. A BAD DOMAIN.  Although it's nowhere near as common as it used to be.

These are things that are often not a one time job, but need to be monitored. 


*Spend some time on keywords.*
  The biggest success I ever had was using the form names used in an obscure branch of government law for ads and SEO because the only people that used that term were people who potential clients for this firm.  

Get real familiar with your firm's practice areas and how people find your practice areas. Note, this is different  if you are a name brand firm in your area this may be less important, but not much.  Basic content marketing and basic seo (tags and file labels and image labels and blogs and H1/H2  headings reflecting your search needs)  are basically free and shoukd be done as a matter if course. This takes discipline mainly. 

*Focus more on relationship marketing.*

Real talk, most big deals are done on the golf course, not the internet.

Even if you are a small firm that needs awareness to even get started,  building relationships with people that cab feed you business should be your main focus. CPAs and other professionals that work with business owners mainly.  Or if you get work from other firms, work on those relationships.  People hire people they know and trust.  Look at who those people are in your life. If your principles/partners are utterly incapable, you need to hire someone who can fill this role.

Other stuff that works:

Lunch and learns, as well as teaching classes can give you a reason to contact potential trial clients and keep you top of mind plus can provide evergreen content to support seo if recorded.

PR in terms of news stories, partners awards, charity events where your firms name is prominent.

Billboards- highly dependent  on area in terms roi..

A pretty website is worthless if no one sees it. 

*No one

> A template always helps.  However, absent a template work through the case in your head.  Research and review for complaint, draft complaint, file complaint, filing and service fees, receipt and review of answer, case mgt conference, written discovery, depositions, mediation/settlement conferences, motions- MSJ, motions in limine, etc, hearings on motions, pre trial conference, pre trial brief, exhibit prep, prepare for trial, trial.  Put a note that it does not include any post trial work.  Don’t forget costs and expenses, time for calls letters and emails and when you are done double it all.  Unless it will scare the client away, providing sufficient cushion by far beats going over budget.

> I saw your website and its a little bit confusing.  I mean at least you should add a tagline that people can understand what you do at the first look.

Don't try to attract everyone,  you need to focus on a specific community, a specific type of people. Then make your website concept very clear and your tagline should reflect the whole message in a single line.  

&#x200B;

**Simple and clear concept here:**

Find the people that interested in your service  
Connect with them  
Are you sure you can solve their problem  
Choose one problem to solve  
See the questions they ask   
Find the questions they talking about  
Talk about the solutions  
Choose one platform  
Linkedin,Instagram,facebook etc only one  
Create content   
Still content is king, so its up to you  
You have to make them ask you questions  
Answer them, become a trusted person in the community  
Get a few clients  
Do the best job  
Contnune...  
Im sure they will refer you more clients  
\+ you getting more clients from your personal network  


  
It's not very tough to understand, it's a simple concept but works. Otherwise, you will see a very hard time. There are many other forms of content marketing, but I explained the esiest way.   


If you do cold emailing, cold social outreach that's very frustrating and time consuming. Still works but it will take a lot of time and there's a lot of rejection, so that's demotivate you.   


Paid marketing is expensive. Im getting all of my clients through networking. Only networking.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-05-28 | 14pts | Mentions: **Ruby Receptionist**

> Until you hire a body, get a virtual receptionist like Back Office Betty or Ruby Receptionist. Work with them to develop intake scripts. Manage your clients, matters, and money with Clio and Quickbooks. Hire a professional bookkeeper to get you on the right path and to balance your books once a month. Ours works by transaction ($x/250 transactions). Consider flat rate billing ($x for complaint, summons, svc of process, $y for interlocutory motions, $z for discovery, etc) in stages for your litigation. This saves tracking billing which is just one less thing to worry about.

> Great breakdown! Your data on the plumbing business saving $4,300/month really resonates with what we've seen in the field.

I've found a few additional patterns worth sharing:

1. Warm transfers are critical - the biggest complaint from users isn't that they're talking to AI, but that they have to repeat themselves when transferred to a human. We built a transcript handoff that solved this.

2. Voice quality matters less than latency. People forgive robotic voices but hate waiting 2-3 seconds for responses. We got ours down to <20ms and saw satisfaction jump 40%.

3. Double-booking is a silent killer in appointment flows. Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).

4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list. We implemented an AI receptionist for a home care provider that automated their 20-minute intake process, saving $200-300k annually. The elderly clients actually preferred it because it never rushed them.

Have you looked at legal intake at all? We're seeing law firms with massive ROI on qualification.

> I would say do take the opportunity to learn from the system and rise in the company if you can.  


My simple suggestion would be to help the owners understand that what they're doing is smart for reasons people mention below (tracking and training and quality assurance) but your concerns are valid the risk of the lack of empathy can lead to bad reviews and complaints -- which is something you sound like you care about.  


I have been in both positions (a business manager, and someone who worked phones in entry level positions and reception roles) so usually the "script" will evolve for hundreds of unanticipated scenarios as well as unhinged people, and it will take someone with experience and empathy to drive the impmementation (even if through AI). 


Alternatively, if you're looking for a new opportunity don't put your previous owner on blast in the legal community -- simply focus on your strengths as many people are looking to hire intake coordinators.  


That being said if youre able to assimilate AI intake (and high quality tracking) into your skillset, you'll be more valuable to many law firm business managers.

> Agreed. I hate clio. In button vLex and FastCase methinks clio can only fuck it up given my terrible experience with clio. 

I’ve posted this on other threads and repost here because the same questions come up. So here’s my experience with Clio for five years and Leap since January 2025.

I’ve used clio for 5 years and become more frustrated with it everyday. I’d had high hopes early on and did deep dives on automation training and everything possible to leverage technology.

But.... Clio document automation is cumbersome and tedious. Tech support gives me contradictory advice from one call to the next. I had to create hundreds of custom fields to track basic data for automation and clio doesn’t let you sort them. Everytime i want to accomplish something easy I'm prompted to buy a subscription app.

Clio is a barely glorified Outlook / Microsoft Business abortion of a piece of Crap software platform.

And clio grow is even worse.

I even paid a consultant $3,000 to help me automate my probate practice. Money wasted.

I signed on with Leap because Wealth Counsel is packaged with Leap for a total price of $200/month per seat. 

I was very wary given my experience with clio.

But...

... I’m continually impressed with Leap. Document automation is so much easier with Leap than it was with Clio.

For various practice areas Leap has pre-programmed tables to ID and connect everybody associated with the matter. For estate planning, for instance, Leap features prompts for you to fill in all family members, all heirs, all devisees, all assets of various types, all executors, all agents,...

Then you click a button and it imports all that data into wealth counsel, where you complete the interview and create the estate plan as you normally would with wealth counsel.

So far, i have not had to create many custom fields in Leap. In clio i would have to have created dozens or hundreds of custom fields by now.

I created a deed template recently for up to four grantors and two properties. Took me about one hour.

You can even create a replicating table that enables you to program one row in a table and it will automatically create unlimited rows. So if you've got 10 heirs you program one row with the data you need to track for each heir. Then you can get the merge field data for each heir imported directly into the document you need to create.

In clio you have no such option to create replicating rows, so I’d have to build a form with a custom field for each separate item. Grantor 1, Grantor 2, Grantor 3... . And then custom fields to describe each person and their ownership interest.

So for a probate Estate in clio i’d have to build out a form with up to 20 heirs, 20 devisees, 20 creditors, with additional custom field sets for each of those 60 items. Overbuild early just in case you someday have an estate with dead heirs and lots of per stirpes fractionated shares.

In Leap i just right click on the prompt for Heir, add as many heirs as i have with contact a

> Receptionist - overseas remote worker. All calls with OC/clients needs to be scheduled (we use zoom for phones). I don't drop what I'm doing to answer calls (unless there's an emergency).

If the call is from a potential new client, reception routes to Intake, another overseas position.

If new client is qualified, Intake schedules call with salesperson. We use Clio Grow for new clients, but it sucks and I wouldn't recommend it.

Via Clio Grow, new client gets series of emails reminding of appointment, letting them know what to expect ect.

Salesperson uses clio grow to draft template agreement. Clio manage captures payment.

Case is converted to Clio manager where we open template file.

I use notion to outline, step by step, sometimes in painful detail, who does what when for every time of project we might be working on (okay, not every project, I'm still working on it).

Every month, legal team uses chatGPT to send client monthly email update. This is as much for me as the team -- I compare month over month to see if case is moving forward.

Case ends with formal closing procedures.

  
OP, the actual software you use does not matter. That's the least important part. Attorneys will argue forever about what software is "best." The reality is that they are all a shit sandwich. You just need to decide which shit sandwich tastes less shitty than the rest.

The KEY to running a successful, well-run, profitbale business is having SYSTEMS in place and holding the team accountable to those systems. You can write the systems on a napkin and copy them for the team. It doesn't matter. It just needs to be written down and you need to hold the team accountable to those systems you design.

> I didn’t have malpractice insurance for the first couple years and it was fine. (Not required by my state bar although I did have to disclose to clients that I didn’t have it.) Now I have it but haven’t had to use it, knock on wood. 

I don’t use practice management software. I tried MyCase but it was way too expensive and I hated having all my files depend on a third party. So I just use Google Drive and Google Sheets to keep track of everything. 

I have a part time assistant who is in the Philippines and super cheap. She keeps track of my cases on Sheets. Whenever anything is emailed she saves it to the file and updates the status of that client’s case on the Sheet and updates my calendar with what to do next and when. I’m also training her on drafting things for me like EEOC charges and Complaints for my lawsuits etc. I try to rely on her for as much as possible so I don’t have to do as much admin work. 

I need someone to answer the phone (my assistant is asleep during office hours due to the time difference and her spoken English isn’t great compared to her written English) but it hasn’t been an expense I’ve felt like investing in yet because I don’t get THAT many phone calls. Most of my clients text or email so my assistant handles communicating with them about administrative stuff or status that way and then I call them to discuss whatever comes up in their case. She sets up the calls for me and I try to only work part time so she knows my windows of availability. 

Sometimes my husband, who is also my tech/website guy because he’s a software developer by profession, acts as my assistant in terms of calling back clients, meeting them when they want to drop off documents or payments (otherwise I work almost completely remotely which is good because we like to travel and I sometimes have our four kids at home with me when I work etc.) or helping them navigate scanning and sending things to me if they’re older or computer illiterate. 

At some point it would be nice to have an in-person receptionist but I want to hold off on big payroll expenses like that until/unless they’re absolutely necessary.

> Edge series feels like a premium phone, and has that price tag too. Beautiful UI, great sound, we've not seen any hardware button issues others here mention. One downside is no physical hookswitch - the handset cradle is magnetic. 

Yealink - we would never recommend these anymore. Phones freeze, have FW issues, get ghost calls from sip port scans esp impacting work from home users behind home routers. Yealink phones get the most user complaints- recently we converted an office from T4 series phones to Cisco 8800 series, the receptionist hugged the installer tech and said "thank god" before drop kicking her t43 across the floor.

Anyone who thinks Yealink is a real option vs Cisco, Poly, Mitel (if you're on ringcentral) is not someone who has ever spent much time using any Yealink product. Sadly, these decisions often are made by such IT consultants who don't have to live with them and are just trying to close a deal with the lowest possible price tag for the bean counters at the top of the organization.

> If it was me I'd try it, good VoIP service is only $2.99/month so that's not a big investment to experiment.

One might guess it would be horrible (VoIP on Starlink) but oddly people seem to be doing it with little complaint.  But keep in mind you are switched to a new satellite approximately once every 4 minutes, so it's actually quite magical that it works at all for longer than a minute or two but oddly people have found it does.

I have 15 phones distributed all over my home and a separate two-story garage a couple of hundred feet away, many of them are programmed with buttons to instantly intercom key locations, it is so convenient and works great!

Whole setup costs $2.99/month recurring and $0.015/Minute for outgoing calls (takes a lot of talking to add up). Initially I used a small form factor PC that someone was throwing in the garbage and just installed FreePBX on it.

Interesting things I've done with it: I once loaned a Wifi connected phone to my next door neighbor for a couple of months (until he moved away), was easy to provision a separate number for his incoming/outgoing calls (extra $1.99/month, so little cost I didn't even bother requiring him to pay it). I still have an extension at an office 30 Kms away from my home via a nailed up VPN connection, super convenient to be able to "intercom" from the office. I also have an IVR so the SO's calls go to sets near her without disturbing me and people can call me without disturbing her. Also having your own 12 channel conference bridge at home is cool!

People think music on hold from home is freaky :) Got to love voice mail to email and of course answering your home phone from the vacation hotel in the Caribbean is also convenient (I just threw a VPN capable telephone set in the suitcase).

No end of providers offer SIP trunking at these sort of very low monthly fees.

Note: Most of my phones are of the good used very cheap variety, a mixture of Grandstream, Yealink, Snom, et. al.

With all the enhanced call handling features and conveniences, all of it costing next to nothing, I can't imagine ever going back to the expensive normal home phone line most people have in their home.

I had read reports and attended their presentations - EY, BCG, McKinsey, pwc, Deloitte etc. I was genuinely disappointed by the BCG study and the authors. It was on a niche topic I was obsessed with for my master thesis. The graphics were legit ugly and poorly done, and the authors didn’t strike me as experts on the topic. They couldn’t directly answer my question on related legislature. Meanwhile my future boss and team at Deloitte had published such smooth reports I was sending snippets to my BF. At the interview, they were interested in my thesis and asked very specific questions, clearly being very familiar with the topic and all possible ways of calculating my problem. I subscribe to Deloitte services sending me reports and highlights from the global economy mainly because the way they condense and present the info is so satisfying. I genuinely dig this company and wouldn’t switch it for 60+ hour workweeks at any of my country’s MBBs. I wasn’t impressed by what I saw.

> Wow. *Bottom-feeding clients?* 

I have to assume you’ve never experienced adversity before or don’t understand nuance? Because clients are real people. It’s so weird to see some of you forget that indigent/poor people exist? People in domestic violence situations? People hurt in accidents? People who lost their identities? People who are being stalked? People who have their savings stolen? People asking for DNRS and power of attorney?

They can all be normal people scared by the situations they’ve been placed in. And they don’t have our knowledge or security that things may be okay. Thats like asking people to stop using WebMd to check their symptoms. Yes, it makes the doctors life harder, but the sometimes the patient isn’t doing it to be an asshole. And sometimes the doctor *actually is shit.* They’re doing it because this is the harrowing moment in their lives and they don’t have a clue about what’s going on. 

I *hate* the way GenAI has absolutely wrecked the landscape. It’s annoying, it’s frustrating, and muddles everything when you’re the one who knows best. But I definitely have some grace for those who are worried and looking for some kind of answer or help during a weary time.

> Congrats on the new role! We work with a lot of small firms, and you’re definitely not alone, many still rely on manual timesheets until someone finally says, “there’s got to be a better way.”

What usually matters most for smaller practices is:

* *Simplicity* — if it takes more time to manage the software than the timesheet itself, it’s not worth it.
* *Accuracy* — missed or forgotten entries add up quickly, especially in a billable environment.
* Affordability — you don’t need a massive enterprise system to get solid results.  

At Billables AI, we focus on automating as much of the process as possible. Instead of manually logging, the software captures work in the background and organizes it into clear, ready-to-use time entries. That way, you’re not adding another administrative burden on top of your legal work.

The biggest “pro” we hear is that firms stop losing hours to memory gaps, and the main “con” is just the adjustment period—it feels strange at first to let software do the tracking for you. But once it clicks, the timesheet process becomes much smoother.

Happy to answer questions if you want specifics on how it might fit for a smaller firm setup.

> At the most basic level, the answer is simple: other firms are already implementing AI, and clients will notice if you’re not.

But the heart of your post seems to be: Why would I use AI when I can have a paralegal bill for the same work and make more money?

The short answer: because when your competitors stop charging two hours for something AI does in minutes, you’ll either start losing clients — or, worse, face serious complaints about your billing practices. And it’s not just a business risk — it’s also a reputational and ethical one. As AI becomes more capable, continuing to bill for tasks that could be automated starts to look like you’re padding hours.

This change is inevitable. Even if your clients aren’t pushing now, they will. There’s a short window where AI is still optional. Soon, it’ll be expected and you’ll be scrambling to catch up when clients start asking why your competition delivers the same result in half the time for less money.

As for upcharging: clients pay for value, not process. If AI lets you deliver better outcomes, faster, with fewer errors — you might justify premium pricing. But you’re not going to get away with charging for what’s clearly been automated busywork for too long.

alert communications but no matter who you use, you will need to train them and spot check some calls ongoing to ensure quality.   when staff changes over, and this goes for any legal answering service, it is inevitable  you will get the new employee asking if the incident happened less than two years ago  or  if a big rig or commercial vehicle involved, after the caller starts with, “hi i am \_\_\_\_\_, I was rear ended  by a car at a stop sign,  yesterday and wanted to speak with  an attorney to find out more about my legal options“

> Get some trial experience. Second chair cases until you're blue in the face. Do a bunch of hearings, as many as you can get your hands on. Get as much "face" time in court as possible. 

Monitor how the firm operates the business end of things. Accounting, IOLTA, payroll, hiring/firing, support staff, etc.

Don't do partners, unless you're the worst one there. Even then, don't do partners.

Monitor how the firm manages litigation files. Forms, software, procedures, etc.

If you can, try to create bridges with reputable PI firms. You'll know, rather quickly, how things are done from the other side, and which firms do things correctly and which firms skate. Once you switch teams, you'll have built in contacts to help you.

If you're at a ID mill, you will gain valuable insights. You'll know how to run a law office. Note what's working and what's not working AND WRITE IT DOWN. You'll see, first hand, people getting in their own way. Notate the traps and WRITE IT DOWN. No one wants to be dysfunctional, and many times they don't realize it or see it happen. And it will happen to you. But, you had the benefit of seeing another firm go through stuff from an outsider's perspective.

You'll also get practical experience on how to operate as a business. Though the models are wildly different, the core is the same. You'll learn about accounting, hiring / firing, firm administration, role of paralegals, etc. Take copious notes. 

As a PI lawyer, you won't bill for time (usually), so your relationship with billable hours and money will be vastly different, and will take a LOT of getting used to. With ID, every second has to be billed and accounted for. With PI, you're spending lots of time vetting cases. And you'll work up tons of cases that fizzle out. If that happens in an hourly shop, you're screwed. It's just part of PI life. A lot of lawyers cannot fathom that.

The main issue with PI: can you make it rain? Do you know how to market? Do you know how to drum up business? NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT SALES. You can be Clarence Darrow of modern litigation. You'll be broke if you can't make the phone ring.

The second issue with PI: Do you have the money to float? Do you have the cash flow to support a case pipeline? Do you have access to capital? You can have all the cases and skills in the world. If you can't finance a case through appeal, you'll still be broke.

The third issue with PI: Do you know how to handle cash flow? If you're a spender, you'll have problems. If you don't know finance, you'll have problems. If you don't understand how a war chest works, you'll have problems. PI work is feast AND famine. You'll have fat months and lean months. If you spend everything in a fat month, you're out of business for the inevitable lean month. If you don't have the ability to save for a rainy day, don't do this. PI cases are seeds. You can plant quite a few, some won't germinate, some will. The ones that do might survive to produce fruit, some won't. The ones tha

> There are a few schools of thought on finding out, or not finding out the budget. In a way, the price is the price regardless of how much they have to pay for it. On the other hand, if you want or need the work then you will likely be willing to fit your price into whatever constraints they put on you. Some people have strong arguments on one way of thinking about their budget or the other. Personally, if I can get the budget then I prefer to know the budget. 

So, if you haven't already, ask what them for the budget. There's nothing wrong with asking, and if you don't then you're flying blind. I sometimes use that analogy if someone wants a car, you need to know some details before you can point them in the right direction. New or used, low end or high end, features, etc. A car will get you there and back, but it could be a used Kia or a top in lambo. Apply that example to their project, a Shopify is not like all others, right? What will their budget allow in terms of bells, whistles, options, training, etc? If they have a small budget, you'll propose just the basics. If they have a large budget then you'll give them everything. 

Ask to speak to the client. If the design company won't allow it then it's a huge red flag. I long ago stopped working for intermediaries. It never worked out because you're answering to multiple parties, and in the end your client's client, who you don't have contact with, is the decision maker. That's a terrible situation to be in. And also, the intermediary can unilaterally cut you out whenever they want. You want contact, and a contract, with the end-client. If you can't get that and you still want to pursue the deal then you have risk that you should account for in your pricing. 

I like the idea of pricing in a set number of hours for support and training. Even better, be explicit about how many hours and what they get when you write your proposal and contract. Be sure to include in your proposal what your rate is for additional support and training, as well as for change orders. (they always want changes)

RE: bumping your cost to come up with the price. Are you adding any value to the project? Are you providing project management, scope management, communications, training, funding (you pay your dev before you get paid), etc? If so, include your time and liabilities in addition to the markup on your outsourced costs. Don't forget to pay yourself!

Before marking up the price, be sure to identify and quantify the risks of the project. The more risks you can account for, the better. So instead of arbitrarily slapping 40% on the developer's cost, first ensure that all your risks are accounted for in the price, then mark up on top of that for your profit. Shoot, 40% may be too low of a number. Where did you come up with that? Personally, I prefer to 2x to 3x my outsource direct costs because I have a shit ton of other expenses to account for besides just the COGS. 

Even better is to not price based on your cost. I

That's the super worst case scenario. Less financially bad scenarios are: maybe you're out of work for a year or two because you're laid off and the job search is hard. Maybe you take a lower paying job than your current role. Etc. Same question about these scenarios - can you guys make it work financially?

If the answer is "yes," then you're free. Work doesn't matter except for however much you want to care about the relationships with coworkers and pride in your work. Only you can decide how much to value those, but the first step is taking a step back and realize that you're probably not as shackled to the corporate world as you realize

Obviously I'm making a lot of assumptions about your financial situation which includes a lot of privilege that many of us have capitalized on, so if you're in a less fortunate situation, at least you can recognize that you gotta be in it for your family and use that to self motivate

> I can totally relate to what you're going through. I believe I’ve felt something similar to what you're described early on in my career.

I worked for a couple of big consulting shops before co-founding my own firm some years back. I’ve built and managed teams, and interviewed hundreds of people about the practice of consulting. Here’s some insights I’ve learned relating to your story. Take them with a pinch of salt, I’m just a random internet person.

1- Eat what’s on your plate; and dessert will follow. Stop distracting yourself by comparing yourself to your peers. Focus on the task at hand and do good work. The better you are at your job, the more levity you have to be you. If you're bored, ask for more challenging work. 
However, if you're half-arsing your current workload the senior team don't see an under utilised genius, the see a problem. Eat what's on your plate, and that will provide you with opportunities to progress.

2- If you're not getting useful feedback it's either because your manager doesn’t want to provide it (e.g., avoiding potential conflict, to busy, don't care) or they don't have the capability (they're poor at giving feedback). 
Regardless of the cause, the outcome is the same for you. In the absence of forthcoming or component managers, you need to find a way to make it easy for them. 

I find adapting Daniel Pink's "two irrational questions" quite helpful. E.g., "Dear manager, how might you rate my work on XYZ on a scale of 1-10?" If the manager gives less than 10 ask why it wasn't lower (proxy for positive feedback), and what would need to change to get it closer to 10 (proxy for improvement areas). Framing the conversion in this way serves to both force a perspective from your manager and give them a simple framework to give useful feedback to you. 

3- A great consultant knows that communication and bringing people along for the journey is CRITICAL to the job. Not so good at building relationships? Empathising with clients/colleagues to understand what's important to them? Or, adapting your behaviour to different settings?

Then either get better at it or change careers. These interpersonal skills are essential for a successful consulting career. If these are areas where you’re struggling, you can choose to actively improve or consider whether a different career path might suit you better. Most of this stuff are learned skills, it's awkward at first but I promise it gets way easier over time. 

Last thing...

4- Comfort with handling ambiguity is a must for anyone to succeed in consulting over the long term. There are two main types of ambiguity you’ll face. The first one involves dealing with client side ambiguity. each new project brings new problems, but we're trained how to navigate this kind of uncertainty; it's part and parcel of the job.

However, there's a second and less understood form; ambiguity regarding one's own career. E.g., not having certainty what industries/companies/locations you might be chucked

### r/VOIP — 2025-05-26 | 1pts

> You have identified two ways to do it. Either use a three way calling process, or use a Bluetooth call recorder.

The way I usually do it is I call a special number on my PBX that auto answers, requests a pin. Once the pin is entered it records the call. You then use the iPhone merge call feature to add a call in which you call the person you wish to speak to and whose conversation you wish to record and then combine them into a conference. You then take the recording from the PBX. You should note that the iPhone's conference call feature is network dependent, it must be supported by your cellular service provider. Not all service providers support it. There is also a slight downside to this method in that if the person calls you, you need to put them on hold briefly while you add the call to the conversation.

The alternative way to three way calling is to have your cell number forward to a number controlled by your PBX, who is then programmed to forward the call onto your cell phone using a DISA type arrangement. That way it stays in the loop on the call, you get the call and the recording starts immediately. If your are the person making a call, you call via your PBX so the call originates from the same number and the PBX calls out again using DISA. The person who either you are calling or called you never needs to see your cellular number. The possible downsides to this approach is that depending on your carrier and calling charge setup, this can result in you paying for a separate call and potentially having the callers number hidden if your PBX is not allowed to refer the caller identity information.

The other way is as you said, use a Bluetooth call recording device. This is where the device connects as a hands free headset. It basically records the audio and saves them to the device, either to an SD card or it's internal memory. There are two issues with this method. The first is that the call audio must be piped through this Bluetooth recorder, which also means you need to use it as the speaking/listening device. Quite often they are terrible for this with really crappy mics and audio. The second issue is again, they are often generally really crappy. I have honestly yet to find a decent device for this purpose. Every last one I have tried has been awful in some way (Poor audio, mic, doesn't record properly, bad battery life, etc) and there is absolutely no single device I would recommend to you. They aren't usually made by reputable electronics companies. There is another more recent type that works via the magsafe attachment and basically places two microphones over the input and output sections of the iPhone. In my experience they aren't great, and you'd be just as well off holding a audio recorder next to the phone on hands free.

> Here's an upfront/honest answer with no intentions of being rude, just trying to help.

First, get a job at an agency to gain real-world experience and learn more about marketing. There's no course out there that will enable you to run an agency. 

Starting a marketing agency without having prior experience in digital marketing is like trying to become a football coach without knowing how to play football. It just doesn't work.

* **Get an internship locally, wouldn't be paid but might get me the confidence.** Obviously sucks to not get paid, but as a last resort, it can help you get started.
* **Try getting a job, absolutely terrible pay but might get me real experience.** This would be a good option, at least for a year so you can gain some real experience. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.
* **Do another Google Project Management Specialization (Coursera), along with my Digital Marketing one it might help me land a better role at some company.** Courses always help, so you should do as many as you  can to learn as much as you can. But in most cases, they will only be differentiators for entry-level positions. Don't expect to get a better pay because you have courses, most other job applicants will have them too.
* **Learn how to run PPC Ads myself and work as a contractor for some other agency owner.** It's extremely unlikely any agency will hire you as a contractor with no prior experience. Their goal is to spend fewer hours managing their clients by delegating to contractors, not spend more time teaching you the job.
* **I don't need to learn the technical aspects of running ads myself, as I will be delegating it to a contractor anyways, and just suck it up and try finding clients (after obv figuring out my niche, service delivery, and creating an offer).** You won't be able to hire a good contractor if you have no experience yourself. I've seen this happen over and over, and it literally never works.
* **Get a remote video editing job with a decent pay, and think about building an agency around that business (will have to sell my phone & camera to get myself a decent editing rig).** If you have proven experience in video editing, this would be the best choice. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.

> Answering service owner here so, I'm bias. In my opinion, for people calling somewhere the first time, an IVR is a terrible idea. If you want to capture the lead, especially for high dollar services, use a human. If the answering service sucks, get a better one which probably requires that they pay more money. The industry is littered with terrible answering services that businesses use because they are cheap (the answering service). Many times though businesses hire a budget service to handle their very high $$ potential calls and there usually lies the problem.

IVRs have their place but not for first time callers where you want to capture the lead and business and not have people frustrated and hanging up.

The business owners need to really ask themselves what is the potential $$ for each call, then ask if they should cheap out on the solution.

The issues we've had are calls dropping, calls connecting, calls hanging up when we answer the phone, and customer service tells us that it is our fault and not the services'. 

  
So, we are looking for reliable service that is slightly less expensive than Vonage. We have 19 lines and 2 toll free numbers- only 4 users use the lines regularly, and the other 15 users rarely use the line, it's just to have in case we do get called. We all use the VOIP app on our personal cellphones, so there is no need for physical phones. Required features: Call routing for the toll-free number, SMS, and voicemail. Pretty basic needs. 

  
I am new to this search and know literally nothing, so any help in finding a good provider would be appreciated! Thank you.

The same goes for suggesting *against* a product, service or business.

If someone asks a question like "How do I do X with provider Y?", your answer should be "provider Y does not offer X."

If you say "Try provider Z instead, they can do X", you will catch a ban.

Do not talk shit about providers unless it makes sense in context. 

"Provider X is taking 16 years to port my number!"
- "Yeah, they did the same to me. Terrible customer service."

Perfect!

However,

"I want to do X with provider Y"
- "Provider Y sucks lmao"

Not helpful. Instead, try:

- "I actually did X with Y and found it very difficult. I would recommend finding a different way. Otherwise, you can expect Problem 1, Problem 2, etc"

> 17 comments so far and they’re all highly aligned. 

You put yourself at high risk of not getting paid, or not being paid appropriately, if:

1. The client isn’t ethical. E.g., they “forget” to report all or some sales, or they “miscategorize” sales so you don’t get credit)

And…

2. They have the brand power to drive sales. As an example, they may have a terrible reputation in the community that requires remediation before you’d have any success with them. 

And…

3. They do the basics to convert leads to sales. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve found that clients aren’t answering calls we sent them from hot leads. Lack of any follow-up is another common problem. Guess who they blame for their sales incompetence?

And…

4. They provide a quality service to your lead. If not, the lead/customer may not pay, they may pay less than the sales price, they may get a refund, etc.

And…

5. The client ACTUALLY gets paid.

All of the above are 100% out of your control. You accept a ton of risk for arguably little reward.

I would only advise doing something like this if you have worked with the client for some time, and are sure they don’t have any of the above common problems that the vast majority of businesses have.

Also, only do something if you are rock-solid confident in your ability to deliver. I don’t mean having blind faith that you’ll rise to the occasion. I mean you’ve done it dozens of times, you know very specifically what you’re getting into, and you know exactly what it will take of you and the client to pull it off. Think science, not emotion. 

Lastly, you must get full buy-in from the client that they will do their part. Not a token “yah sure,” - a contractual obligation do so with a penalty if they don’t fulfill their end of the agreement (you’ll have wasted your time and money if they don’t).

If I were in your position, I would opt for a combination of what u/willmanracing and u/its_akhil_mishra have recommended.

1. Lower your base recurring fees. 

2. Ask the client to increase ad spend.

3. Negotiation to get paid per lead. 

I wouldn’t get into the business of calling my clients customers to qualify them. That’s time consuming, you’ll likely have trouble reaching many of them, and it’s messy AF. In the end, it won’t matter when your client disagrees with your assessment that a prospect is qualified. 

Sell leads if anything. I’d avoid selling leads that the client says are good leads (remember, they have to do all of those five things above to make this worthwhile for you, and if they’re unethical it’ll be easy for them to wave their hand and say a lead sucks). It’s stay clear of selling revenue. 

To that last point, NEVER link your payment to their profit or profit per lead you send them. It’s almost impossible for business owners to accurately determine profit per customer, and requires substantial assumption of activity base costing that are literally none of your business. Their profit is 100% out of your control even if

> Great question with a difficult answer.

Unfortunately I've seen some clients ask for proposals/tenders like these as a negotiating tactic. They ask for all-inclusive pricing with the full knowledge that they'll cut out big parts and get the cheapest possible.

It's really hard to retroactively price, but what I would do is send over the same services "broken out" and say that your previous tender had an X% discount for the whole package.

Don't take the hit to the bottom line. I don't think it's worth it, even more so because cheap clients like this are usually terrible to work with. They will continue nickel & diming you.

The only way to solve this is by not offering a la carte in the first place (not always an option, but probably worth exploring for the future). After a few times of having bad experiences offering a la carte services, around five years ago we shifted our agency to all or nothing. We work on a flat fee retainer model: you get the whole shebang of ad management, ongoing optimization, reporting, dashboard, analytics, or you don't get anything at all.

> I think free consults are a great way to drive business. We’ve worked with a lot of firms on stuff like this and it’s just comes down to a simple prescreen. 

Whether it’s a form, ai chat / voice assistant, or over the phone with your receptionist assistant. Goal is to gather details and get the consultation booked. Once you have details you’re prepped and ready and know which direction to take. 

You should be able to immediately figure out if this should be referred out, if it’s just a quick chat or needs more time, etc. Don’t be afraid to set expectations and limits immediately. “Hey, this sounds interesting. I’ve got a pretty busy calendar today but could you tell me a little more about what’s going?”

-Let them explain. Give a little bit of your thoughts and let them know whether this conversation should continue with you and your fee.

Worst case: You’ve got a new contact and you spent 5-10 minutes on the phone. Never know if that little question comes back later as a bigger problem you can actually help with.

Alternatively, if you have the ability, kick that to a paralegal to dig a little deeper before it gets to you.

> This is exactly why I usually don’t recommend Martindale-Hubbell. They charge high monthly fees, the sites look dated, and the worst part is they “own” everything — so if you ever want to leave, you’re stuck.

For a firm your size, I’d recommend building on **WordPress**. It’s user-friendly, easy to update, and if it’s set up the right way from the start, it gives you a solid foundation for growth. That way, even if you’re not super techy, you or the attorneys can still edit pages, post updates, or add bios without needing a middleman.

The key is investing in a **professional setup**. You can absolutely find someone on Fiverr for cheap, but you’ll usually end up with a clunky site that doesn’t perform. A properly built WordPress site can look clean, run fast, and last you years — while also being built to support SEO, PPC, and even Local Service Ads if you decide to run those later.

I specialize in working with firms in similar spots and the biggest difference is building the site not just to “look decent,” but to actually **support lead generation**. Even if most of your business is referral-based, having a site that shows up when someone Googles your firm name or “criminal defense near \[city\]” or "attorney \[attorney+name\]" makes a huge difference.

So my advice: skip Martindale, set up on WordPress, get it built right once, and then you’ll have something that’s professional, easy to manage, and not tied to a crazy monthly fee.

> You can probably still amend or file a notice of errata. Point it out to your boss is painful. But saying, “I caught this mistake, here are potential solutions” is miles better than staying silent and letting it become an unfixable problem. Everyone makes mistakes now and again. Even lawyers. Catching it shows humility and responsibility. Your boss might be a little upset, but it’s not the worst thing in the world. 

Also depending on your state the fact that they weren’t served properly won’t matter too. You filed an answer, so you obviously have notice of the case. The remedy for improper service is usually for the court to order service. And if you’re standing there in court the judge can turn to you and say, will you accept service.

I certainly don’t have all the answers, and I have a long way to go, but I’ve been building towards what you are talking about.

  
No one cares where you went to law school. I went to what many consider the worst law school in the country. I have been asked where I went to law school by a client 1 time in 7 years of practice. And he was actually a business law client.

  
Work somewhere out of law school where you can work with excellent attorneys and do a shit ton of cases and take them to trial when it’s appropriate. Look to those excellent attorneys for mentorship. Today I’m working on voir dire questions for a case that two mentors of mine are trying next week. I’m not getting paid, I’m just doing it for the love of the game. They asked me for help because I kicked 8 jurors for cause in a felony DUI trial last week leading to me winning a case I had no right to (technically, one charge hung 9NG-3G). The way I did that was by using a method I learned from another exceptionally talented attorney I go to for advice.

  
I’ll help other attorneys with trials for free. Sometimes I’ll just spectate on trials. 

  
Have excellent customer service. I loved House MD as a kid, but in real life House wouldn’t be a great doctor despite his technical brilliance. Bedside manner is fucking huge in any service industry. There are occasions where my client gets the same result they would have gotten with a PD or even pro se. A lot of what clients pay you for is for peace of mind. They want to know they are getting the best possible outcome. Never underestimate the value of just being emotional support.

  
Make sure people hear about that customer service. I worked for my last firm for 13 months. In that time, I got well over 100 google reviews for his firm that mentioned me. Now when a person is looking at his site, they hear about how highly people think of me. Can’t say any of them have been famous, but I have gotten a few calls in the last two months (how long I’ve been solo) to the effect of “I’ve got \_\_\_\_\_ charges and I hear you’re the guy/the best/awesome”. Usually they read that on a review somewhere, or a friend told them. I’ve gotten a Google review was from a juror who was impressed by me. I handed out 5 business cards to the jurors in my last trial last week.



I will talk to strangers in the courthouse about their case. It is obvious to everyone who meets me that I have a deep passion and love for what I do. Given a choice between being first chair on the next OJ trial and a billion dollars, my friend and colleagues all know what I‘d pick.

I've had them try to serve and RA in states where such service must be made during business hours, at 10pm. then say, "we need a new address, that one's not viable."

I've also had them fail to follow the statute and ask "is the CEO here, manager, etc., collecting the answers until they can serve any individual present over 18.

> Part 1

Hi r/legaltech! I'm Alex, the Social Media & Community Manager at iManage. Thank you for raising the questions. I've taken the thread back to the iManage Product Team, and we have prepared the response below.

\-

Thanks for the discussion here. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback, and we'd like to address some important misconceptions directly.  
  
**RE: Semantic search vs. keyword search**  
Several commenters raised a core tension: lawyers want *exact* matches, not fuzzy semantic approximations. As someone mentioned: "If I'm searching iManage for a document or specific phrase, that's what I want - exactly."

  
**We hear you, and we agree**  
Ask iManage is not replacing keyword search or forcing semantic matching on users who don't want it. Traditional search isn't going anywhere. We've built a different tool to solve a different problem: answering questions that might span multiple documents when you *don't* already know exactly what you're looking for.

  
When you know the document name or a precise phrase - use search. When you need to synthesize information across matters, find patterns in past work, or answer questions like, "What termination provisions have we used in vendor agreements?" - that's what Ask iManage is for.

  
To clarify how it works: **it's agentic retrieval over the Work API, not full RAG with embeddings over your entire DMS.** The system iterates through multiple search strategies using Work's existing filters, security, and ranking to narrow down to a high-confidence set of documents. Any semantic analysis happens *post-retrieval* on that smaller candidate set, not by maintaining vector embeddings for millions of documents. This approach ensures the DMS security model stays intact.  
  
**RE: Timing and pace of innovation**  
One commenter asked why this wasn't introduced "\~2 years ago when RAG was all the craze." Transparently, it's because we wanted to get it right for professional services environments, and not ship something that could frustrate more than help. RAG over a challenging, permission-controlled document repository with millions of emails is a genuinely hard problem - as several of you noted. Garbage in, garbage out.

  
We spent that time solving for:

* **Security-first retrieval** that respects your existing permissions
* **Iterative search strategies** that use structured metadata, not just embeddings
* **Answer quality** with citations users can verify, not confident-sounding hallucinations
* **Agentic architecture** that reasons about what to search for, not just what matches a query

Shipping early would have validated every skeptic's worst fears about AI in legal. We wanted Ask iManage to be useful in more ways.

> Super exciting! Congrats on the opportunity. You're going to crush it.

One very helpful mantra I have learned ([from DHH of Basecamp](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71)) I tell myself all the time is: **when you plan a project, you are doing so with the absolute worst understanding of the problem.**

When I first started my agency (one year ago, still very new to the game), I was completely paralyzed when it came to writing my first proposals. I told myself: *"how am I supposed to confidently present a plan for something...when I've never done that thing? They'll know I'm full of shit...or I'll estimate everything all wrong and will look like a fool."* So my advice is keep your proposal as simple as possible, focus on the things you do know to be true versus what is variable, and know that projects will always evolve over their course. Priorities shift, clients want changes, what you launch doesn't work perfectly, etc. This is fundamental to the process of making anything, and going in with a positive and adaptable mindset is the most helpful frame.

* **In terms of time,** that's an easy place to start - how much can you realistically devote \*without\* impacting other parts of your life that are important to you? **Only you and you alone can set your boundaries.** So if the answer is 2 hours every other day (so Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), then the answer is 6 hours per week. If you don't draw a clear line in the sand, the people you're working with won't know what is reasonable for you - so they'll ask for more. And not because they're inherently demanding, just because they don't know your boundaries. And without boundaries, you'll come to resent the work - and that's a bad place to be. So ask yourself what *you* *want*.
* **What you do vs delegate**: again, this is all about your boundaries. It seems like it's important for you \*not\* to run socials yourself, so make that clear to your business partner. Offer to work together to find someone who can dot hat work that works within the project's budget. Or, if you want to take ownership of hiring and managing that person, that's your choice - just make sure the price you charge incorporates that cost.
* **Your hourly rate** is hard to help out with without more information. It depends on your location, your years of experience, the project's budget, what similar consultants in your area/market charge for similar services, and more.
   * But since this is your first project, I wouldn't get too hung up on price - you can always charge more for the next project. I would consider the floor price the minimum amount that is worth your time. Said another way, it can't be *so low* that when you're mid-way through the project, you're upset that you didn't charge enough. That's another easy path towards resentment and feeling taken advantage of.
   * Another way to think about it is: if you put a price that's too high in your proposal, your bus

### r/agency — 2024-07-15 | 3pts

> A few options...  
  
1. **Do nothing**. 

Don't accept the deal and see where it goes. Maybe they'll forget about it...maybe not. Not a great option. It's best to transparently discuss these kinds of things with your clients.

2. **Take the deal**. 

If you take the deal then there are many side effects to consider.   
a) What's the opportunity cost? Not just financially from other deals that will no longer materialize, but also in the risk of working for just one client.   
b) Can you guarantee they will pay you?   
c) Can you guarantee that they'll continue to use your services?  For how long and at what levels?  
d) Can you gain exclusivity with them too? In other words, if you can't work for anyone else, will they commit to not hiring anyone else for their YT/socials? This is a real threat because it's 100% possible and even likely that they could dilute what they give you over time.    
e) Can you get a higher rate or more services (e.g., not just YT, but what about other platforms too like IG) that with your existing arrangement?  
f) What are the contract terms? How long are they locking in for? I'd make it at least two years.

3) **Reject the deal**. 

The big con with their proposal is that they'll be taking 100% of your agency's resources, bandwidth, and future opportunities. If you take a deal, you're effectively not an agency anymore...you're a contract vehicle to provide individual talent to a single client...a staff augmentation contractor. You wouldn't have much of a future, if any, as an agency. There's nothing wrong with that and you can can probably make some dough with the arrangement, but it's a completely different business model. If you're considering rejecting the deal, first review possible alternatives that could make the arrangement more to your liking and reduce the client concentration risk. Push hard to make it the right deal for you, because worst case, the deal and relationship fall apart and you're back to being an agency. What's really the worst case to rejecting the deal? You go get more work elsewhere, and there's plenty of that to go around. 

4) **Proposal an alternative arrangement**. 

Counteroffers could be:  
a) Tweaking any proposed terms or items listed in the rest of this answer.  
b) Insist on the ability to take on other work. It'd be in your best interest to have as few restrictions as possible.   
c) Make sure you get paid and handsomely.    
d) They buy you out. They'll going to be taking 100% of your agency bandwidth, and why not just acquire you? 

I hope this helps you think through your options.

> So, I just started my agency 4 weeks ago. A lot of this won't apply to me, but I'll raise objections to these anyway.   


>If they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Look at the worst ones and see how the agency responds. If they did not respond, ask them to explain what happened.  
IF they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Be suspicious

I don't have any reviews. Doesn't mean I'm bad. I've worked in Meta and several other big tech brands as well as running ads for my own startup.

Not having reviews or not means very little. Most business owners/marketing teams are too busy to leave reviews. Then you have agencies like KlientBoost, who I know for a fact, who pays for reviews.   


>Look at how they do their own advertised services for themselves. If they are a web developer, how is their website? If they run ads, find their ads on Facebook Ad Library or Google Searches by searching the agency names. Do they come up? What's the quality like?

I don't know if ads are any good just by looking at them, so I'm not sure how you would gain any insight from that. We don't know how they're doing their retargeting, how those ads are delivered, which part of the funnel they're being delivered to, etc... 

We can make assumptions based on copy and design with what little information we have, but I would say making assumptions isn't very effective in the majority of situations--especially with little context. 

In fact, it's well-known that B2B champions and decision makers start the procurement process through social by speaking to their peers--dark social. So depending on the target deal size and service complexity, it might be beneficial to not run ads at all and instead focus on content.   


>Look at their previous work and case studies on their website. Do they have them? Check out the companies they mentioned. Look at how that company is doing the services the agency claims to provide. Is it well done?

Case studies are low-hanging fruit with dramatic results. They aren't peer-reviewed. Not an effective way to demonstrate expertise nor judge it. There is an exception here--progress over time. It's also best if they can provide rationale. Multiple wins over an extended period of time which shows that they deliver beyond low-hanging fruits and can do more than push buttons.   


>Look to see if the agency is organized and follows structured methods. Ask to see their SOPs, also known as standard operations procedures, to see if they have one. Do they have a clear system for getting started and taking you through the processes? How do they manage their client relationship? How do they know that they are failing you?

I don't have anything to argue here. This is clearly necessary. But how really just how detailed are those SOPs? Also is there an emphasis on strategic thinking? Because I worked at a large international agency, and that's what people lacked most.

> But tea leaves aside, what you really want to do here (like any good consultant :) is to ask lots of questions. Like so: "So, I'm very excited about this opportunity! But since I've never worked in consultancy, I'm just trying to build up a picture of how you all work here.

**Client**: who's the commissioning client (level / role)? who do you liaise with day-to-day? what's their budget? what typically leads them to work with you in the first place? 

**Competition**: who do you compete against for these contracts? Who are the hardest competitors to beat? Why?

**Case**: what's the typical scope? What's the largest / smallest project you ever worked on? What are 'deliverables'? Who approves them? How much do you usually iterate? Describe the 'ideal' project for your firm - what made it ideal? Now describe the 'not great' version - what made it suck?

**Core competencies**: what makes your firm suited to the type of work it does? how would clients describe it?

**Collaboration**: how do you work with the client? what is the best possible setup? what's a bad setup? (how close is the 'usual' to best / worst?)

**Case team**: who's on the team? What are their levels and backgrounds? Where do you like to hire from (firms, universities, backgrounds)? Are they dedicated to one project / multiple projects? -- What's a 'typical day' like when you're on a project? What's a typical day like when you're 'on the beach' (not staffed on a project)?

**Commercials**: How do you win new business? How do pitches work (custom? standardised-ish?) Who wins new contracts? And how will you be involved? --  How do make money (billable hours? deliverables? all-inproject fee?). How do you price your services? Are clients price-sensitive? 

Now ideally don't turn this into an interrogation, but make sure you get good answers in the course of a conversation. Read between the lines, and try to build up a picture of a typical day, and that of a bad day.

(Top tip: joining as a manager / director? ask to have a chat with one of the more junior team members, and get answers to the same questions. Read between the lines ofc, but you should get a really solid read)

> When I worked at a firm, our receptionist did most the things you are talking about, and honestly, it frees up the attorneys and paralegals to do their work. When she quit, we had to alternate paralegals to answer the phones. I often had to get the door. They never hired a new receptionist, and it was the #1 complaint of everyone working there. You will get more tasks as you are there longer but I can promise you those basic tasks really do free up the staff to do the work clients psy for.

> One letter, be done with it. 

Dear Accountant, 

As I've explained several times, lawyers just like accountants have ethical obligations with respect to clients and service. Lawyers are unable in any way to provide referral fees to non-lawyers. Period. The rule is [linked here.](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_5_4_professional_independence_of_a_lawyer/) The answer would have been the same if you brought this up two years ago. 

I'm disappointed that I have to keep reiterating that your proposal is flatly unethical and against my professional conduct guidelines. I can be disbarred and lose my entire livelihood, regardless how you proposed to structure the transaction. Structuring a financial transaction to obscure its purpose is also a problem for accounting professionals, as no doubt you are aware.

Best of luck to you in your business.

> Oh!  $10?  Maybe that makes a difference.  I was thinking of what I've read / had to do with the free level of service.

Not to quibble, but you said = google voice told me...    in a chat / call?  Or a web page?  In general I am disappointed in most EVERY business and it's a running joke with my wife - ask a question and get an answer.  Ask someone else at the company and get a different answer.  and rarely, if you ask a 3rd person there, that you get a same answer as a tie breaker.

and you mention google voice isn't offering a permanent number.... not sure of the interface, but you don't want a number they offer you.  You want to port in your number and THAT will be a permanent number.

Down a rabbit hole..... I googled $10 google voice and got told it's called starter:

**A Google Voice $10 price point refers to the Google Voice Starter plan for businesses, which costs $10 per user, per month, but requires a separate** [**Google Workspace**](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1111US1111&cs=0&sca_esv=8e23599b05dcda53&sxsrf=AE3TifP68a2Edmh1KvZGLTSShAIkIk7abw%3A1756135883196&q=Google+Workspace&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5mr_7o6aPAxVkGVkFHQyVCZsQxccNegQIAhAC&mstk=AUtExfDznIP8V4VA6cTlBrF_B8bIQ0MHsf-bfqCdsPnXZUz5jnGlmwSZyZJSFJGekL0ot-2Sh6XENXEP4N3KKYey74Tgzk0HGidG6KgEJAXZhh2shPJKznQRK3h8YBy8W_dSwmwvnnYEgTjAmJWh5iju4Xc8YuAfYzVUMKddkQ8qHBQsN38Di82460ixmaDKJRdKAk-olwTZtfEXjNpOb-FFz4NEBcDKDisSP7q26HrPxgTk46Yhj-mmBNYbDkjJ6nbrVBlBJ3K41SWSC-adF6wm3yQkkQTpWfN6HdVMppzIGuUlRw&csui=3) **subscription, starting at $6-$7 per month, to be used.** 

Googling google voice starter plan port in, I get:

**You cannot port a number into the Starter plan for Google Voice. Number porting is only available for Google Voice for Business plans, which require a Google Workspace account, not the individual, free, or paid plans of personal Google Voice. You will need to set up a business account to port a number into Google Voice.** 

So that's wrong at least on this:....  number porting IS available on the personal / individual plans.

And starter?  There's a personal version (you are on?) and business?

That's googling / AI answers about a GOOGLE service.  

I get soooo frustrated at the inability to get accurate answers from companies.   perfect example here - you will likely get more accurate info from someone (seems like it won't be from me... sorry!) here rather than google's own pages.

### r/VOIP — 2025-03-30 | 2pts

> THE ISSUES: 

We get no coordination between phones, one phone will ring and the other won't acknowledge a call ever happened. Our call histories are completely different, even after waiting a day and signing out and in we can never get anything to match. Better yet, you can't even seem to delete a simple text message from the application when you want to, instead receiving an error message that it's unable to be deleted. 

The voicemail is a huge disappointment. There's no voicemail box that can be accessed from both phones via the app. Instead one user gets the voicemail and the other gets an email with the voicemail attached. I could live with that except the voicemail is attached in .wav format which is not supported by any extension in existence on google chrome so every voicemail needs to be downloaded to just listen to it. 

Text messaging (we have our 10 DLC registration) seems to decide on whether it will work or not day by day. Sometimes messages send, sometimes they don't, but they always show they sent on my end just adding to the confusion and irritation. I end up often having to give customers my personal number so that we can effectively communicate. The entire reason I have a VoIP is to just use one number and now we have customers that have three numbers, exactly what I wanted to absolutely avoid! 

Don't even get me started on the Bluetooth connectivity with vehicles, it's bizarre. If I had been on a call at and get into my vehicle at a later time, long after the call has ended my vehicle Bluetooth thinks there is a phone call in process. But there is no phone call and the only way to get my phone to connect correctly is to completely restart my phone, closing the Nextiva app doesn't have an affect at all.

Worst yet is the scenario when I try to answer a call while connected to Bluetooth. When I pick up, the music lowers volume but does not stop or turn off completely. It continues to play via the car speakers but sounds as if it is playing through the phone speakers (poor audio quality) at the same time the callers voice comes through the speakers as the music continues to play but at a very low volume (even when volume is all the way up). I have no idea if the caller can hear the music on their side but its impossible for me to hear them anyways so I have to be sure to turn off Bluetooth before taking a Nextiva call. When taking a phone call on my actual phone, none of these issues exist. 

This has happened on both my Galaxy S20 Ultra and my new Galaxy S22 Ultra (just upgraded a couple weeks ago) so it's not a phone issue. Making things EVEN worst is the fact that I have "Number Garage" another VoIP service on my phone for another business that I do not own but manage. That VoIP and application that costs a FRACTION of what Nextiva costs seems to work flawlessly with little to no issues in comparison. 

Now I am unsure on what direction to go in, I've been researching other VoIPs but hesitant to make any decision because I a

### r/LawFirm — 2026-01-04 | 7pts

> Paralegal here. Also former tech analyst, been following tech and AI for 25+ years.

Here's the fundamental problem with "AI" as we know it today. In the efforts to build a system that is "predictive/generative" (e.g. capable of guessing or "creating"), tech has somewhat intentionally moved to a model where probability is more important than accuracy. 

Let's look at something as basic as spell checking. It used to be that you'd choose a "dictionary" for spell checking in word processors like Microsoft Word. This meant that if you were (for example) in the legal profession, you could install a legal dictionary that had specific phrases (e.g. Latin) and spellings that conformed to your specific needs. If you were in a doctor's office, you could put in a medical dictionary instead. This reduced both spelling errors and the "false positives" you get when spelling something correctly according to YOU but not what the "spell checker" thought was incorrect.

That went away.

Then instead of flagging the error, we had "auto-correct" everywhere. So now, the computer simply assumes that when I type something, that it knows **better** than me, so it changes it. My favorite current example of this is how on the Mac, when you type b) (as in... a) b) c) it will auto-correct it to the sunglasses smiley emoji. It will do this even when I click the little X to say "don't do that", meaning I have to CMD-Z then right arrow to get away from the highlight, all to get... exactly what I typed.

Now, we have "predictive text" where increasingly, products assume they can predict what I want to say. Usually, it's not too bad, but occasionally, it results in errors in *meaning* that I have to correct. Not at all what I want.

So let's look at the particular problem of redacting medical records. Keep in mind that AI is designed to **approximate** thoroughness not actually achieve it. What's weird is that if you took a "non-AI" approach to redacting (for example) SSNs, it should be pretty easy:

>Flag any string of nine digits, including if they are separated by dashes or spaces. If the string starts with a 9, 000, or 666, flag it separately.

That is an "old school" (computing-wise) way of stringing absolute yes/no queries together to form a near foolproof search. 

**But that's not how tech is doing searches anymore.**

So, when I open a PDF in Acrobat, I'm literally bombarded with efforts to get me to use "AI" when all I want to do is easily search for and redact information, then properly Bates number and produce. 

To be honest, it's not the process of manually redacting that is "killing" me as a paralegal; it is the constant and unwanted changes to functionality and interface that big tech companies (looking mostly at you Adobe and Microsoft, but Apple and Google suck nearly as much) insist on making to critical software. 

I'm sure I'll be criticized as "biased" since as a "paralegal," my job is "threatened by AI," but... I'm not worried at all. My SAs trust me to pr

> PI cases take a while to settle. It's unfortunately not as simple as sending a bunch of demand letters and waiting for the money to come in. 

- You can get a settlement offer from an insurance company, but most of the time it'll be too low. It won't cover the medical bills, especially once your fee gets taken out. So the only way to get the offer to go up so it's reasonable (ie an offer the client will accept that'll cover the meds) is to file. Once you're filing, the litigation is a time-consuming waste of time. Most litigated cases get settled without going to trial, but you'll still end up doing discovery on a lot of PI cases. Tons of ATIs. PI litigation is very formulaic, the interrogatories are always the same (describe the accident, client's injuries etc) but managing litigation deadlines in a PI firm with a lot of cases is hard. The law isn't hard, but there's an art to doing PI well and it takes time. 

- Support staff is absolutely CRITICAL in PI. The best PI lawyers are the ones that have good support staff. Staff make or break a firm in any field, but esp in PI. A lot of lawyers don't really work on PI cases, it's the staff doing all the work. You don't just need staff that answer phones, you need staff that are super resilient and will stick around despite clients yelling at them 24/7 cuz they want their money immediately.

**Pros of PI:**

- No billables

- Easy to find car crash cases in a major city

- Can make decent money 

- Don't have to hound clients to get them to make a payment

- Unless the client was in PT for 6 months+, these cases don't have much paperwork. You're not dealing with 50 exhibits and 2000 pages that often. Most records & bills can be sent/uploaded electronically, which is easier to deal with.

- Don't have to go to trial that often

- Basically zero legal research or motions. If you hated Lexis/Westlaw & case briefing, PI doesn't do any of that

**Cons of PI:**

- **The clients are the WORST.** Aside from family law, PI clients are the most insufferable. They're insanely demanding and will call your office every day demanding updates every hour, and they're completely ungrateful. PI clients think *you* owe *them*, when in reality clients wouldn't get a penny from insurance without us. Clients always think PI cases will get resolved in 1 week, when they actually can take 1-2 years. They think their lawyer will just send a scary letter and insurance will give them $1m. Seriously, PI clients are awful. Pay your staff well, cuz having to deal with some of the worst clients imaginable all day is a really hard job. PI firms can burn through staff quickly cuz the clients are so demanding, and nothing's ever good enough for them. Even when we literally work for free and then give them money. 

- **PI's really redundant.** The cases are all really similar, if you're looking for excitement and variety this isn't the field for you. Sometimes you can get a big case with some serious injuries, but those are like 5% of y

> What's your practice area, and what size of city are you in?

When I started out the only thing that worked right away was Google Ads. I made less on those files, but made sure to get good reviews. Within a year I was top of the map pack in my practice area for my city (smallish city). You can and should optimize your Google listing. They let you post updates, and seem to like it. So add some updates about your services and you should climb quick. Also, always ask for a review (unless you mess things up -- in which case I always [only happened once] give full refund and complete work).

I have an SEO guy now. I went through SO MANY, it was frustrating. But finding a good one was worth it. I would strongly caution against a falt-fee or retainer model -- they just pump out AI slop. I pay hourly and we have targets in mind (organic clicks). SEO is pretty great once it's done right, but it does take forever, and I spent way too much on what probably weren't technically scams, but that felt that way. 

I tried to make FB ads work. They are so cheap, but I could never convert them. 

Oh, and here's the industry standard as far as I know for setting calls. You need a receptionist. It's a free consultation to speak to the receptionist, who bills CC for a paid intake call with you. Don't speak to clients for free, or they essentially never close (unless your PI, I don't know how that works). You can get an assistant/receptionist part time, just post on indeed. But you will have to figure out payroll if you do.

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.

I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).

1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;

2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc’s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I’m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it’s not a lot, but I’m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she’s a part of my life now. 10/10

***Extra bonus: she thinks I’m too skinny and brings in donuts. 

****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I’m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I’ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).

3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn’t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally t

> I'm a PI lawyer, and I have been us⁤ing a virtual receptionist (real people) for the last three years.

It took a few weeks for them to get things really dialed in, and there was some upfront work. But after that, it was incredibly worth it. 

It especially helps when I increase my marketing and need help with calls. 

Financially it makes a ton of sense. If they even capture a handful of cases a month, you make many times your money back. 

Especially helpful in practice areas where speed to lead is crucial. Also, steer clear of AI at all costs, or you'll regret it. Hope this helps.

> As someone who was at a small firm way longer than I should have been, the equal bonus amongst staff was always leaving me on a sour note. As the highest biller (sometimes bringing in more than senior attorneys) and getting the same bonus as the file clerk and receptionist - it made me feel like I was being taken advantage of. It also felt horrible when law clerks and associates would get sometimes a bonus that equaled a partner share - when a lot of their billable hours were written off and mine was always charged. Not to mention - no raises. 

I always felt that a holiday bonus could be an equal bonus amongst staff and a separate bonus based on productivity and value of the work. 

When a senior paralegal is drafting motions, obtaining and handling discovery, monitoring deadlines, preparing for hearings, attending trials, etc., a lot of the time working long hours, while others are less stressed, working exact hours and shopping online during work hours and getting an equal bonus - it makes the paralegal feel undervalued and taken advantage of. 

Remember - a good paralegal is worth its weight - I know I would go above and beyond when I felt appreciated but once I started to feel like just any employee - I stopped putting in an effort. Paralegals are not paid as well as attorneys so bonuses do send a message that you see their worth. 

Just my thoughts!

> TL;DR: You can go solo and there are TONS of ways to do so! 

  
Meh. It depends. You can work up to an easy solo "Ronin" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  

You can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do "DSS Defense" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).

The worst part (for me) is the "running a business" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a "brick and mortar" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that "Gen-X Joke" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  


The #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  


14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case! (e.g., I helped a little old lady change her birth certificate and went to Dept. of Vital Stats with her and sat for 3 hours to get it done. I didn't make money, but it is good client relations and it helped someone!)

> We use Axacore to provide some of our online fax services and have had similar issues with it and is part of the reason we are leaving them. Fax is very very finnicky, and long faxes (faxes with lots of pages / high detail) are even harder. Since your service is through them, there's not much you can do that would impact fax reliability. The replies from your Axacore vendor don't seem very helpful and don't explain the high rate of failure.

I'd maybe look at other companies that offer online fax service in your area, 50% of faxes failing is a huge issue. There's also a handful of large online fax providers that you could use (there's a monthly requests thread if you want more info that you could ask there)

In the mean time, I'd be hammering the Dialog support to get answers on why you're having so many issues. You could use HP's Fax Service to send some test faxes to 1-888-HPFaxme (1-888-473-2963 U.S.) and see what happens. If it fails, contact the support and ask them why, and keep testing and pushing them until they fix it or you can find an alternative. I know this would be super frustrating to me if I couldn't get a solution when something is failing 50% of the time, and since you're sending medical faxes it's even more important they get sent timely.

> cell providers are (at least Verizon and AT&T)  flagging tons of businesses as spam that are not. 

You say you have a verizon MVNO, even if you replicated the issue you are out of luck.  They will not, cannot,  help you.  

You need a test line with one or all of the big 3 that is having the issue.  NVNO do not have the ability to escalate tickets to people who can help.  That is the point of the NVNO, that is why they are cheap.

Threaten your provider with moving to a different carrier. 

If they can't help, then look at the cost to move to a big carrier.  

Verizon business isn't absolutely awful, not fantastic, and customers get lost in the shuffle, and maybe don't get the best support on issues.  

Get a sales quote from a couple providers.  Take that to your provider.  Tell them to fix it or you are going to cancel.

Your provider may do some poor practices, like not validate calling numbers against their customers accounts, thus allowing a customer to outpulse any number they want.  This is a big no no.  They might have a large number of customers with auto dialers.  Could be lots of things.  It could be the big companies are using stir shaken as an excuse to screw over small low cost providers by rating their trust as low and flagging calls as spam.

Track all the issues you have, emails, and support calls to your provider.  If you are under contract you will need maybe six or so attempts at working with your provider documented to get out of paying ETF for breaking any contracts you are under.  Contracts can always be broken, you just need examples of how the provider is not providing a quality service.  It doesn't matter that caller id is not guaranteed or that service quality is not in the contract.  Any provider giving bad service will let you out of a contract rather than deal with government fines.

If you really want to keep your provider then file a complaint with your states utility commission.  Every state has one or more departments that take resident complaints about utilities.  And these departments have POWER.  Providers mess with them and suddenly no permits for doing any work on poles, no permits for expansions. 

If you have documented tickets and they want to charge ETF, a report to the FTC will clear that up immediately.  You need good documented tickets.  You need to work with your provider in good faith. If they call you back, answer the calls.  If they want test calls then you make them.  Filing a complaint is not a free service/pay no fees card.

You can complain to the FCC's consumer complaint.  Last I knew these were slower to get worked due to the volume of reports they get.  I know some really nice helpful people at the FCC, but waiting weeks for your ticket to reach the top of the que sucks.

> They are out there but they'll make up an extremely small percentage of your clients. It's always funny when you make a post like this and the majority of the comments are from randoms saying "The problem is you! If you on board better all your clients will be perfect and pay you forever and never become a bad client!" Those people must not live in the real world, and must not own an agency because it's simply not true. 

  
The truth is, most clients are a nightmare. I recently had a client who I gelled with very much. Everything going great, lead volume up and costs down month after month. One day, out of the blue, he emails me and says "We need to pause everything after this month, we're putting our marketing money somewhere else" 

The last day of our service, he goes in and flips my campaign back on that I turned off. He just wanted to run our ads and not pay us to manage them. 

Then you have the clients where you think everything is going well, you're meeting your goals consistently. Providing WEEKLY reporting that proves it, and their friend who lives on the other side of the country looks at their ads and says "I know someone who can do it better than your current agency" BOOM - you're fired instantly without a single second of notice. 

Then you'll have the ones who hire their niece who's in high school to follow up with the leads. She calls the leads one time, 2 weeks after the lead signed up, lead doesn't answer the phone. Then little suzy goes and tells the owner of the business the leads suck. BOOM! Fired!

Or how about Mr Pest control company that hires your agency to rank them on page one of Google, you fulfill your promise and rank them on page one for ALL their keywords. Then you get the email, hey thanks for getting us ranked! We need to pause for a month and we'll get back to this. BOOM! Fired and ghosted. 

  
Or what about the client that hires you, and when you're building out there campaign, you go into the Google drive folder that you gave them a week ago to upload images and videos to be used for ads. The folder's empty, you email the client and ask for content. She says she will provide it next week. Next week the folder is still empty. You email her again and remind her you need content. She emails you back and says she's 33 weeks pregnant and doesn't feel like dealing with this. She says she's paying you enough money and you should be able to find content yourself (stock photos). You reply and tell her that we can of course use stock photos, but the ads won't perform as well that way. She replies and tells you that she wants a refund. 

  
These are just a couple examples of what we deal with on a weekly basis. For anyone blaming you and saying that all clients are perfect and will pay you on time every month with no complaints until they day the die so long as your onboarding call was up to par, doesn't actually have significant clients and has probably worked with a couple clients as a side gig over the course of th

> Hi there! Just a quick note upfront - I'm with LEX Reception, but I promise to keep this purely informational.  
  
When evaluating answering services, here are a few things to consider, no matter which provider you choose:  
  
Legal-Specific Intake - The person answering your calls should be familiar with legal terminology and processes to ensure smooth communication with your clients.  
  
Real People - Check if the service provides real people or AI receptionist. I'm biased on this one because we truly believe a real person answering a call provides a better first impression than AI (we have data to prove it!).  
  
Integrations That Work For You - Look for services that allow direct scheduling. This eliminates frustrating back-and-forth - securing a higher commitment from the potential new client. Integration with your CRM or case management system also cuts down on admin.  
  
Overflow and Routing - The provider should offer flexible routing options and help you with best practices that align with your firm's protocols. Check that they make it easy to toggle availability as your schedule changes between meetings or deep focus work.    
  
Tone Consistency- Callers should always feel like they’re speaking to your practice. The answering service should provide a custom script to maintain consistency and offer expertise in helping to craft it.  
  
Hope that helps! More than happy to talk through in more detail.

It is a complex issue with 4 years of email evidence.  There are also many different complaints. Since I have no experience in law other than what I have seen in TV and Movies, I would like to organize my case before meeting with potential attorney's so I can present my case to them in a way that I will be heard and be able to share it in a way that they can understand.  With consultations costing $175 for 30 mins.  I don't want to waste my time rushing through a long story.

I do not need it for anything other than this one case. I want to be able to upload all of my files and it be my legal assistant (like many programs offer). Does anyone know of a place that offers this?  If so, one that offers it at a reasonable price?  I appreciate any input.

> It’s probably not an outright scam in that they probably do offer you some amount of education and get you placed in some sort of training position somewhere. It’s not really a scam if they deliver the services you paid for.

The real question is whether or not what they can offer is valuable, and the answer is probably not unless you can’t get a similar experience from just getting an internship yourself, which it sounds like you already did.

They probably don’t have anything unique to teach you that you couldn’t learn somewhere else or maybe even for free just by reading what people share on this sub. And obviously a financial consulting “bootcamp” isn’t going to carry any prestige. Bootcamps are great for people with no tech experience who want to break into tech, but finance is such a different industry I can’t see anyone really respecting that or being impressed by it.

It’s probably not worth the cost. If it were really that great he probably wouldn’t be sending cold emails to fill the classes. If it was that prestigious and useful they’d probably have plenty of inbound leads coming to them and not need to do cold outreach.

I would avoid.

>The one complaint I have heard from the locals is that westerners always get paid more even if the local consultant has similar qualification. ( I.e. graduated from a western university.) is that accurate?

Yes.  We are affected by client wishes, contracts, cost benefit, and heavily by market rates.  My Lao consultants with AUS undergrad degrees and 8-10 years of experience are making about $45 - $50k a year, which is high for the local professional services market.  My Lao consultant with a US degree and ADB experience is making about $62k.  My US folks are $200k+

However, we only have ONE US long-termer who is the face of our project.  I honestly wanted to get rid of him and go all short-termers for international experts but the client refused, they want a foreign, non SE Asian face full-time, even if its not as effective.  

>In addition, could projects like these implemented by westerners perpetuate perceptions that only Europeans are competent administrators/policy makers ( rather than locals)?

This is an issue that depends on the country. In Laos, they want an expat face (Skin color doesn't matter as long as they are from a Western country and exude it) to help drive decisions and to be able to take the blame when shit goes wrong.  Its not just developing countries that had this but advanced nations like Korea that wanted a non-regional voice that could express NO and pushback but could also be the catalyst to finally make a freaking decision.  No one wants to be the nail that sticks out because no one wants to get hammered down - the expat is suppose to take this role and responsibility.  Expats can be more "expendable" - I can fire and replace them easily.  Guess who I can't replace easily- my local consultants who went to western schools.  Why?  Their father is the vice minister of X or their uncle is the Governor of Y or... basically in a small community, these people are connected.

Is it still heavily Western based?  Yes, especially if you add all ethnicities and throw in HKG, Korea, Japan, Singapore, maybe even Malaysia and middle income kingdoms into the mix.  My clients in Bangladesh love me some MENA consultants who can play consultants on TV.  I can take South Asians to TImor-LEste to help build their port.  Former Petro experts from Kazahkstan to Indonesia?  No problem.  

Basically, the best consultants I can sell are those who have designed and implemented successful solutions in many different countries and situations before and can walk everyone through lessons learned and a strategy/vision that is based on actual wins and losses.  

Does this help answer?  Of course there are issues with race sometimes but it also seems rooted in nationality.  I'd have a very difficult time fielding a qualified West AFrican consultant for some clients in Ukraine but an Afri

> > this is going to be pricey? to go to VOIP?

No, why would you think that?  Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).

Phones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.

Another thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as "line 1" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.

Usually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with "unlimited" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.

It sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.

If you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.

If your users actually want fax or want "Line 1/2/3" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.
