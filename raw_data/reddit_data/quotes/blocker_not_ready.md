> I searched through my post history to find my response to a similar post a few years ago. I graduated 10 years ago and also had a ton of trouble getting my first job.

>In Canada, where I live, you are required to article before you can be called to the bar - basically a 10 month apprenticeship with a qualified lawyer.  
  
What worked for me - made a huge lists of firms in my city that I was interested in. Sent out a personalized cover letter with a copy of my transcript, resume, and references to the most senior person at each firm. In my email I said I would follow up with a call next week. Probably sent out 50 -75 applications this way. Then I’d follow up each day with a telephone call to the firms on my list, crossing out the ones that weren’t interested.  
  
Some were rude but most were surprising nice and were happy to chat. Some recommended other firms or put me in touch with other lawyers they thought might be hiring. Some agreed to meet me for a cup of coffee just to chat. I got 3-4 interviews from firms that had no plans to hire but liked my application and my enthusiasm. I botched a couple of them but all you need is one. I ended up articling at a 10 lawyer firm with a solid reputation. It ended up being a horrible place to work but I got called and then moved on to better things.  
  
Everyone that met with me said they got dozens of resumes a week but I was the only one that actually called (and called continuously). One lawyer who never answered his phone eventually agreed to meet me if I would stop calling him (he never told me to stop, was just screening my calls).  
  
At the time I was searching for articles there was an articling crisis like never before - a lot of new grads couldn’t get jobs. With the shortfall in articling positions it meant every job posting had hundreds of applicants. I found this was a good way to get myself in front of some firms that weren’t even interviewing anyone else.

&#x200B;

A couple other comments on reflection:

1. While I applied to job postings, I didn't focus so much on those - I figured they were getting hundreds of other applicants who were also vying for their attention. Looking back I don't know if it would have been better to focus more on these firms or not.
2. Articling students generally aren't paid a ton -  I wonder if this factored into my ability to get interviews with firms that weren't actively hiring. Like taking me on wasn't going to be a big expense. 
3. I spent an insane amount of time perfecting my covering letter and resume. I had heard that any mistake in them was reason for a potential employer to pass on me. Now I hire articling students and employees myself - I barely glance at the cover letter and just care about the substance of the resume. I don't eliminate anyone for minor formatting or other errors. Maybe if we had hundreds of qualified applications I would though? I did get at least 2 interviews from lawyers that really liked the writing in my cover let

> # Looking for best home VOIP service with an ethernet phone that I won't lose control of my phone number.

I am hoping for some help and guidance. I still have a landline number that I, from a career in the wireless industry, know is my property via number portability and I want to keep this number. For years I have had my number at Vonage and am getting sick of the $35/month bill for a number that is basically parked and forwarded to my cellphone number.

That said, there are some changes in my home setup now as I have been working from home for the last 4 years and my work desk phone is here on my desk for conference calls and other calls I make via ethernet to my internet connection (Verizon Fios). My company has used Nextiva, but is sick of paying the bill and is ditching the desk phones and going all computer MS Teams for communications/calls.

What I am looking for is to have a business-feature/style phone on my desk with my landline number. I would like to use the VoIP ethernet connection I have set up. I researched this a couple of years ago and liked the SNOM phones (like the D735). I would like to get to a cheaper VoIP service where they can't steal my phone number from me (I have heard that Nextiva and Google Voice have done this to people). I don't need fancy features for VoIP service, just unlimited (or a high minute number) minutes, ability to forward to my cellphone when I don't answer my desk phone, and VM I guess. Open to VoIP provider and phone maker suggestions. Thanks!

> >Does this mean we're never, ever able to recommend businesses or alternatives when posters ask questions? 

You are 100% allowed to recommend businesses when replying to requests in the monthly requests thread.

Otherwise if someone asks "How do I do X with provider Y?" and you respond with "You should use provider Z instead", you are breaking the rules.

If someone is looking for help solving a specific problem, it is never acceptable to recommend alternatives. It **is** however perfectly fine to say "this is a problem inherent to Service XYZ. The only solution is to change providers." This answers the question without promoting any particular competitor.

&#x200B;

>the way you are thinking of doing this is way overkill, I would recommend going with \[insert name of commonly used Voip service\] for this 

Is the "overkill" solution *the only way to do it* within the OP's ecosystem? If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say "Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider. If you want a different solution you will have to find a new business to work with."

&#x200B;

> So we're never allowed to mention names of Voip services, SIP apps, number parking services, etc. etc. outside of the quarantined threads? Is that what I'm reading? 

No. Discussions of business, services and products is not only allowed, but encouraged. The only stipulation is that it must be *on topic* and not promotional.

For example:

Someone asks "Which of these three PBXs can be integrated with Provider XYZ?"

Here is a good reply:

"XYZ Telecom, VoIP Provider W, and ABC123 all work. I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\_to\_website or you will have a bad time."

Here is a bad reply:

"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support"

One of them answers the question ("Which can be integrated?") while also giving helpful insight ("some settings misbehave"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.

If on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment" is fine, because the API requiring PHP

> First of all thanks for commenting and to the other person on this comment chain what you already discussed with eachother has been helpful.

I think you answered most of my question even though I didn't express myself clearly. Let me clarify:

There's 2 things I want to know:

- How in general consultants tackle multiple clients and is my situation unqiue or are there other approaches (i.e you secure contract work that is billed per devliberable/project instead of daily rates comes to my mind.. as then you can just focus on the deliverable instead of billable hours and you don't need to worry how you juggle things as long as the work is done or what you suggested.. tracking 20 hours or however much your worked and saying you're unavailable the rest of the day etc. if you have work with another client or some 3rd approach which i dont know about etc.)

I'm asking this quesiton because either I'm doing something wrong or I have unrealistic expecations for what actually is consultant work, so I needed more clarity on that. If my situation is pretty standard and most clients need you to be dedicated the typical 40hours per week and you're billed per hours worked on their project then consultancy is probably not for me as I'd rather get the benefits of being a fulltime employee. For me the idea of consultancy is to be able to offer a service and have multiple clients (as long as you can deliver to all of them) and not be billed on hours worked but rather on results and deliverables, in fact you should be rewarded if you can deliver something faster with the same quality.

- The second question is regarding my specific scenario which to be honest is also not fully clear to me... I haven't actually started work on the project. On the one side we're talking about a project that is say 9months long fixed-term with a target deliverable, on the other side they want me to track billable hours and pay me on that. 

I'm sorry but if I'm ready with all deliverables at the 3 month mark, why would i deliver it then if im being payed by the hour? Wether I stretch my work hours to be longer to collect a full pay check, or just be a perfectionist so everything takes me twice as long, there is no incentive to actually complete the work as fast as possible.This is why I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. 

What you said if I do have a second client is what I'll do - be upfront about it with the first hour and tell them I won't be available for meetings with them if I'm already busy and in meetings with the second client OR if they're really expecting me to be 8hours dedicated all day to them I'll simply decline any adittional clients as I wouldn't have the capacity for both and I'll probably look for another altenrative path in the future.. either billing per project or something else.

My intention is not to short any client, that's the whole point of the post, if I wanted to do that I wouldn't be asking for permission or discussing it online, it's more so to unde

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> Not the answer you're looking for: let your portable devices be portable devices and your office workstations be office workstations. 

Since you don't need (expensive) GPUs, a decent midrange desktop will curbstomp a laptop four times it's cost.

Dinky pathetic laptops with slow professors and tiny screens often have much, much better battery life.

Set up a network drive for each pair of systems (lappy and desk) and some type of synchronization for anything that doesn't cover.


It'll cost less overall, be far more serviceable down the road (working on desktop hardware is a cakewalk), and when the laptops inevitably croak first, you have a working system AND less money tied up in the more disposable portable one. 


If you were a huge firm maybe it wouldn't be worth the electricity premium but for a two person firm this is the way.

> In general, there is no single trick for making it work. Rather, think of it as a dozen buckets you set out to catch slow drips of clients. It might feel disappointing to put out a new "facebook page" bucket and not see immediate returns, but when you have dozens of trickles of phone calls it really adds up. 

**Here's what has worked for my EP clients:**

1. Solid SEO on your website. Make sure it's well set-up. However I doubt ongoing SEO will be valuable unless you happen to live in a city where few other EP firms are making an effort. Instead consider the following: 

1a) Write blog posts that answer common EP questions. Most people search in the form of questions. If you have a blog post that is phrased the same as their question, along with the answer, then you'll likely get a call here and there.

1b) Write blog posts that answer uncommon questions. A single blog post that answers a question no other law firm has answered will reliably generate calls for years. 

2. Facebook page - have a facebook page and a way to keep it updated every week or so. The "freshness" shows you are active and hard working. The page itself isn't going to attract new clients, but it is one of the things people check on when researching you. 

3. YELP - Don't bother advertising with yelp, but do have a business listing and work hard to get a few 5-star reviews from your clients.  Again, this won't attract new clients but lots of people research there, so you want to have a good rating. 

4. Google business listing - Probably your most important listing. Call friends, family, and anybody who might give you a good review and get a few on there. One very important aspect of this tool is to ask people to specifically mention "estate planning lawyer" or some other variation of what you do. Google treats this like gospel and if everybody in your reviews is saying you're great with estate plans, it is way more likely to show you to people looking online. 

5. Youtube - Again, it's unlikely a video of yours will result in calls (but it can happen), but I am always surprised at the number of clients who say "I was researching you and saw your video about...." You don't have to go crazy, just have a channel and a handful of videos that let you introduce yourself and the firm by perhaps answering a few questions, or describing the EP process for new clients. 

All of that is possible to do for free yourself. Here's the paid stuff:

6. Do a few online searches and see who and what already ranks for your key phrases. For example, if stupid AVVO ranks #1 for "estate plan lawyer" then consider trying out a listing on AVVO for a while and see if it generates calls.  If they don't appear, then don't waste your money. Some jurisdictions will have random sites like "thumbtack,' or "ELocal" or some other small-time directory show up #1. If they rank well in your area, try them out.  

7. Paid lead services - paid lead services can work, but are usually overpriced and often do not wo

> RE: OpenAI o3

The current stage is a proof of concept, but it's a real threat because OpenAI has a pedigree of improving performance at lighting speeds. For instance, the distance between GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini was about 14 months, and in that time they reduced resource utilization by like 14X (going by API costs) while maintaining benchmarks and adding features.

In general terms, think of our current stage of AI as 3 components. The pre-processing, the LLM stage, and the controller or post-processing. In the pre-processing, the system understands the prompt and can doctor it and direct it to various modules to service it. For instance, if you ask a math question, the pre-processor can pull out a calculator so the LLM doesn't have to do math. If you ask a particularly difficult question, the system can pull out Python and write itself an algorithm to solve it beyond what a normal calculator could handle. You usually don't see this stuff, it happens in the background.

The LLM stage (the actual language brain) is what we are saying is fairly close to max ability for now. We already fed the architecture all of the world's knowledge and spent years maximizing optimizations. So the current version of GPT-4o, by my guess, is perhaps \~80% as smart at doing language responses as we are going to get without a significant tech breakthrough... for now as of 2024-early 2025.

The controller or post-processing stage has tons of promise. In addition to using the pre-processor to help digest the prompt and introduce fancy modules to crunch data, the controller can run parallel processes to hack at a problem from multiple angles. We know from various tests that an LLM responds better if it has multiple chances at the same question. I've seen research that shows that a low-smarts LLM can answer as well as a smart one if it is allowed to refine its own answer 100 times in the background.

What the o1 and o3 models are doing is taking advantage of this controller / post-processing approach. They are using their smartest model, and then it tries to improve on its own answers by pursuing various iterations. The underlying LLM is still near some form of GPT-4o, but the result you get comes from multiple versions of itself trying to digest the question from multiple angles and then forming a roundtable of copies of the same robot to analyze everything the robot can do to try to come up with a perfect answer.

OpenAI proved with o3 that if you let the machine eat as many resources as it wants, it gets within range of passing the current AGI tests we have available. This doesn't mean that o3 is AGI, it means that our tests were not expecting the robots to get this smart so fast; and we need new tests that are harder and more precise in what they check for. 

o3 is still missing proper self-learning and memory systems. OpenAI is for sure working on this stuff but it's not ready yet. But systems like o3 (the proof of concept), or o1 (the current smartest robot available

### r/VOIP — 2024-03-02 | 1pts | Mentions: **OpenPhone**

> part 2/2:

  
- My Take (again, having never used DIGITS) -



Switching away from providers' CBSS sucks, and that lock-in is what they bank on to keep you as a customer. Were I in your shoes, knowing only what you've put in your original post, I'd consider a few options:



a) ripping that band-aid off, YOLO-ing it and porting the number out. You'll incur downtime of some kind (possibly a week if everything goes right). If you can sync out those contacts into the new system ahead of time, you might not be completely effed (again, message history's gonna be messssssy).



b) starting a new service with a new phone number entirely. Give out the new number to customers and start using it for everything. Keep the old T-Mo service in place for a while, but shift everyone over to the new system. No downtime needed, but wouldn't be a quick process. Annoying and a PITA to maintain two calling/messaging systems, but would incur the fewest "oh shit it's all horribly broken and now so is our business" moments.



c) broadening our scope and looking into more of a CRM than just a calling/texting service. Example: hubspot, while I think can become cost-prohibitive if you're a small shop and try to scale up, integrates with a bunch of calling services (https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/calling). Zoho might be worth considering and integrates with things like RingCentral and Dialpad (I've not used either in a calling capacity, though RC as a company and website has felt a bit heavy/clunky to me). I don't know what you're using to keep track of all your customer interactions (I'm thinking more like the house cleanings, etc, not just calls/messaging), but it could make sense to try to integrate this into a CRM somehow. Might be totally overkill for your needs.



d) look for more a service that offers a true sms inbox. I've seen https://www.openphone.com/ (see https://www.openphone.com/blog/sms-inbox/) recommended elsewhere for calling/voip purposes (never used them, no affiliation). Looks like you can import contacts from a csv https://support.openphone.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500009861242-How-to-import-a-large-number-of-contacts-to-OpenPhone though idk what kind of flexibility/options your business needs. Dialpad I think supports shared sms messaging too (again, no experience with them). Actually, more I look into these pages, the more I think this option might be the right answer. Kinda one of the startup-y companies offering an integrated group call/sms solution with a bunch of purple on their website (cause, you know, it's the hot color right now.....T-Mobile pink is sooooo 2010s lol).



So, that's what I know. Or don't know. Idk. Hope it helps :)

> Client acquisition feeling “easy” makes sense once you’ve actually nailed positioning like you’re talking about. The hard part is that most people think their problem is leads when it’s actually “I have no idea who I’m for or why anyone should pick me.”



What helped me was forcing a one-sentence filter: “I help X type of client do Y specific outcome using Z method.” If you can’t write that in under 15 seconds, you’re not ready for new channels, you’re just going to spray noise.



Once that’s tight, tactics become way more plug-and-play: cold email suddenly works, outbound on Apollo or Clay stops feeling random, podcast guesting makes sense, even lurking and answering questions on Reddit or in DMs turns into a steady pipeline. I’ve used things like LinkedIn Sales Navigator and SparkToro for audience mapping, and Reddit monitoring tools like Pulse alongside others to see what my ICP actually complains about in real time.



Positioning first, everything else is just choosing a lane and driving it consistently.

> I think it mainly depends on what you and your team actually NEED, and what you need the software to do. I have worked in many industries that are very disconnected with little overlap, but almost every single business activity boils down to CRUD: you need a database you can Create, Read, Update and Delete from. Virtually every program and game, etc.; that we use is some kind of abstraction of an "interactive table(s)". For 20+ years I have always had the same job, roughly (outside my forays into other weird work), and that is essentially "make a highly specific and proprietary CRUD".

Customers? Appointments? Installs? Leads? These are all just tables of data and the interplay between them is what can give projects life. Obviously, this is not something you can just whip out if you do not have the skill set which is okay, I am just explaining this in the hopes that maybe you can look at your own processes and see what exactly you need.

The thing that I feel is really insidious about stuff like GHL is when it is also sold as being able to generate leads/sales or do proper lead nurturing. In both cases, they require more resources to get dumped in (advertising dollars in the first, and proper workflows/automations in the second). It isn't that you can't use GHL in any capacity: just that you would light-years ahead of most of your competition if you properly knew what it was and what it was **not** capable of, coupled with what exactly your team needs on a day-to-day basis.

There are also lots of alternatives and that SaaS space is absolutely flooded with options. Invariably, they will all have some shortcomings. Their own pros and cons. Some employees will want (Software Y) they used at their last company and not (Software X) that you end up choosing, which is also inevitable, so it is important to avoid a secondary trap of constantly searching for a solution and thinking that, just beyond the horizon, an oasis awaits. It is always a mirage.

I look at the process (in solar) like this: you have or generate a lead that is interested -> an appointment setter or the sales rep directly gets in contact with them virtually or ideally at their house -> management tracks these interactions very granular to watch for hiccups -> hopefully the deal converts (customer signs) and heads to your installer or you do the install and continue down the process further with customer retention/service, etc.;

The hardest part is the first step. You might end up having to dump a lot of uneasy money into various marketing. The internet does not operate the same way it did even a year ago: SEO got massively disrupted by AI, for example, and advertisements in **any** industry can be a crapshoot (even with highly skilled marketing teams and near limitless budgets). 

This whole process can be done on a spreadsheet and a lot of companies end up there, with mountains of spreadsheets everywhere (which doesn't scale very well and can be terrifying from a security standpoint

> Here's an upfront/honest answer with no intentions of being rude, just trying to help.

First, get a job at an agency to gain real-world experience and learn more about marketing. There's no course out there that will enable you to run an agency. 

Starting a marketing agency without having prior experience in digital marketing is like trying to become a football coach without knowing how to play football. It just doesn't work.

* **Get an internship locally, wouldn't be paid but might get me the confidence.** Obviously sucks to not get paid, but as a last resort, it can help you get started.
* **Try getting a job, absolutely terrible pay but might get me real experience.** This would be a good option, at least for a year so you can gain some real experience. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.
* **Do another Google Project Management Specialization (Coursera), along with my Digital Marketing one it might help me land a better role at some company.** Courses always help, so you should do as many as you  can to learn as much as you can. But in most cases, they will only be differentiators for entry-level positions. Don't expect to get a better pay because you have courses, most other job applicants will have them too.
* **Learn how to run PPC Ads myself and work as a contractor for some other agency owner.** It's extremely unlikely any agency will hire you as a contractor with no prior experience. Their goal is to spend fewer hours managing their clients by delegating to contractors, not spend more time teaching you the job.
* **I don't need to learn the technical aspects of running ads myself, as I will be delegating it to a contractor anyways, and just suck it up and try finding clients (after obv figuring out my niche, service delivery, and creating an offer).** You won't be able to hire a good contractor if you have no experience yourself. I've seen this happen over and over, and it literally never works.
* **Get a remote video editing job with a decent pay, and think about building an agency around that business (will have to sell my phone & camera to get myself a decent editing rig).** If you have proven experience in video editing, this would be the best choice. Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.

> First of all - good for you have decided you want to get involved into business / making your own money.  Being freelance myself for 6+ years, 2 of them running my own agency I can give you these tips from the bottom of my heart:

1 - don't chase status, which you are by asking a the question "what" agency you should start. I'm not accusing you, but it comes off as you wanting to get "the answer" of what service to start. Now image your car breaks down and you call a mechanic. But this mechanic is doing this only for two weeks and don't get your car running, just because someone told him being a mechanic is "the best way to be self-employed". 

Now, the point I'm trying to make here is that running an agency sounds cool, but is it? Rather than focusing on the status, focus on yourself and your skills. Nowadays you can make money with everything, literally. What skills do you have or have the interest to learn? What "problem" do you want to solve or what kinda people do you want to have an impact on? Don't wanna work with people? Maybe a service based model isn't for you, maybe it is, only you could know. 

Go step by step, it's like a game. Don't ask what Porsche you should buy if you haven't earned your first $1 yet. Don't ask about the agency, ask about your skills, your interests and what you could do all day without even getting paid. 

2 - plan maximum only 12 weeks, not 10 years. You have no clue what's waiting for you on the other side. It always never plays out the way your think / plan and that's okay, it's called live. Ride the wave, enjoy every minute of it and focus on your craft. 

3 - talk to a lot of people. Be interested in different business models, entrepreneurs, "agency owners" (not Iman Ghadzi videos) and ask about their service, experiences and upcoming. The phase you're in is the very very first step, act like it. You don't need to make 100k, you don't need automations or fancy systems / software / coaching. Stay away from shiny objects and try being okay with you having no clue what you're doing. Don't put a time on it, it's about the lifestyle with all the goods (status, money, accomplishments) and the bad (confusion, clueless, loneliness, disappointment etc.) 

You're gonna find your thing, wish you all the best :-)

> Longtime manager of a corporate law firm here. Corporate firms are generally pretty traditional places as far as dress code and expected behavior, and a very different atmosphere than what you've seen on TV. If you have questions about what to wear, I'd ask whomever hired you (HR manager or office manager, I'm guessing) for guidance. Observe how others are dressed and don't try to stand out. Err on the conservative side until you've been there a while and get an idea of what they consider acceptable.

If you're going to be the receptionist, your first obligation is to be dependable. Be unfailingly on time. Be pleasant and polite, but not too chatty. Once you get the lay of the land and are comfortable with your primary responsibilities, make yourself useful to others. If you see other staff members in the weeds, offer to help them. Assistants and paralegals often need help making copies, scanning documents, preparing mail, making file folders and binders, etc. Let them know they can rely on you and earn their trust.

Be a team player and be proactive. No job is too small, especially when you're starting out.

Don't be afraid to ask questions when you're learning the ropes, but take notes and be careful to not ask the same question repeatedly. Law firms are busy places and people are usually generous with helping out new folks, but that will wear thin quickly if you don't retain what you've been told.

Very importantly, be sure to take a beat and proofread your emails before sending in order to keep typos and grammar mistakes to a minimum, and make sure to communicate clearly.

Law firms are fantastic places to grow. Good luck to you! I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park.

> A couple of months ago I celebrated 25 years since going solo. Best decision I ever made. A few tips: 

First, get a "virtual office" lease in an executive suite. IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. 

Second, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. 

Third, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. 

Finally, be flexible. I was doing 80 percent commercial litigation when the recession of '08 hit. I ate receivables in the high six figures when clients started feeling the pressure (see Tip #3) and pivoted to personal injury. Turns out I like it better.

You don't need Calendly (Clio Grow has most of that functionality). You don't need ClickUp (Clio Manage has a better task management).

  
Consider getting a virtual receptionist service within 3 months, but you don't need it immediately.

They don't need their data collected, they need to have a consultation booked the minute they call.

> Former web developer, now law professor. After extensive testing I am comfortable saying ChatGPT can't even accurately answer questions about the legal documents it has drafted itself, even within the same context window. 

Leaving that aside, I think you are really misunderstanding how lead generation and client interaction work for lawyers, particularly in the world of contracts. We run a lot of risk whenever giving legal advice, and even more if we endorse legal representations we haven't even reviewed. 

By the time something like this is tuned for ethical compliance it's less of a lead generation tool than an answering service, but now with pages of disclaimers preceding it.

Generative AI is revolutionizing legal practice, but it's absolutely not ready to be client-facing yet, let alone facing prospective clients.

> Without working the typical 9-5…. We work mostly all hours or all days. The lies you see on YouTube are not how real people actually run agencies. 

AI = this isn’t going to be a viable service for a long time.  If it was easy to fine tune and get working flawlessly all agencies would be doing it. We are using AI for some highly rudimentary tasks in an app we are building that has been profoundly useful but complex AI usage is still a long ways out (depending on the task).

Finding Customers = this is literally the hardest part for every business type. It is the business part. You don’t have a business unless you have exchanged money for something that is not money. It is the single failure point of most businesses at most ages new and old. This is actually hard and it should be. I would argue that it can be the easiest part of an agency after your first 10-15 clients… but you have to get them and REALLY make them feel like they under pay you with results. 

SAAS = i think your questions around this make it hard to answer in a useful way. No good SAAS is going to be fast to build. The easiest way to test a business is this. Tell me who your target customer is in less than 10 seconds…. Tell me what major problem of theirs you are solving in less than 10 seconds…. If you repeat that to a potential customer can you show them in sub 90 seconds something really high value… if these are easy you likely have an actually good product if you start solving large scale financial problems. 

I own an agency with 15 employees, 10 years in business, 2 SAAS products created as a result. We created a Wordpress hosting company (because we have a LOT of people we do hosting for). This solves a problem for us… we are a large customer and it saves us money. It also allows us to direct people who are not ready for our services to a good place to host their site and reach out with questions. The second SAAS is an alternative to Mailchimp, Klayvio, etc… this took 2.5 years and was a $1m yrr business the day we launched it. 

The above is how most agencies progress over the years you find customer, fix problems, niche down to charge people in areas you are most beneficial with your experience and then make software to sell to the general public and stand it up on your agency. I have 6 friends who had 8 figure exits from agencies and this same story would explain 100% of them. Hopefully something in here is of use to someone :) cheers 🍻

> No good answer, the expectations are just legitimately wonky. People in other industries don't understand, but you can't think about your day as adding up to 100% - it's 120%, or more. 100% client service PLUS additional time spend on everything else.

Agree with people saying its a test. Agree with people saying that if you can't or don't want to manage it, you should leave. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING!! I personally have about 1-2 years left of this in me. I just don't care about this job...climbing higher than I have...selling so that this company profits. I care about other things too and that's OK and probably healthy :)

Word of advice: take your PTO; take some bench time and really disconnect / use it to catch up on things. You don't need 110% utilization. The valleys enable the peaks. Until they don't anymore :)

> > Your messages are going in all directions and I don't know what your paragraphs about MBB have to do with BC Partners, but your post history is colorful so I'll bite.

BC partners was no more than a gentle nudge to your post where you wrote BC Partners instead of "BC Strategy" the name of the boutique in the original post. Nothing more. Obviously it wasn't a huge mistake on your part, hence me not making a big deal about it, but now that you try to put it on me....

MBB is literally because that's the entire topic of the thread....

> You work for a PE roll-up/have spent your entire career in the PE space don't you? It's a totally different job doing strategy at a large company vs doing strategy at your place.

No. Buy-and-build and PE were both a small part of my career. Currently I am at a public company, low billions revenue so not huge. None of the roles that involved strategy were in a buy-and-build.

>Broadly speaking
>your strategy is already decided the day the PE fund invests (wild oversimplification, but true in the grand scheme of things)
>.....
>A lot of the fund's focus is on transactions and transformation, not "strategy". There's not a ton of strategising that can be done effectively if you need to exit within 5 years

Agreed on all of the above, which is why corpdev roles in buy-and-builds never involve, nor claim to involve, strategy. 

> So of course you don't need an MBB and of course you don't see the value of MBBs. But your POV doesn't represent the entire market.

Not sure where you got the impression from that I "don't see the value of MBBs". As I said multiple times, I see the value there; they service the needs of the c-suite well and when I was in PE they served me well too. What I said was that other second tier management don't see that positive side of them, they only see the negatives. Hence the reasoning behind my entire argument; that FOR THOSE PEOPLE (note again not for everybody) the "ex-MBB" claim isn't as positive as it is to other consultants, or as it may be to the C-Suite. That has nothing to do with my opinion, nor with the actual experience itself. Purely the experience that those at the corporates often have who aren't the direct client. 

> No. What makes MBBs unpleasant is not the people or the culture. It's the fact that some projects are critical and the C-suite is watching. An ex-MBB boutique would likely not get CEO-level work, or at least not the kind that involves a broad engagement with the organisation, not least because they wouldn't have enough people.

Sure, but other projects are also critical and that is exactly what is raised by the SBU and division heads. The projects that they have can't get put on hold due to another project that is running. They also have the c-suite, ie their direct report, watching them throughout and they have to answer to the c-suite for any delays. The people and the culture absolutely aren't bad, agreed, otherwise the same firms wouldn't be filled with ex-consu

> 1/2

First things first you have to ask yourself - why would someone buy a website from you? When they ask what you do that’s better, what are you gonna say? When they ask about SEO and ranking better and what you do for that, what are you gonna say? What problems are you solving for them? What is wrong with their current site, why is it wrong, how do you fix it, and why are you uniquely able to fix it? Sales is the first Hurdle for most developers. It’s not easy. It’s a whole other way of thinking and now you have to talk to people, be personable, knowledgeable, and navigate the conversation skillfully to close the sale. It’s not about the website or their old one looking bad. It’s about what problems you solve. People buy solutions. And if you don’t have any, you won’t sell very much. So you need to work on that. What is your unique selling point, what do you do better than anyone else, and what problems you are solving for them and why it’s a problem. And if all you’re doing is slinging cheap crappy Wordpress themes then you are no better than Raj in Pakistan charging $200 on fiver. You can’t compete and you won’t solve any problems, which means you won’t get referrals or repeat business because your websites just sit there like their old ones did. It looks better. But they have no traffic and no conversions. Why? If you can’t answer that question then you aren’t ready to start.

Also Focus on how to use flexbox and grid, transforms, transitions, mobile first coding, positioning, differences between display block and Inline block, etc. very important to have the basics mastered.

I HIGHLY recommend finding a good designer to work with. You can find good ones for $20 an hour in Asia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. They’re amazing out there. My guy in Bangladesh is the core of my design team. I gave him a raise to $25 an hour. And once we keep growing I’m bumping that up too and taking care of them nicely. Design is hard. I try to do it myself sometimes, but it’s always just easier having someone better at it than you so you can focus on the things you do better and are more productive at. You’ll be glad you did.

Then there’s pricing!

I have two packages:

I have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance

or $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc.

$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself.

Lump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.

Nice, simple pricing. Simple projects. No databases. No booking features. No payment processing. Wanna know why? Because you don’t have to build everything yourself. There’s so many third party services out there that do niche specific booking services and perfected it for you. Just have your client set up a few demos with some companies and find the one that works best for them, their company rep will help

> I run a similar business except we focus seller leads for real estate investments. Its essential for us to keep track of conversions in order to improve our marketing effort. At the end of the day we don't sell leads we sell results and making sure that we have a cohesive relationship between marketing and sales is a big part of what we do. At the end of the day  our clients prefer that we keep them on track to improve their performance and our performance. Any leads that are not ready to convert we plug them into the appropriate lead nurturing work flow until they are ready to convert. We essentially have to keep close tabs on our clients leads and make sure they are not missing appointment or that they ar not following up. Everyone takes accountability. We also have our analytics integrated for offline conversions. We also keep track of phone recordings to see what's goin on. Your client has no benefit in lying to you or misleading you. I recommend you have them pay upfront for your services. I hope that answers your question. Were very neurotic with the way we operate, and that's what the profession needs. You need to be the best because any small improvements in your system result in multiple hundred of thousands of dollars if not millions. Anyways hope that helps. Good Luck!

> I use a process I call Demo & Close with current clients and prospects:

Here's how it works:

1. I send them a DM or an email with something like this: 

*Hey \[First Name\],*

*Most business owners don’t know this, but chatbots are saving companies $300K+/year in support and sales costs.*

*I went ahead and built a starter chatbot for \[Business Name\], just using public info from your site - it’s already answering FAQs and capturing leads.*

*Want me to show you how it works (and what it could be saving you)?*

*Quick 10-min call - promise it’ll be worth your time.*

  
2. When they actually book a call, I enter their website URL into [noem.ai](http://noem.ai) and customize a very basic support Ai agent for them

3. on the call, I use Noem's chrome extension to show them what it'll look like on their own website, how it solves their customer's problems, how it upsells their Shopify products... and answer any questions they have

4. it usually ends with - can you finish building this for me?

5. Based on what they want I decide whether to do it myself and keep 100% profit (usually around $3000+hosting fees) or pay noem $250, have them build it and keep the difference. 

  
Your old clients probably don't need more of your services, but everyone is now transitioning to Ai and are too busy or overwhelmed. You can be the solution.
