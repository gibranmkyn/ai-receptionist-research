> Great breakdown! Your data on the plumbing business saving $4,300/month really resonates with what we've seen in the field.

I've found a few additional patterns worth sharing:

1. Warm transfers are critical - the biggest complaint from users isn't that they're talking to AI, but that they have to repeat themselves when transferred to a human. We built a transcript handoff that solved this.

2. Voice quality matters less than latency. People forgive robotic voices but hate waiting 2-3 seconds for responses. We got ours down to <20ms and saw satisfaction jump 40%.

3. Double-booking is a silent killer in appointment flows. Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).

4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list. We implemented an AI receptionist for a home care provider that automated their 20-minute intake process, saving $200-300k annually. The elderly clients actually preferred it because it never rushed them.

Have you looked at legal intake at all? We're seeing law firms with massive ROI on qualification.

> Looking for the best AI receptionist. Tried Sonant so far, curious what others are using

I’ve been exploring AI receptionists to help handle incoming calls and reduce missed opportunities for my small insurance office. Most of my callers hang up without leaving a voicemail, and it’s been a recurring issue during busy hours. 

I recently started using Sonant AI and it’s been a game changer. It answers instantly 24/7, and handles basic stuff like intake questions and appointment requests without missing a beat. And it sounds real and most people have no idea that it’s AI. It also integrates easily with the systems I already use which is just great.

That said, there are a ton of options out there like Smith AI, Dialzara, etc. but their pricing and features are all over the place. Has anyone done a deep dive or tested multiple tools? Curious what’s actually worked well for others in practice.
