> Here’s what I did:
1) get the business knowledge by reading these books emyth or emyth attorney, dot com secrets, and the personal mba

2) choose your top service and systematize it from phone call to termination letter. Your goal is to create a rough initial standard operating procedure. It will be improved on over time but you need to start doing this asap

3) then do the same for the next top few service offerings

4) invest in systems that make you more efficient. I use (a) back office berries to answer & calls, schedule initial phone consultations and paid consults

5) have a very selective filtering mechanism early. I only do free 15 minute phone consultations.  ANYTHING in person is mandatory paid consult. I offer a deal of $350 for up to 90 mins but you choose. ANYTHING that requires me to review documents is a paid consultation. I get about 2-5 of these a month. 

5)  in your consult determine the top questions you need to determine whether this is a potential ideal client. If not, end the consult as soon as you can (respectfully of course). If so, make your offer in that initial consult. Don’t negotiate. Don’t talk any more about it. Simply, “it be my honor to help you with this, I charge a $10k retainer and bill $450/hour. If you’d like to move forward today I can email you my service agreement, Intake form, and invoice”

6) you need to have the minimum tech to make this as painless as possible for clients and you. I use Clio grow and Clio manage to schedule appointments, email retainer, email intake form, take payments, etc. you can use whatever you want but I guarantee you adding just these lead intake/sales SOPs and tech will make you like 20% more efficient almost immediately and increase revenue and efficiently over time 

7) you should be very anal about your cases. Say no to the cases that are not going to be profitable. If you want to help people or do pro bono keep that separate from your business. A business is only a business if it is profitable. Or else it’s a prison. 

8) focus on your business before paying any marketing, hiring people, etc.. you need to build the systems first, then invest in growth if you want. Having these systems will solve so many of the problems you mentions. 

Finally, remember the old bull/young bull story. Focus only on the case at a time. Slow if smooth and smooth is fast. So don’t be afraid to not answer phones. (Even better get an answering service).

> What kind of cases are you looking for.  Avoid the high dollar high competition stuff.  Sure there is good potential returns there - but you can bleed yourself dry fighting the bot spam that just eats up your dollars on pay to play stuff.  Find a good source of fee for service work - severance package review? record sealing? contract review? hoa disputes? general counsel stuff that pays the bills monthly and gives you a baseline.  Plenty of these are low dollar low competition.  Avoid "best PERSONAL INURY LAWYER" that can cost 500 dollars a click and with a few bad actors kill your budgets and give you no conversions.  You need to generate more reviews than your near peer competitor by like 2:1.  You don't even need to do work to get a good review.  Find them a good referral, send them to the self help center, be nice to take 2 minutes on the phone and help them out without providing too much and boom 5 stars.  There is just so many little low hanging fruit type things that you can do that get your name out there.  Tip staff well and leave a card.  Tell everyone that you are a lawyer.  Give your staff bonuses to refer cases and have them all tell everyone they are a lawyer.   I have been growing a firm for a year and a half - our organic traffic used to be under 200 a month on google, it's over 12,000 now and been growing like a weed.  We have a full time in house call center to handle the call volume.  We try to find a home for every call.  Something comes in that we don't do - were referring it to someone we know that does that and saving them some time searching the internet more.  Those referrals come back full circle.  Happy to answer any questions and point you in the right direction.  DO NOT JUST BLINDLY TRUST MARKETING COMPANIES.  You need to know your way around the ad accounts and make sure they arent wasting money on leads that you arent interested in.  Google has gotten bad and exact match keywords have become more broad and the broad stuff has just become an asterisk for whatever google wants.  You will see that you have to manage negative keyword lists daily or you are burning dollars.  Ad companies and google arent going to come give your refunds.  Keep your finger on the pulse of what every dollar is doing and how you are measuring those results through call data or lead data or chats or forms or email.  Whatever it is - those leads that don't convert are lost opportunity, unless you follow-up with them with ongoing email campaigns, friendly reminders, helpful blogs, etc.

> This is a terrible idea. Don’t even consider it. Run. 


Source: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer 

Okay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn’t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:


The only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. 

You will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. 


*Why hours on just this?*


Because a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you’ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you’ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). 

This will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. 


*How do you bill 2100?!?!*


Oh boy… you will hear the phrase “capture your time” and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don’t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you’ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn’t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn’t billable and will add up as you’re learning). 


If the mind numbing work and hours don’t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS

You can’t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It’s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. 


ID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate

> NAD, this isn’t the answer you’re looking for but offering a pov from someone with dental defects. I’d suggest looking into medical billing and coding for oral healthcare. 

There’s such a lack of knowledge in this area at practices and most dentists are afraid to tackle medical insurance/suggest the patient to do it. 

There are lots of CPT that are mirror to CDT codes beyond implants or bone grafting etc. Even restorations are truly considered prosthetics. 

Dental care is not an essential benefit, but congenital defects are and habilitation services for functional impairment. Someone with a peg lateral has a birth defect so a crown is considered prosthetic intervention and can be argued to medical insurance that the primary purpose is to correct congenital defects. 

At this point you wouldn’t even need to have a contract with the insurance yet because you can have patients petition you in network under network gap exception. There’s no other dentist, perio, or pros doing this so the network doesn’t have a provider. You then can work with a rep or have the patient ask about the max allowable amounts to figure out your rates. 

Beyond that, there’s also just preventative services, X-rays, cbct scans, services related to dental caries that all have icd-10 codes and cpt codes. 

The reason why I’m suggesting this as a business opportunity. Because being the only practice that does this could be a big deal.

On top of that, the ELSA Act is hopefully going to pass Congress this year. So a lot of dental practices won’t even know about this legislation let alone the insurance they could be using to help patients from it 

Final and last point, dental insurance has gotten ridiculous at this point. Between them covering nothing, the push for corporate dental chains, the ridiculously low out of pocket maximums, and the low contracted amounts it’s an archaic institution where medical insurance could be the future of oral care.

### r/VOIP — 2023-07-15 | 2pts

> >Does this mean we're never, ever able to recommend businesses or alternatives when posters ask questions? 

You are 100% allowed to recommend businesses when replying to requests in the monthly requests thread.

Otherwise if someone asks "How do I do X with provider Y?" and you respond with "You should use provider Z instead", you are breaking the rules.

If someone is looking for help solving a specific problem, it is never acceptable to recommend alternatives. It **is** however perfectly fine to say "this is a problem inherent to Service XYZ. The only solution is to change providers." This answers the question without promoting any particular competitor.

&#x200B;

>the way you are thinking of doing this is way overkill, I would recommend going with \[insert name of commonly used Voip service\] for this 

Is the "overkill" solution *the only way to do it* within the OP's ecosystem? If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say "Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider. If you want a different solution you will have to find a new business to work with."

&#x200B;

> So we're never allowed to mention names of Voip services, SIP apps, number parking services, etc. etc. outside of the quarantined threads? Is that what I'm reading? 

No. Discussions of business, services and products is not only allowed, but encouraged. The only stipulation is that it must be *on topic* and not promotional.

For example:

Someone asks "Which of these three PBXs can be integrated with Provider XYZ?"

Here is a good reply:

"XYZ Telecom, VoIP Provider W, and ABC123 all work. I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\_to\_website or you will have a bad time."

Here is a bad reply:

"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support"

One of them answers the question ("Which can be integrated?") while also giving helpful insight ("some settings misbehave"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.

If on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying "I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment" is fine, because the API requiring PHP

> Lots of good perspective has already been added on how you should SELL your work moving forward.
But to answer your question, you should have already agreed upon a model with this client if you term used is ‘billing’ instead of ‘quoting’.
When it’s an hourly rate, I charge my clients the same if it’s prepping for a workshop, leading the workshop, doing technical work or reading through a thread of 10 emails I was forwarded for context.
Other projects it’s for an agree total cost for x services. The ‘risk’ is mine if it takes me longer due to complexity, but so is the upside if I’m really efficient.

> If you can, start telling people now. Start networking, getting lunches, etc. I've found that it creates almost immediate returns. Get a biz card to hand out.

Focus on one or two specific areas of law. When I started, I was doing way too many different areas of law. I do solely criminal defense/personal injury now and I wish I went in that way. I have a few crapper cases that I wish I never took on because I really just hate them. They cause unneeded stress.

Keep overhead low as possible. You really don't need an answering service. With google workspace + open phone + Squarespace I have a functional website, phone number, etc for what averages to about $40 a month all together.

Reduce ads and avoid unneeded lawyer campaign services (FL, Superlawyers, Avvo, etc.). I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth. The criminal leads were usually flops and just fishing for free advice. The people calling didn't understand that I paid $80+ just to have them click on an ad.

Accept your fate. Once you go solo its basically you grasping at destiny. I left a very good, very easy government job to take it on. Part of me wishes to crawl back into that hole and just sit there until I retire. Part of me looks back and regrets leaving but most of me is happy and proud of myself that I took a risk to better my situation. I knew I could be better and wanted a bit more of a challenge. Another thing is to accept the lack of a "steady" income and benefits. Some months will be much better than others.

Good luck and honestly be really sure before you set off. It's a rough road. It's not easy. You'll make TONS of solo friends/lawyers who are in your same situation and have similar experiences. Everything will be alright. Mentally prepare yourself for the journey ahead.

> I agree with the other comment about targeting startups. Especially if they have capital (VC-backed or self-funded). The angle for idea-stage can be a quick, confidential and well-polished MVP, which can go a long way if they're planning to fundraise/pitch. Sure the barrier to making MVPs is lower with nocode tools etc, but this drives higher scrutiny, competition and standards, which is where your expertise shines.

If it's more of a bootstrapped startup, you can probably negotiate a small equity share in lieu of higher upfront compensation. Obviously this is riskier but if you believe in the product, team and vision, the reward can be greater.

Aside from startups, consider the many successful businesses with established cashflow and traction in their market. Advances in AI and computing present an opportunity for many of them to modernize their workflows. Changing market conditions are pressuring many to adapt (increase their capacity to serve excess demand) or answer surging expenses (increase efficiency by cutting costs to remain profitable). In either case this will push many to vertically integrate (where you come in to build their outsourced tools in-house, or to leverage their data and SOPs with AI and automation). 

In many cases this looks like you assessing their tech stack and logically designing in-house product to replace these services and save them in the long run on subscriptions and retainers. Or if you go the AI/automation route, consulting to identify those assets and repetitive tasks to spin into systems saving them work hours (and potentially increasing conversion rates or unlocking new offers for a compounding effect).

This agency model (+ AI) is quite attractive to me and I'd love to connect and explore collaborating if anyone is open to expanding their current team or forming a new one.

> I would say do take the opportunity to learn from the system and rise in the company if you can.  


My simple suggestion would be to help the owners understand that what they're doing is smart for reasons people mention below (tracking and training and quality assurance) but your concerns are valid the risk of the lack of empathy can lead to bad reviews and complaints -- which is something you sound like you care about.  


I have been in both positions (a business manager, and someone who worked phones in entry level positions and reception roles) so usually the "script" will evolve for hundreds of unanticipated scenarios as well as unhinged people, and it will take someone with experience and empathy to drive the impmementation (even if through AI). 


Alternatively, if you're looking for a new opportunity don't put your previous owner on blast in the legal community -- simply focus on your strengths as many people are looking to hire intake coordinators.  


That being said if youre able to assimilate AI intake (and high quality tracking) into your skillset, you'll be more valuable to many law firm business managers.

> I automate tasks using code, notmake nor zapier (niche and type-agnostic). It gives me much more freedom for how I design a solution (especially if I'll work with 3rd party websites that don't have zapier integrations) and it's cheaper tbh. So I can automate any task as long as I understand it. Just as I did for my client, I first understood the tasks he wanted to automate (he literally did them in front of me in a cafe). He thought it was impossible to automate such tasks (they were very hard complex for a robot) but he wanted to try with me. On my way home, I started thinking of the frameworks and tools I'd use. I had the MVP running one month later and set up the whole pipeline (from his wooco api until the email is sent to his customers) start of september. I will deploy next week on aws (More details below for how his business is expected to go from 20k MRR to 100k MRR in about 6 months)

Also, I just automated a important task in my father's job. He usually spends 4 hrs every week repeating the same task 200 times !!! I almost got angry hearing that. It's torture. It's like the punishments we used to have in elementary school when we write a sentence 100 times. No human should do such tasks. His task was very simple, I finished the main script in 2 hours. I literally just showed him the demo and he'll talk to his boss tomorrow about it.

&#x200B;

More details on his case: Automation of admin tasks. The software was custom for his use case (he is a solo-preneur and he needed a LOT of time for order-fulfillment and customer support. He couldn't scale the business and was leaving a lot of money on the table. Having a virtual assistant presented security risks). I integrated my solution with his woocommerce account (used the wooco api), google sheets, an email service provider and another 3rd party website. He laughed so hard when I run the demo in front of him. He wants to scale for BFCM period. We are now talking about how we can make a chatbot (not like the ones that say non-sense, but an actual chatbot that understands and assists customers. Customer support is very important for his business and it can increase sales in a crazy way, literally just by answering 2-3 questions for a customer!!) I am now preparing the data to finetune gpt-4.

> Start by reaching out directly to small law firms in your area - cold calling and dropping off resumes in person can actually work really well in the legal field, especially for entry-level positions like file clerk, receptionist, or legal assistant. Many small firms don't bother posting jobs online because they prefer word-of-mouth or direct approaches. Your criminal justice background is definitely relevant, so highlight that in your resume and cover letter. While you're at it, check if your school has any internship programs with local firms, reach out to your criminal justice professors for contacts (they often know local attorneys), and consider joining your local bar association as a student member - they usually have job boards and networking events where you can meet attorneys looking for help. The legal world is still pretty old-school when it comes to networking and hiring, so don't be afraid to put yourself out there in person.

> I'd be surprised if this existed on any system out of the box. It would be possible to build, but it wouldn't be trivial.

Many VOIP systems allow calls to certain areas and only require a PIN for calls to other areas. For instance, local calls would be free, and international calls would require a PIN. 

Otherwise, if calls are especially rare, you could have the Supervisor initiate a call to the receptionist, call the external number, join the calls, and drop.

I know Asterisk has a way to trigger scripts on outbound calls. You could write an app that triggers when a call is made, pushes a notification to a cell phone, and completes.the call if it's authorized. You could hire someone to build something like this for you

> Yeah, I think overall it is a good platform, and if you're providing it to businesses it's nice especially since it is super customizable and open to so many different scenarios and use cases. Long as you understand the risks and put in place things to minimize them with the lack of cluster and node support. I was toying around with the idea of running proxmox or xen clusters to host the PBX VMs and then do some dns proxy to load balance the call requests. But I'd also have to figure out how to keep the working directories synced across them all.. or just have the clusters in a HA failover scenario to give additional failover systems instead of just one. At some point, it just became more beneficial to look at other systems that are already setup for redundancy and hosted to keep this headache and overhead cost off my plate.

And I just started providing phone services last year. I only have a little over 100 extensions set with a couple of tenants. With about 50 or so set up in the pipeline soon to be onboarded. So really I'm probably not the best judge. There are other users with a much larger customer base that would have better insight into it than me. There's a user here on Reddit named TheRealNalaLockspur that owns a company called Sipharmony that uses Vodia for its cloud system. I would bet he's the biggest player using the platform you would find around here if you want to reach out. He would be your best insight into the ins and outs of the platform. They have done a lot of in-house dev stuff to really make the platform their own from what I have seen.

I liked Netsapiens enough when I was looking at it. But when it's literally one of the major platforms out there.. It's just hard to justify a company going with you over a larger outfit that provides the exact same phone service. At probably a lower price because they can offset the costs and margins with volume. I think it's better than most other larger providers, but at the same time what differentiates you and them? Apart from support, and pricing, you're literally the exact same feature set and user experience as competing MSPs or VoIP companies in your area. Just my 2c and how I view it all. Definitely not knocking Netsapiens or anyone using it or providing it like OIT, Viirtue, RingLogix, etc. I think it's a solid platform overall.

As for alternatives I've been looking at a company called Voxo. They fully host everything, are redundant, they have one seat price for partners that include literally everything. Nothing is extra apart from toll-free and international minutes. They also collect, remit, and pay all FCC, USAC, USF, telecom tax bs on your behalf. So you literally only pay a flat fee per extension and that's it. It's a much smaller company than anyone using netsapians, or any of the other big cloud providers. Nextiva, Zoom, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral, etc. But honestly, that's what I like about them. Support is super fantastic. I literally get a response within minutes and

> Really nice answer. I admire your help.

The Ukrainian market is quite different from that of other countries. There are not many big players who use consulting services, so there are no companies like EY Parthenon here. I work at S&O KPMG. Besides, of the big three, there is only McKinsey with about 30 consultants. So there is not a lot of choice in the context of the big three.

About me. Previously taught English, but decided to look for a job in my specialty. Now I've finished 3 undergraduate courses and am going into my 4th. I'm studying at the best university in the country. There is no opportunity for men to leave the country, so no internships either.

I like different case championships, I won a couple of small ones, also I reached the finals of the Deloitte tax championship. This year I want to try CFA with my team.

University activities are an added plus. In my department, we were involved in inviting speakers for the university, and they talked about their startups, their work in various companies, and so on.

I'm thinking about switching to another company because I'm afraid of getting stuck in one place and then it will be difficult to change it. I like my job and my team. So now I see two options in front of me:

1.	⁠Continue to do what I do, but in a more serious firm.
2.	⁠Go into investment banking. I am interested in it, first of all, because I see people who I think are smart going there. Thanks to you, I now have more options!

I hope I was able to maximize my profile. Your response is really important to me. Thank you for it

> Really nice answer. I admire your help.

The Ukrainian market is quite different from that of other countries. There are not many big players who use consulting services, so there are no companies like EY Parthenon here. I work at S&O KPMG. Besides, of the big three, there is only McKinsey with about 30 consultants. So there is not a lot of choice in the context of the big three.

About me. Previously taught English, but decided to look for a job in my specialty. Now I've finished 3 undergraduate courses and am going into my 4th. 
I'm studying at the best university in the country. There is no opportunity for men to leave the country, so no internships either.

> Wow, that sounds comprehensive! 

\> We have an AI proposal builder built off our knowledge base. It’s early days;

Is it built internally using an open source or a cloud LLM, or is it a third-party company providing it as a service or building it for you?

\> I’ve used these Gen AI solutions to research and list case studies … I recon each time they come up with 50% or more fabricated cases … or at least cases I can’t find any evidence off;

Just the regular chatgpt/copilot/gemini/claude, or the proposal builder trained on your knowledge base? I never thought of using GenAI for case studies, just searching for keywords and hashtags on our knowledge base or google. Now that I write this, it sounds so old school lol, google itself will sometimes give me a generated response...

\> the results still smell like AI

I once had a discussion with chatgpt where it used a regular tone answering my question, but immediately switching to ridiculously optimistic for a section it suggested putting into the document. I'm like - hey, come on, I just saw you can use a normal tone!

I tried something like this for style and tone and it helped to some degree - https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1930ljx/how\_to\_make\_chat\_gpt\_mimic\_your\_writing\_style/. Have you tried?

\> I wouldn’t risk my career on an interns work

I'm totally with you. But I'm thinking - how far we can teach the LLM to do the right thing? Same as you need to teach a new hire if you want them to really perform.

Imagine a day in 10 years - an AI-generated demand creates an AI-generated RFP responded by an AI-generated proposals from different vendors and evaluated by AI selecting a winner, and then a winner proposal and the original RFP used to generate a cloud deployment that just works. GenAI will call it ZHIT - Zero Human Interaction Transaction.

> I went to law school so I could sue big companies and hold wrongdoers responsible for the injuries they cause. 

I love representing Plaintiffs who are really hurt. Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. 

If...

If only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. 

I had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. 

One quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. 

There are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  

In the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.

But oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. 

Then there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. 

When they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. 

Oddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. 

Your client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every

> At the most basic level, the answer is simple: other firms are already implementing AI, and clients will notice if you’re not.

But the heart of your post seems to be: Why would I use AI when I can have a paralegal bill for the same work and make more money?

The short answer: because when your competitors stop charging two hours for something AI does in minutes, you’ll either start losing clients — or, worse, face serious complaints about your billing practices. And it’s not just a business risk — it’s also a reputational and ethical one. As AI becomes more capable, continuing to bill for tasks that could be automated starts to look like you’re padding hours.

This change is inevitable. Even if your clients aren’t pushing now, they will. There’s a short window where AI is still optional. Soon, it’ll be expected and you’ll be scrambling to catch up when clients start asking why your competition delivers the same result in half the time for less money.

As for upcharging: clients pay for value, not process. If AI lets you deliver better outcomes, faster, with fewer errors — you might justify premium pricing. But you’re not going to get away with charging for what’s clearly been automated busywork for too long.

> I am experiencing something very similar. I have been fruitlessly searching for a decent paying position in Office Administration, so when I was invited via text message to interview with Adam Marshall at K&L Gates I was super pumped. It did seem too good to be true, for instance they asked me what I would require for payment and I said around $23 an hour, with $19 being my lowest that I could accept. He responded that the job pays $30.19 an hour and it is remote! I was thrilled, but still wary. He did a full interview, all on Teams, with 13 questions including 3 references and their contact info, so I may have just screwed 2 people I used to work with along with my best friend by giving the scam artist their phone numbers!! Next he said I needed to wait for a check he was sending by snail mail, then stopped and sent another text message stating that the accounting department just informed him that it would need to be sent to me through my email instead. Very quickly after getting "hired by his superiors", who supposedly reviewed my resume and my answers to the questions asked in the fake interview, I received the email with a check for $2,390.00 to be given to the serviceman who came to hook up my new equipment, including a very fast HP computer. I was over at my mother's house by this time, and we just kept looking at one another like, "What the Hell? Can this be for real? Who sends a two thousand dollar check to someone they have literally never even spoken to on the phone?" Next, I was instructed to capture a screenshot of the mobile deposit and send it for the accounting department's records. I did what he asked, except instead of a screenshot (another red flag, no banking app will allow you to take screenshots of your accounts in any way, shape, or form. DUH.), I used my son's camera to capture JUST the deposit info, none of my account info, thankfully. By this time I was beyond suspicious, and when I sent him the message with the fake deposit, he asked me to check and see if the funds were available yet. Hmmmmm, he works for a multi-million dollar company and he is worried about whether the funds are available? Although my bank did make some of the funds available right  away (only $500 of it, oddly enough), I lied and said they were still pending, at which point he instructed me to report to Teams (and him) at 8am tomorrow morning. All of this was happening after work hours, in fact I just finished the process at about midnight, which made it much more difficult because I cannot call K&L Gates and ask for the Human Resources department, or anyone else for that matter since all businesses are closed! Smart thinking on the scammer's part! The really sick part is he told me to "STAY BLESSED" after I said 'have a good night' to him. We have no money, I am a 50-year-old single mom of 5 trying to finish my degree, and it is impossible to get a job that pays decently AND that I am qualified for. I am 2 classes away from earning my associate's de

> There are a few schools of thought on finding out, or not finding out the budget. In a way, the price is the price regardless of how much they have to pay for it. On the other hand, if you want or need the work then you will likely be willing to fit your price into whatever constraints they put on you. Some people have strong arguments on one way of thinking about their budget or the other. Personally, if I can get the budget then I prefer to know the budget. 

So, if you haven't already, ask what them for the budget. There's nothing wrong with asking, and if you don't then you're flying blind. I sometimes use that analogy if someone wants a car, you need to know some details before you can point them in the right direction. New or used, low end or high end, features, etc. A car will get you there and back, but it could be a used Kia or a top in lambo. Apply that example to their project, a Shopify is not like all others, right? What will their budget allow in terms of bells, whistles, options, training, etc? If they have a small budget, you'll propose just the basics. If they have a large budget then you'll give them everything. 

Ask to speak to the client. If the design company won't allow it then it's a huge red flag. I long ago stopped working for intermediaries. It never worked out because you're answering to multiple parties, and in the end your client's client, who you don't have contact with, is the decision maker. That's a terrible situation to be in. And also, the intermediary can unilaterally cut you out whenever they want. You want contact, and a contract, with the end-client. If you can't get that and you still want to pursue the deal then you have risk that you should account for in your pricing. 

I like the idea of pricing in a set number of hours for support and training. Even better, be explicit about how many hours and what they get when you write your proposal and contract. Be sure to include in your proposal what your rate is for additional support and training, as well as for change orders. (they always want changes)

RE: bumping your cost to come up with the price. Are you adding any value to the project? Are you providing project management, scope management, communications, training, funding (you pay your dev before you get paid), etc? If so, include your time and liabilities in addition to the markup on your outsourced costs. Don't forget to pay yourself!

Before marking up the price, be sure to identify and quantify the risks of the project. The more risks you can account for, the better. So instead of arbitrarily slapping 40% on the developer's cost, first ensure that all your risks are accounted for in the price, then mark up on top of that for your profit. Shoot, 40% may be too low of a number. Where did you come up with that? Personally, I prefer to 2x to 3x my outsource direct costs because I have a shit ton of other expenses to account for besides just the COGS. 

Even better is to not price based on your cost. I

> A bit late but I think these are some valuable points. honestly getting that feedback is a blessing in disguise. it sucks to hear but "you're hard to follow" is way better than people just nodding along while having zero clue what you mean.

the biggest reason people struggle with this is that they **think out loud.** you are basically taking your listener on the "behind the scenes" tour of your brain instead of just giving them the final product.

here is the actual toolkit for fixing this without sounding like a robot.

**1\. The PREP Method (this is literally the cheat code)** if you struggle with structure just use this for every single answer in a meeting. it forces you to say the most important thing first so people dont lose the plot.

*   **Point:** state the bottom line first. (ex: "i think we should delay the launch")
    
*   **Reason:** the "why" in one sentence. ("because the api is still buggy")
    
*   **Example:** one quick stat or story. ("last time we launched with bugs we lost 10% of users")
    
*   **Point:** restate the bottom line. ("so we should wait until monday")
    

**2\. Stop being afraid of silence** most people ramble because they are terrified of those 2 seconds of silence after they finish a sentence. they fill it with "um" and "uh" or they just keep talking to fill the air.

**the fix:** when you finish a thought just stop. even if it feels awkward. it actually makes you look way more confident and gives the other person time to process what you just said. if you feel like you need to keep talking literally just bite your tongue.

**3\. The "Record and Cringe" exercise** this is the part everyone hates but it works the fastest. record yourself explaining something for 60 seconds then listen to it back (I like to use an app called Confidently for this, it's in any app store. You get 2 random words and then you have to improvise while it analyzes your face and voice and then it gives you instant feedback on things like articulation, facial confidence and vocal confidence etc.) you will realize you say the same thing 3 times in different ways.

*   improvise a 60 second explanation
    
*   listen to it and check the articulation score
    
*   do it again and again
    
*   Over time you'll notice you naturally start formulating and talking more concisely because of new neuronal pathways.
    

**4\. The ELI5 Rule (Explain Like I'm 5)** if you cant explain it simply you dont actually understand it as well as you think you do. before a meeting ask yourself how you would explain this to a smart 10 year old. if you need 5 minutes of jargon to get to the point you already lost the room.

**5\. Write it out first** if youre in a meeting and you know youre gonna have to speak soon write down your "Point" on a sticky note in 5 words or less. keep your eyes on that note while you talk. it acts like a tether so you dont wander off into a 10 minute story about nothing.

**tl;dr:** stop thinking out loud. give the answer fi

> The problem with this type of argument is the hang up on "thinking." I disagree that the robot can't think, but that's irrelevant. Intellect is about outcomes. 

If I need someone to verify the risk profile of a financial derivative using algorithmic methods, can you do it? OpenAI o1 can do it and is very good at it. Someone is getting hired to do this work, and my company doesn't care who it is as long as the output is solid. I'll pay a squirrel in nuts if it can do the calculation reliably. Humans and their brains don't have a monopoly on outcomes. 

The flaw of this argument is framing it as if humans "think" because they are able to reason their way to a good answer, and the others (robot, squirrel) don't think because they couldn't get to the answer. All these creatures can reason, the question is only if they have sufficient intelligence and knowledge to get to the answer using their own flavor of thinking techniques. The key concern is that human intellect is growing slowly, squirrel intellect is not growing in any meaningful way, but AI is growing its intellect exponentially with no sign of it stopping for the foreseeable future. 

OpenAI o1 today can already use its understanding of finance and math to assess risk by formulating a monte carlo algorithm in Python, then run and refine that algorithm until it yields a perfect result. And it can do that in 1 minute. If you think that's not "thinking," I'll respect your right to have an opinion, but when it comes to business outcomes, I simply don't concern myself with what you call what o1 just did. The outcome is what matters, and how efficiently and reliably it can do it. Inevitably, as AI gets more reliable, efficient and intelligent, it will be favored more and more across business outcomes.

> I can totally relate to what you're going through. I believe I’ve felt something similar to what you're described early on in my career.

I worked for a couple of big consulting shops before co-founding my own firm some years back. I’ve built and managed teams, and interviewed hundreds of people about the practice of consulting. Here’s some insights I’ve learned relating to your story. Take them with a pinch of salt, I’m just a random internet person.

1- Eat what’s on your plate; and dessert will follow. Stop distracting yourself by comparing yourself to your peers. Focus on the task at hand and do good work. The better you are at your job, the more levity you have to be you. If you're bored, ask for more challenging work. 
However, if you're half-arsing your current workload the senior team don't see an under utilised genius, the see a problem. Eat what's on your plate, and that will provide you with opportunities to progress.

2- If you're not getting useful feedback it's either because your manager doesn’t want to provide it (e.g., avoiding potential conflict, to busy, don't care) or they don't have the capability (they're poor at giving feedback). 
Regardless of the cause, the outcome is the same for you. In the absence of forthcoming or component managers, you need to find a way to make it easy for them. 

I find adapting Daniel Pink's "two irrational questions" quite helpful. E.g., "Dear manager, how might you rate my work on XYZ on a scale of 1-10?" If the manager gives less than 10 ask why it wasn't lower (proxy for positive feedback), and what would need to change to get it closer to 10 (proxy for improvement areas). Framing the conversion in this way serves to both force a perspective from your manager and give them a simple framework to give useful feedback to you. 

3- A great consultant knows that communication and bringing people along for the journey is CRITICAL to the job. Not so good at building relationships? Empathising with clients/colleagues to understand what's important to them? Or, adapting your behaviour to different settings?

Then either get better at it or change careers. These interpersonal skills are essential for a successful consulting career. If these are areas where you’re struggling, you can choose to actively improve or consider whether a different career path might suit you better. Most of this stuff are learned skills, it's awkward at first but I promise it gets way easier over time. 

Last thing...

4- Comfort with handling ambiguity is a must for anyone to succeed in consulting over the long term. There are two main types of ambiguity you’ll face. The first one involves dealing with client side ambiguity. each new project brings new problems, but we're trained how to navigate this kind of uncertainty; it's part and parcel of the job.

However, there's a second and less understood form; ambiguity regarding one's own career. E.g., not having certainty what industries/companies/locations you might be chucked

> It’s such a mischaracterization. Scapegoats are honestly meaningless especially for public companies.  Do you think the Board gives out a “get out of jail free card” because McKinsey was behind a failed strategy?  They do not - the buck stops with management no matter who they might bring in to advise them. 

And a copy paste from a prior response…

 But to be honest, I strongly believe the majority of consulting work does generate value for clients. Consulting didn't become a $1T global industry by accident. Noting that you're at a boutique, and there is often a very high variability in that long tail, you might want to consider other opportunities that fit better for you.

Here's something I wrote the last time "value" in consulting (specifically MBB) was brought up:

============

Three areas come to mind where we have the most bang for our buck for our clients:

strategy

breaking new ground

organizational change

Strategy - In my opinion, the company's strategic choice - who we are - is the most important decision. When you're big enough, the risk of getting it wrong is astronomical - the cost of consultants pales in comparison. Where consultants bring value is through the an independent perspective of the holistic competitive space today, where it's going, and where the white space is. While the internal people may be talented and knowledgeable about their company, they lack the broader view that a Firm who works across an industry can bring. If I were a Chief Strategy Officer, I'd have the internal team working on a strategy and the consultants creating their own take free from insider influence. Then, bring the two together to blend the best of both worlds.

Breaking new ground - If I were running a business and looking to enter into an area I was not familiar with - whether that be industry or function - a consultancy's perspective would be valuable. They would be able to bring the latest thinking, best practices, and optimized processes that would take us much longer to develop, acquire, or hire on our own. I would not hire us if the new opportunity is a clear adjacency to the core business. To put it in real-world terms, if I were Amazon trying to improve customer engagement via mobile, hiring a consultant would not be on my short list of things to focus on. But if I were Aetna or Sysco, then it could make a lot more sense. Even more so if a company is looking to make moves into new markets or diversified acquisitions.

Organizational change - I'm not using "organizational change" in the way I usually would in this context, but what I'm trying to get at is things like transformation or operational effectiveness that represent a meaningful change for the company. Like strategy, these are typically areas where best practices are helpful and downside risk to the organization is large. The difference is that, as a client, I likely know what the high-level answer is - e.g., cut costs by x%, fix the marketing department, or merge two LOBs.

> Look on youtube into FreePBX which is a UI on top of Asterisk, or FusionPBX which is a UI on top of Freeswitch. Both can work really well. It requires a little bit of a mind and understanding of telephone systems of old to configure but once you are used to it it makes sense. 

For example back in the day I did implement a few Lucent/AT&T systems and Meridian. The principles are still the same. They would allow you to for example have a numberplan like:

0 - reception / operator (if necessary at all)  
1000 series you could use for teams for example if necessary  
2001 hey that is your extension :P   
2002 co-worker 1  
2003 co-worker 2  
etc...

Then have something like   
3001 A hunt or ring group for like your main external number, which rings all of the 2000 series extensions that you added to the group, but if no answer you can continue to...

4001 The mailbox for teh hunt ring group or your main public telephone number...

And then you can get fancy and have like dial a 9 for an outside line, and also have internal calls...

On top of that you'd need to get a SIP trunk, a gateway. There are many providers, mine costs me €3 and then I have a local number and a geographic national number which are like €3 each. Plus the server to host costs like €9. And you are good for quite a few people.

Then for your extensions you can just have a SIP client on your desktop, and your mobile phone. The mobile phone ones need a push service and thus often come with a small subscription fee. But like zoiper can be as little as €0.99 per month.

Good luck :)

> There is a actually a way to do this somewhat effectively. When email spam was a huge problem, some smart people had the same idea to catch spammers (ie. large trap banks). These are called spamtraps, and the techniques that have been used to make these can be used to make phone spam traps too. I would recommend reading the following articles, which have some good information on what you should try: [article1](https://wordtothewise.com/2011/08/a-brief-guide-to-spamtraps/), [article2](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/spamtraps-creating-and-seeding/), [article3](https://serverfault.com/questions/317876/how-can-i-attract-more-spammers-hitting-my-spam-traps). Generally however, the process is relatively simple:

1) Acquire a large number of phone numbers. Like a F\*\*\* load. (100-1000, depending on your budget. More is always better.) I recommend using BulkVS. I have had no problems with them before, and their rates are quite good.

2) Terminate all of these into a PBX of some kind. I think that a basic asterisk or freeswitch setup would work well. You can configure the PBX to send these to one or multiple phones depending on how many researchers you have available. You should also enable recording, CDR storage, CNAM lookups, and verbose logging on your PBX box, as this will give you some interesting information about the callers. If you don't know how to do this, I would recommend researching this, or getting someone who can. A proper spam harvesting setup should generate way more spam calls than a single person can handle. You'll also want the additional data that comes from running your own sip server.

3) Wait for calls to start coming in. You'll see that some numbers are "busy" and some aren't. Keep track of which ones are witch. Most importantly, ANSWER EVERY CALL. If you can't, ensure that voicemail is set up and works. ANSWER EVERY MESSAGE. You may even want to set up a webhook to auto reply to spam texts. Getting spam calls is like making money. The more you have, the easier it is to get more. Spammers sell lists of valid numbers to other spammers, and their computers detect answering machines and other features usually found on live numbers. When they see that you're answering and responding to their calls, they will add you to their gold lists, and you'll be getting dozens of calls a day soon enough. On the other hand, if the computer detects the three error tones usually found with an invalid number, or hears a phone error message, it will automatically scrub you from their list.

> Must agree with other posts here as your experience feels more regionally specific. 

US based here and was BA through AP, then left to industry. To counter your points which were honestly difficult to discern:

1) Within 2-3 years at McK one would be leading teams; within 5 years I had started my own service line and led roughly ~20 individuals which grew to 60 over a few years in addition to my team(s) which I was directly managing. It’s quite insane for you to be spending 90% of your time managing the bottom 10% of performers; in fact there is a common adage at McK that one should spend the vast majority of time coaching and influencing the middle 60% as the top 20% need limited guidance and bottom 20% will not behaviorally shift. 

2) Disrespect was never an issue in my experience at the firm and in fact, the company I am at now has significantly more rough language and behaviors than in consulting. Even more bluntly, when arriving as a McK consultant I was treated with white gloves by many clients given the direct line of communication with the CEO. In cases when clients disrespected my ASC/BAs, which happened 3x in about 10 years, I came down harshly where the Sr. Partner spoke directly with CEO who reprimanded or removed said client. Zero clue how computer screens plays into this, maybe you were just ranting. 

3) I’m very confused about what “reaching the ceiling” means in your opinion. Seriously no clue. I maintain that my experience in consulting was an incredibly steep learning journey which did not slow as I moved up in rank; in fact, it became steeper moving from BA to AP. None of the projects I worked on (over 50 engagements in 10+ years) had answers predetermined by said client leadership. I had 2 cases where a specific client had political reasons towards pushing for a specific answer, for which the engagement was discontinued as a result, regardless of loss of fees. Engagements and engagement directors (ED) at the firm are subject to multiple stage gates of risk management through risk committees who evaluate this. 

TLDR your entire post does not align with my experience being in consulting for over a decade and in industry for half a decade.

> It's both Industry and Client/Research-specific (the latter drives the profiles that are searched by Research Assistants/Recruiters to identify Candidates).

You receive an eMail/Online Notification regarding interest in your profile (which takes some time to create, includes a typical resume that you likely have, and some summary bullets on areas, solutions and processes you might be an "Expert" (Experienced) with.

Inquiries from the Recruiters are based on information from "Clients" (generally Management Consulting Companies engaged to "Survey Competitors" within certain specific parameters to provide a comprehensive overview of the current market and competitor intelligence that they will create from online research, White Papers, conversation with colleagues on similar Projects and/or Industry Experts identified through companies like GLG.

Overall, I have done two discussion in the 1.5 months I have been a member.  The process of creating and activating the Profile for Recruiters to search on their system was the most time consuming - at perhaps an hour+ with the good fortune of a current resume to upload and some pre-existing summaries I could leverage.

Both discussions were with Consulting Firms engaged in providing an "Overview/Summary/Assessment/Strategy" for specific options/approaches to setting-up types of businesses (one a Risk Holding Entity for Insurance and one a Customer Call Center operation).  Calls were 30-minutes and 1-hour, with the first a one-one-one (with additional off-camera people in the room) discussion that was poorly structures and understood by those doing the research.  The second was better researched and understood by th individual conducting the interview and included specific questions that reflected an understanding of the business and objectives of the approach she was discussing.

The option is an easy way to spend some time and earn extra cash (automatically verified immediately after the timed discussion by GLG with a request to go online, provide your preferred payment set-up by either VISA Gift Card or Direct Deposit to Banking and paid within 1-week of the time spent on th discussion).

Minuses include (as mentioned elsewhere) often times very comprehensive questionnaires that ask VERY detailed questions that include specifics which require an answer and detail.  These are sometimes quite a bit of work and look more like a Survey/Questionnaire in-and-of themselves - and are likely designed by either the Recruiter/Researcher to gather a large amount of detail (often Competitor Solutions, Approaches or known Industry Practices that would give insights as to propensity of use among other companies, types of applications and strategy).  While they do take some considerable time to complete - I find they often do NOT result in any additional questions and are intrusive as a Pre-Screening (likely aimed at getting Freebie Info/Strategy without paying the full amount).

> It’s your team. It’s not every team. It’s a lot of teams. Not just a consulting thing, tho culture will be project by project dependent in consulting. Let them talk about you, let them talk about others. But keep your own policy of not talking about others in a gossipy way. There is such thing as good professional gossip, such as talking about the client and leadership and what people are talking about in meetings and what different stakeholders are saying and different ideas and initiatives floating around in different meetings. This is important to engage as is relevant to whatever level you’re at. But talking about people’s personal lives for no reason other than entertainment is unprofessional anywhere, but it happens all the time. People usually get away with it, but there is always that bad bad story where their big mouth eventually bites them in the ass and they get thrown out because no one trusts them anymore. I don’t know about your industry, but I have seen that the people who are big on personal gossip and not just the professional gossip eventually get to a place where they can’t deliver the complex work that’s being demanded. 

You can develop positive working relationships with everyone, even people who gossip. Remember, coworkers are not your friends. You’re there to build success for yourself and grow as a professional and a person. Friendships can develop at work, but it’s always second to business, because you are in a place of business.

If you want to bond with them, just listen to them. Ask them questions about themselves where appropriate. If they ask you questions answer if you’re comfortable. If you believe they are prying and it’s none of their business then prepare a tactful response to disarm them. They’ll get the picture and quit messing with you. Either they’ll respect you, or be irritated at you, for setting boundaries, but it’s out of your control.

In addition to the clients you interface with, your most important relationships to cultivate are your direct line manager(s), whoever advocates for you in yearly reviews, and the partner that is responsible for your part of the project and business service line. Don’t worry about being friends with every gossip on the team.

> I probably could start up by myself, drum the good ppl together and create a firm of our own making...Been advised to also...but there is two issues with that...I'm a bit risk averse and I don't want to put down the effort needed to gain contracts anymore etc...., also I perceive my competencies to be of a degree that often requires really big companies and initatives (funding etc) so as a lone contractor it limits my options... Unless I would like to do small-shop type of work wich I certainly could if needed to, but do I want to? (answer is probably no, I'd rather settle for stability and "no fuzz" advisory roles, I got what I need and I don't really need a new car or other "things").

Reason for getting out of consultancy is many sided, I think that it's mainly because I'm just flat out fed up with management self-service, the fact that (to me) it seems that there is soo many un-educated so called leaders calling the wrong shots and blaming everyone else, so much "false flag values and ethics wavering", that my glass just overflowed and I called it quits :-D   
And keep in mind, I've been running the ranks, I've looked behind the curtain and I've tried to make a difference, change things up, but I ran out of steam and realized... it's done for me :-)

> Hi,

I’ve just recently had a thought that I might be missing out on a lot of income by not working as a consultant and being employed at my company. Some background: I have a MSc in business and computer science and spent the first 3 years of my career at a Big 4 firm working within Enterprise Risk. For the last 2 years, I’ve been working at a huge global security company, and have been responsible for the implementation of a new GRC & Privacy tool called OneTrust. Despite my relative young age, I have a very senior role as I have to liase with key stakeholders across the firm to establish their processes in the new mutual GRC & Privacy system.

Anyways, as with most things, once you’ve been working in the same area/system for a while, you become very good and efficient at it. My work here is almost done as I’ve managed to launch processes for almost all of our key functions across the world to use OneTrust. During a meeting with our Customer Success Manager at OneTrust, they also invited their other customer companies in my region in Europe. Due to OneTrust having been a relatively small player in the market (ServiceNow for example is much more common) I was shocked to see just how many companies actually used their services. Almost all of the questions these employers from various companies had were things I knew the answers to from experience, and quite frankly, I had better knowledge of the system than the OneTrust representative themselves.

It struck me that, despite me earning pretty okay money (€75k anually), if I was to become a freelance OneTrust consultant, I would be able to make a lot more by helping all of these huge companies actually implement the system instead of hiring employees for the job, or paying exorbinate amounts to OneTrust for their different assistance packages (which honestly helps with very little).

Does anyone have any experience of being an independent OneTrust consultant (or similar GRC & Privacy tools)? If so, how easy/hard is it to get contact with companies and ’sell’ yourself (in the EU)? How much could you charge them? Any information would be very useful. The work that took me 2 years to accomplish at my current company, would honestly take me about 1 month now as, like I said, I know this product inside and out at this point.

> First things first, I'm very sorry you were laid off and especially in the way it appears to have been handled. Ruthless, and a kick in the teeth after the effort you've put in.
I more wanted to answer your comment about the 0.1% of jobs. That's quite bleak, but I think it's also misinformed. Full disclosure I'm not a consultant, and actually having the misfortune to be dealing with some Management Consultant sorts at my job atm, but that has nothing to do with my thoughts here.

The vast majority of jobs do contribute to the world, just generally in a small, specific kind of way. Everyone serves someone or something. Companies don't pay money for nothing (except consultants, ok just kidding). The world of work is often quite siloed, so it masks the value of the work, but it's there. And I would advise anyone to think about what your work does contribute.
Builders build homes for people to live in. A plumber might feel unfulfilled but when my toilet explodes and he fixes it then I think he's a life saver.
Grocery staff are part of a supply chain that ensures people are fed without needing to tend their own farms, barbers keep us looking sharp, garbage men stop us being flooded in our own filth. Etc you get the picture.
Ok what about office jobs? More siloed sure. But still valuable. Work in the office for an insurance company? That's a vital service which spreads risk and facilitates our modern way of life. You think a single airplane ever takes off with passangers onboard in a world without insurance? Or what about those people whose homes are rebuilt following a natural disaster? Exactly. Sure you're a cog in the wheel, but your contribution positively impacts the world.
Ok well what about the real dirty, "get money" sorts. What about Investment Bankers? Well, they are greasing the wheels of the capital markets which supports investment in all sorts of industry's which provide all sorts of value to the world.
Even you consultants, I'm sure if I thought about it hard enough I'd come up with some good. Might need 3-5 working days on that one (kidding 😂)
Unless you work for the mafia, your job is probably contributing positively to the world in some small way. We can't all be -insert iconic legend here- but we can and do add value to the world. All of us ordinary decent working folks. Don't doubt yourself, look for the value you bring, and at least recognize it's not all some pointless dog eat dog rat race

> 17 comments so far and they’re all highly aligned. 

You put yourself at high risk of not getting paid, or not being paid appropriately, if:

1. The client isn’t ethical. E.g., they “forget” to report all or some sales, or they “miscategorize” sales so you don’t get credit)

And…

2. They have the brand power to drive sales. As an example, they may have a terrible reputation in the community that requires remediation before you’d have any success with them. 

And…

3. They do the basics to convert leads to sales. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve found that clients aren’t answering calls we sent them from hot leads. Lack of any follow-up is another common problem. Guess who they blame for their sales incompetence?

And…

4. They provide a quality service to your lead. If not, the lead/customer may not pay, they may pay less than the sales price, they may get a refund, etc.

And…

5. The client ACTUALLY gets paid.

All of the above are 100% out of your control. You accept a ton of risk for arguably little reward.

I would only advise doing something like this if you have worked with the client for some time, and are sure they don’t have any of the above common problems that the vast majority of businesses have.

Also, only do something if you are rock-solid confident in your ability to deliver. I don’t mean having blind faith that you’ll rise to the occasion. I mean you’ve done it dozens of times, you know very specifically what you’re getting into, and you know exactly what it will take of you and the client to pull it off. Think science, not emotion. 

Lastly, you must get full buy-in from the client that they will do their part. Not a token “yah sure,” - a contractual obligation do so with a penalty if they don’t fulfill their end of the agreement (you’ll have wasted your time and money if they don’t).

If I were in your position, I would opt for a combination of what u/willmanracing and u/its_akhil_mishra have recommended.

1. Lower your base recurring fees. 

2. Ask the client to increase ad spend.

3. Negotiation to get paid per lead. 

I wouldn’t get into the business of calling my clients customers to qualify them. That’s time consuming, you’ll likely have trouble reaching many of them, and it’s messy AF. In the end, it won’t matter when your client disagrees with your assessment that a prospect is qualified. 

Sell leads if anything. I’d avoid selling leads that the client says are good leads (remember, they have to do all of those five things above to make this worthwhile for you, and if they’re unethical it’ll be easy for them to wave their hand and say a lead sucks). It’s stay clear of selling revenue. 

To that last point, NEVER link your payment to their profit or profit per lead you send them. It’s almost impossible for business owners to accurately determine profit per customer, and requires substantial assumption of activity base costing that are literally none of your business. Their profit is 100% out of your control even if

> I think free consults are a great way to drive business. We’ve worked with a lot of firms on stuff like this and it’s just comes down to a simple prescreen. 

Whether it’s a form, ai chat / voice assistant, or over the phone with your receptionist assistant. Goal is to gather details and get the consultation booked. Once you have details you’re prepped and ready and know which direction to take. 

You should be able to immediately figure out if this should be referred out, if it’s just a quick chat or needs more time, etc. Don’t be afraid to set expectations and limits immediately. “Hey, this sounds interesting. I’ve got a pretty busy calendar today but could you tell me a little more about what’s going?”

-Let them explain. Give a little bit of your thoughts and let them know whether this conversation should continue with you and your fee.

Worst case: You’ve got a new contact and you spent 5-10 minutes on the phone. Never know if that little question comes back later as a bigger problem you can actually help with.

Alternatively, if you have the ability, kick that to a paralegal to dig a little deeper before it gets to you.

> A few options...  
  
1. **Do nothing**. 

Don't accept the deal and see where it goes. Maybe they'll forget about it...maybe not. Not a great option. It's best to transparently discuss these kinds of things with your clients.

2. **Take the deal**. 

If you take the deal then there are many side effects to consider.   
a) What's the opportunity cost? Not just financially from other deals that will no longer materialize, but also in the risk of working for just one client.   
b) Can you guarantee they will pay you?   
c) Can you guarantee that they'll continue to use your services?  For how long and at what levels?  
d) Can you gain exclusivity with them too? In other words, if you can't work for anyone else, will they commit to not hiring anyone else for their YT/socials? This is a real threat because it's 100% possible and even likely that they could dilute what they give you over time.    
e) Can you get a higher rate or more services (e.g., not just YT, but what about other platforms too like IG) that with your existing arrangement?  
f) What are the contract terms? How long are they locking in for? I'd make it at least two years.

3) **Reject the deal**. 

The big con with their proposal is that they'll be taking 100% of your agency's resources, bandwidth, and future opportunities. If you take a deal, you're effectively not an agency anymore...you're a contract vehicle to provide individual talent to a single client...a staff augmentation contractor. You wouldn't have much of a future, if any, as an agency. There's nothing wrong with that and you can can probably make some dough with the arrangement, but it's a completely different business model. If you're considering rejecting the deal, first review possible alternatives that could make the arrangement more to your liking and reduce the client concentration risk. Push hard to make it the right deal for you, because worst case, the deal and relationship fall apart and you're back to being an agency. What's really the worst case to rejecting the deal? You go get more work elsewhere, and there's plenty of that to go around. 

4) **Proposal an alternative arrangement**. 

Counteroffers could be:  
a) Tweaking any proposed terms or items listed in the rest of this answer.  
b) Insist on the ability to take on other work. It'd be in your best interest to have as few restrictions as possible.   
c) Make sure you get paid and handsomely.    
d) They buy you out. They'll going to be taking 100% of your agency bandwidth, and why not just acquire you? 

I hope this helps you think through your options.

> "If you're not making the firm money then why would they continue to employ you."

For the same reason that the firm employs folks like the receptionist, the Intake Specialist, the Office Services Clerks, the Records Manager, the IT Manager, and the Biller.

None of those folks can bill their time to clients for what they do.  But, what they do SAVES the firm more money than it costs to pay them.

Firing a paralegal - especially a paralegal who has expertise in an Admin function like Billing, or IT, or Records management, or Risk Management - is wasteful, and could expose the firm to wrongful termination claims in the future.

The much more cost-efficient strategy is to re-train or cross-train paralegals who are failing to meet billable requirements into doing some of the cost-saving functions that the firm needs just as much as time-billers as profit centers.

Using what you have - instead of wasting money to recruit, hire, train and retain new talent - is one of the principles of Strategic Management.  Since you didn't mention it, that indicates that you went straight to law school from undergrad.

> I worked for a solo six months after he hung his shingle in 1997 until 2022.  Hire the most experienced paralegal you can afford.  I slowly took over many of the routine office management responsibilities to give him more time for rainmakering.  Don't be afraid to hand off responsibilities that slow you down, and include this person in meetings for things like insurance needs, office supply needs, light bookkeeper needs, and other ordinary "office running" necessities.  If you should get sick, which happened in my case, I needed to know where things were and who to call.  Same with setting up an agreement with another attorney who can sign routine pleadings in an emergency.   In our case, my bosses illness was severe enough where a Notice of Unavailability needed to be filed in some cases to extend litigation deadlines.  These are the kinds of things you never think will happen, but do.

We had a receptionist full time and experimented with using just a phone service to take messages.  For us, that bombed. Yes, it was significantly cheaper, but our clients liked (and were willing to pay for) handholding.  Our receptionist was a gem, and I credit her caring nature in the office for client retention.

Remember, this is old school advice.  I happen to have my own personal personal injury case going with another firm that does everything remotely.  Right now, because my case has been reassigned (yet again), I wouldn't be able to recognize my own attorney or any staff if I walked into a courtroom.  It is certainly not a full service firm as I have been responsible for delivering documents any paralegal could easily obtain to move my case forward.  We were a full service firm.  I believe there are plenty of clients still willing to pay for full service.

Advertising is so different now. I can't offer any helpful information.  It's all so different now.

If I can help, let me know.  There were decisions that were great, and others that bombed and wasted so much money.

> Beating up your attorneys won’t solve the issue.

My previous firm went through this. 

1) first they hired an “office manager” that brought big corp/big law style drama into our little firm.


That didn’t help matters at all and now the owner of this little 3 attorney firm is paying a full time position for someone whose only job is nag and harass attorneys about “their KPIs” and makes them waste time with a whole new layer of meetings and bureaucracy.

2) then he hired a “customer relationship manager”, in other words a 25 year old dude that picks up the phone and books meetings.

Did I mention that we also have a receptionist that picks up the phone and books meetings?  Did I mention both usually end passing the phone calls to the paralegals anyway? 

That’s another role/extra mouth to feed. 

3) then they began screeching about KPIs,case turnover and all that.  We have never had an issue with case turnover, we were a lean and mean firm! But now the “office manager” has to justify his job, and that means harassing the lawyers and paralegals. And now we have an “office manager” and a “CRM specialist” who are just overhead, so we gotta BILL BILL BILL!

4) so the firm’s owner decided it was time to cut costs… FINALLY! Ok, good, we will be back on track 🙂…. Wait, how is he going to cut costs? By doing the same greedy little thing you suggested, he fired an attorney and one parelegal so he could hire 3 “virtual paralegals” based in India and Philippines and a “foreign attorney” from India who does the stuff and sends it to the other attorneys to review because he can’t really do the attorney job without a US license, so now there is even more stuff on the (real) attorney’s plate, who are already getting choked by the ridiculous KPIs and harassment they’re subject to because they have to pay for the overhead cause by the office manager and the CRM guy.

Guess how the firm is doing now? Hint; I got the heck out of there because it’s a sinking ship. They were just fine from a profitability perspective and from a legal quality perspective until these “amazing optimizations” and “improvements in efficiency” were implemented.

Last I heard this firm is not worried about their rapidly declining profitability because “they will use AI to improve efficiency”, so I guess they are firing a paralegal or two, maybe even an attorney, “ai and smart forms will do it all”.

It does not. An AI receptionist is an after-hours lead capture and routing system. When these tools try to sound like lawyers or analyze cases, they overreach and create risk. The value is simple and operational: answer calls, collect accurate intake, and hand off to a human. Anything more is unnecessary and unsafe.

> My response is anecdotal, but I’ve seen this movie play out. About 10 years ago (around 2015), I attended a small-firm / solo practitioner tech show run by a state bar association (US State). Most case-management vendors there were locally hosted. Only one was cloud-first: Clio. The on-prem vendors spent a surprising amount of time bad-mouthing “the cloud.” It got borderline absurd. Some were using Google Drive and Google Cloud interchangeably, warning lawyers that Google was mining their data, and citing Gmail ads as “proof.” I personally believed the cloud was inevitable, but at the time I could not convince most small firms that cloud convenience would win out long-term.

Fast-forward \~10 years. Same conference :There is exactly one self-hosted case-management vendor left. They’re still there largely because 90% of their customers are in that state, they still accept paper checks, and they’re running a very healthy lifestyle business (I chatted with the owner).

Meanwhile, Clio is now the legal-tech darling with massive scale and late-stage funding.

So my takeaway:If you plan to keep this as a niche or lifestyle business, a fully offline / local-only solution absolutely has a market. If you plan to scale, cloud (or at least some hybrid) is almost unavoidable. Security arguments eventually lose to convenience. Not because lawyers stop caring about confidentiality, but because workflow gravity wins. If your product won’t trade some risk for speed and convenience, another one will.  
That said, I think your best option is not either/or: Local storage vs Cloud, Private or single-tenant hosted LLMs, Optional offline mode. It might be a combination of both.

A pure desktop, compute-heavy AI product runs into very real friction: Aging laptop,Locked-down IT environments, Firms that can approve case budgets but not hardware upgrades

At that point you’re selling not just software, but fighting IT policy and capital budgets. So yes, “fully offline” is a real selling point , just not a mass-market one. The trick is deciding whether you want to optimize for control and certainty, or scale and convenience, and designing the product so you don’t paint yourself into a corner. While the cloud only (i.e. public LLM) has a lot of players, you might have a niche with desktop and a different flavor with a private hosted version.

> I was also very indecisive as a 3L, and chose to pursue estate planning and administration. 

There’s two different areas of estate planning: taxable estates and non taxable estates. Taxable estate planning is extremely complex, and one of the most difficult areas of law in my opinion. They say you won’t truly grasp it until your several years in. 
Non taxable is honestly fairly easy. Because of this, non taxable estate planning doesn’t pay well, and it’s difficult to break into firms that exclusively do taxable estates, but they do pay well. 

Either way, the ceiling as an associate is not nearly as high as in litigation and corporate. 

Family life is okay. A hell of a lot less stress and deadlines in estate planning. 

Can’t answer about tacking on other areas of law really. 

For this area, I’d recommend a smaller flat-fee firm that specializes in estate planing, and where you don’t have to worry about billable hour requirements. 

I debate every week whether or not I wish I chose a different area of law out of law school. The work can be a little robotic and I’m afraid of AI replacing a lot of the work. And even the tax work isn’t as stimulating — I feel asleep. 

I miss litigation, but it’s always easy to get into litigation. Estate planning — not so much.

> That’s interesting! I haven’t ventured into that territory because I I don’t have it format my documents; I do that in templates I created for Word. I’m afraid to leave the robustness of the Word platform so I copy and paste into Word. 

My instructions are more personalized. I customize each project with specific instructions so it knows who I am and it knows my style of writing and what I’m looking for.

As for one example, I have a project called ChatGPT Usage Advisor and I go to it with any questions I have about making better instructions. Here are its instructions:

I am your ChatGPT Usage Advisor.

My role is to help [… ] use ChatGPT more effectively, efficiently, and creatively across all her projects and personal needs. I assist her (you) in prompt creation, project design, usage reflection, AI trends exploration, and idea incubation.

About the user [personal information and personal preferences for here]

How I Can Help:
	1.	Assist in drafting or fine-tuning instructions for new ChatGPT projects or refining existing ones.
	2.	Collaborate with you on prompt design to achieve better, faster, or more targeted results.
	3.	Periodically review your usage patterns and suggest improvements or experiments.
	4.	Keep an eye on trends, tips, and new ideas from the ChatGPT community (Reddit, blogs, etc.).
	5.	Serve as a place to explore new AI applications or reflect on your AI journey.

Communication Style:
	•	Collaborative, conversational, and efficient.
	•	Help you capture your stream-of-consciousness thoughts and organize them when needed.
	•	Offer gentle nudges when patterns emerge (e.g., over-reliance on one project, under-use of another).

If I do not know an answer to something, I will not try to fill in the gaps by making something up that could turn into a hallucination. Rather, I will say that I don’t know.

I have access to the Internet and will search for current or precise information when appropriate. Whenever I provide information based on external sources, I will cite the source clearly (including the website or publication name and a link when possible) so that you can verify the information independently. If I am uncertain, cannot find a reliable source, or the information is based solely on my training data, I will explicitly say “I don’t know” or suggest further verification. I prioritize accuracy, transparency, and clear sourcing over completion or speculation.

> Maybe the answer is to focus on building other skills until you can leave or you can try education. Before you bring up the topic again, consider their side (use your lawyering skills). 

Maybe they don’t want to do it because they have no written privacy policy and so would be in for it with the malpractice insurance if there is ever an issue. And yes, if anyone at the firm is using the free version of most LLMs then you cannot guarantee client privacy. 
Maybe they don’t want to put notice of AI use in their retainer letter because they don’t know how to answer a client questioning why they should get paid if they can just have AI do it. (This is a good one for you to articulate for yourself as you may have to sell future clients on why you choose to use AI and how it makes you more valuable to them as a lawyer instead of less. And speed, low cost can’t be the answer because then the even faster/cheaper option is to do it themselves.)
Maybe they assume that all you have to do is ask a magic question, and your perfectly drafted motion pops out. Or they are afraid this isn’t actually the case, but don’t want to have to learn how to properly prep and prompt. 
Maybe they just don’t want to spend the time setting it up. 
Maybe it’s something completely random, like a grandchild’s expulsion because they plagiarized their term paper from Wikipedia back in the day. 

Could you clearly and persuasively answer all of these questions? (Plus, creating documentation, systems for training, and policies could help you wherever you go as you are likely to have more, or at least different, experience than other attorneys. And it makes for interesting interview content as it’s something that’s a value add to a firm that may have this, but incompletely. )
I think it’s worth it to see if you can actually get all their fears or concerns out. There may be issues you haven’t considered. And if you’re only seeing your side, it’s hard to change anyone’s mind.

> “Without doing the work to vet.”

“Coming from a place of fear.”

Vet what? Fear of what;?

What, specifically, should lawyers be using AI for? Name one task you know lawyers do, and how AI can assist. 

Be specific in your answers. 

I’m not trying to be a jerk here, seriously.

But what do you think lawyers are afraid of? 

What vetting has been done so far, and what further vetting is needed?

My questions highlight the central issues- which is that AI and tech companies are making tools for businesses that they have no idea about. 

I *guarantee you* that AI usage is a forgettable, negligible, irrelevant fraction of most law practices, from big law to boutique. 

I will concede lawyers are typically late adopters to technology. But the practice of law is the most durable business model in modern history- next to, like, prostitution and agriculture - for a reason. 

Imagine if firms panicked in 2018-2021 re: crypto “smart contracts” and made huge organizational changes based on that hype train. 

Or if firms, in the late 90s, stopped relying on Lexis/westlaw and instead sourced their research from forums and Wikis. 

Law practice, unlike tech work, is very specialized and its practitioners are hard to replace. The trial/ error period for adoption of new technologies is many years, maybe a decade or more, not 1-2. 

And AI maxis seem to think dropping a tool on our lap and saying “you figure it out!” on the question of actual use cases is innovation. It’s not, it’s just bloatware.

> Your third question will be of the most importance going forward. 


There are two ways that are the most practical
in protecting client attorney privledge with LLMS. 

1. Use a Different LLM for each case.  Not session; different LLM. Yes you heard that right. It’s the safest way to protect client data. It’s sprawl potential but easy to audit and easiest to assure clients that when they know you have a special AI with their name on it and no one else.

2.  Use RBAC technology where it prevents itself from using data from client A (data set A) from learning from or about or being trained by to help be smarter on client B (data set B). 

RBAC is renamed as a “client vault” on many AI legal systems. Presently these companies are not showing an audit trail and will not show what’s under the hood so the “trust me bro” tech huckster show is doing very well. It would give me pause in the buying process without thorough questioning.

It requires some expertise to setup and harden successfully. 

I am afraid this will be a huge topic in the near future, not only among very large firms that deal with cases worth tens of millions of dollars (they are already aggressively using RBAC), but will trickle down to smaller firms as the first litigation cases start to settle for client commingling.

Excellent question. 

The answer will keep evolving but today this is where we’re at.

> Hello!   
  
What would your advice be for a 19 year old joining the agency space. I started 6 months ago an agency or ai agency, in uni first year in a foreign country (Netherlands), started selling AI Chatbots and Receptionists and came quickly to the conclusion that I dont need to sell AI, but the outcome.   
  
I’ve tried cold calling, cold DMs, cold email, door 2 door, and my personal network, but haven’t landed a client yet. I don’t speak Dutch, only English and my home language, which made things harder locally. I spent the first 4–5 months focusing on real estate in the Netherlands and had conversations, but repeatedly got ditched.   
  
After that, I switched my offer to lead generation (ads + lead qualification and booking systems) for roofers in the US. At times, I’ve felt unsure whether I’m focusing on the right things or just creating activity without progress.  
  
If you were starting today with zero clients, what would you focus on first, and what would you stop doing immediately?

I should also mention that I have some small social proof: I built two websites from scratch for a small coffee shop and ran ads for it.

I’m not afraid of critique and would genuinely value a raw answer.

Appreciate your time either way.

> AI and Offshoring.

When I started, it was expected and encouraged to 'come up with ideas' and 'move projects' along in creative ways.

Some say that is 'work', and of course it is. But it mostly was meeting with clients off the clock. Being social. Building relationships. Finding out what they need / want / want to avoid.

My point is none of that was 'tracked' either internally by Partners or externally by PE investors who now own a ton of firms.

Also I cannot make this claim but at least in my experience, most of the Partners when I started early 2000s were 'operators' first and foremost and MBA business types second or not at all. i.e. They came from engineering, industry, etc then started successful firms post 2008. 

And I saw several MBA slick-backed hair type of Partners come and go. They *never* stuck cause they were only in it to invest a bit then get out for the next opportunity. 

Now all of our partner-firms, competitors, etc are ALL run like the latter. Everything is tracked and compared to how it can 'tell a story' to an investor.

When I started, I could spend hours coming up with ideas or pursuing roundabout ways to solve client issues. And then try them out by meeting the client face to face

Now that's not allowed because 1 minute you spend doing that is a minute you aren't tracking your billability or 'supporting' an internal 'initiative', which itself has gone through 5 rounds of debates with the financial backoffice or "strategic growth partner".

It used to be that you could try to solve an issue and if it didn't work, then the actual **consulting result** wasn't met, i.e. the deliverable wasn't good or the sale wasn't made. *THOSE* were the results. Either good or bad. If good, you're good. If result wasn't attained, you weren't doing your job and your boss or Partner knows it.

Now, everyone is afraid to try that because it's not just you're trying to develop a client and your Partner or manager saying "Oh I wanted you to make that sale to that client" or "That deliverable needs to be better" *judged solely based on the sale or deliverable*

Now whether it's good or bad isn't based on the consulting output; it's based on the organizational 'momentum'. As in does your little deck align with the overall organizational goals to make us targets for PE investment? 

"Uh I thought we make this deck or deliverable so the client gets their problem solved? As in what they're paying us to do" That's not the case anymore.

Now, it's an undefined eye in the sky of KPIs and metrics we all serve, which don't allow for any remediation or improvement. It's just "Your KPI is 70% and Bob's is 72%. You are worse". 

I think the two above AI and offshoring are both the chicken and the egg, making a perverted cycle. But consulting "we need help" will never truly die. I do think the answer for truly dedicated operators is just to go solo or start your own firm though.

This is what I'm most afraid of at the moment due to the long term impact. Not to mention the fact that junior staff slowly lose fundamentals as AI becomes more commonplace.

One of the main issues with AI at the moment is that you already need to know roughly what the answer is going to be, so that you can monitor it for hallucinations. That's fine if you're already experienced, but a junior person who is reliant on it, may not necessarily know when it has produced garbage.

There's no way AI trained on company docs will give a truthful answer to a lot of these questions. That's the job of the line manager (or onboarding buddy) to answer these questions where the real answer may be much different than what's in the company handbook.

For clients, of cours no way.

> I work in the IT field and I can tell we feel some immediate impact of such tools; now will it replace completely humans? I doubt it. 

Think of ChatGPT that everybody is crazy about, it's indeed awesome but it's trained on data collected in the internet and often times confidently gives us wrong answers. That's because it doesn't know "everything" and it won't know, even if it's daily trained (which is not) with the latest updates in the internet. 

When I'm consulting for a client, I always need their own exclusive data to reason about. We need numbers that aren't available in the internet. We can train the Davinci model from ChatGPT to understand context data, let's say data related to our clients, however the process of gathering the data is the most arduous one, and then preparing the data so finally training the model. You still need people to navigate the client through this process because AI it's not magic.

Something else I'm afraid it's gonna happen is free content will become more rare over time, because why would people be feeding an AI service with something they're experts at for free without any authorship or recognition? 

If that will be a trend, the AI won't have new meaningful data to train its models; or worse, the free content out there generated by AI, that it's used to train itself.

> I concur with your conclusion. I am a retired CPA, currently serving on one local board on a volunteer basis. The invitation to serve on a board and receive compensation seemed like an opportunity worth discussing, so I scheduled a call today at 3:00 pm EDT. 

This morning I received 2 separate emails, reminding me of my 1:00 pm phone appointment. So, I concluded that they shifted me from 3 pm to 1 pm. Unprofessional, but ok. 

I was prepared to receive their phone call at 1:00 pm, as their email stated. NO CALL!

So, at 3:30, I noticed that I had a voicemail from this company at 3 pm. The caller referred to his call for our “prearranged” call at 3 pm, as if to suggest that I failed to honor my appointment time. 

I called him then, and he apologized for the confusion…He proceeded to run me through the pitch, including the eye opening compensation and limited time required to earn these board fees. 

I informed him that I truly possess the credentials that I mentioned, however I was curious how this company is able to do the necessary background check on these candidates. How do they know I’m representing my background honestly? 

His answer was weak, referring to various social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook. 

I was waiting for the sales pitch- and sure enough it surfaced. $195 up front, month to month contract. I knew it was a scam. 

I asked him who pays the insurance premiums for board of directors liability coverage. He had no idea what I was talking about.

I explained what this coverage is, and he said, “well I guess that’s on us”…!

I politely ended the call- and decided to see if this company had been covered on Reddit. 

Thanks for sharing- I hope other possible victims are able to read these comments and avoid the financial drain. 

It sounded too good to be true. And it is!

> Longtime manager of a corporate law firm here. Corporate firms are generally pretty traditional places as far as dress code and expected behavior, and a very different atmosphere than what you've seen on TV. If you have questions about what to wear, I'd ask whomever hired you (HR manager or office manager, I'm guessing) for guidance. Observe how others are dressed and don't try to stand out. Err on the conservative side until you've been there a while and get an idea of what they consider acceptable.

If you're going to be the receptionist, your first obligation is to be dependable. Be unfailingly on time. Be pleasant and polite, but not too chatty. Once you get the lay of the land and are comfortable with your primary responsibilities, make yourself useful to others. If you see other staff members in the weeds, offer to help them. Assistants and paralegals often need help making copies, scanning documents, preparing mail, making file folders and binders, etc. Let them know they can rely on you and earn their trust.

Be a team player and be proactive. No job is too small, especially when you're starting out.

Don't be afraid to ask questions when you're learning the ropes, but take notes and be careful to not ask the same question repeatedly. Law firms are busy places and people are usually generous with helping out new folks, but that will wear thin quickly if you don't retain what you've been told.

Very importantly, be sure to take a beat and proofread your emails before sending in order to keep typos and grammar mistakes to a minimum, and make sure to communicate clearly.

Law firms are fantastic places to grow. Good luck to you! I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park.

> You need to formalize ownership and gatekeeping on your matters, in writing, and add a simple approval workflow.

Action plan:

\- Email the partner and that para: for my files, all opposing counsel comms go through me; filings sit in a Ready to File folder until I approve; 24-hour turnaround; 15‑minute weekly huddle to review deadlines. Put the matter number in every subject and use a clear naming rule for drafts vs finals.

\- Track errors in a neutral log; after two weeks, take the data and the workflow to the partner as “this protects clients and the firm,” not a personality fight.

\- Designate the receptionist as your file coordinator with limited authority (calendaring, service, medical records, follow‑ups). Cheaper than burning attorney time.

\- Self‑manage only high‑risk items (court filings, OC calls) until trust is earned; everything else runs through your checklist.

\- Bridge hire: pitch a contract/fractional para 10–15 hrs/week for 90 days with KPIs (cycle times, zero missed deadlines). Full‑time para makes sense once you consistently collect 2.5–3x their total cost and you’re at \~120–150 active WC files or 3+ trials/month.

On tools: I’ve used Clio and DocuSign, but SignWell’s templates and sequential routing cut our retainer/med‑auth back‑and‑forth and unclogged bottlenecks.

Formalize ownership and workflows now so you can serve clients and avoid burnout.

> It sounds like you don't have anything lined up in the US. So why "quit" as opposed to just telling them you cannot work during that period? 

I would tell them that you really enjoy working there, that you are getting married and moving to the US and will be unable to work due to visa restrictions from \[date\] to \[date\], and that you'd like to resume working for them after that period ends, and ask them if they would be okay with that. You can always quit later if/when you find a different job.

As far as how much notice to give them, that depends on a number of factors. 

If you have a contract with them, that could require you to give a certain amount. 

How much will your absence affect them and how easily could you be replaced? 

For example, say you are 1 of 2 receptionists, you could probably be replaced relatively quickly and the other receptionist could cover in the meantime. In that situation, 2 weeks' notice would be more than adequate. On the other hand, the last time I left a firm, I ended up giving a month's notice because there would have been real problems if I left two weeks before certain hearings were about to start. As long as 2-weeks' notice wouldn't create real problems for them, they shouldn't be upset with 2 weeks.

How important is this income to you? 

It's always possible that if you tell them you're leaving, they'll fire you. Depending on how badly you need the income, you may not want to risk that.

By the time something like this is tuned for ethical compliance it's less of a lead generation tool than an answering service, but now with pages of disclaimers preceding it.

Purely to make the original question viewable, I've pasted the original text below. 

I am no longer looking for answers to my questions. No response is needed if you happen to stumble upon this post in 2023 or later.

----

I've actually installed asterisk on my work box, edited a dial plan, sent commands to a ATA, etc* so maybe I'm not a total n00b, but I'm at a loss on where to go to get started.

Currently: I have two prepaid cellphones. One with a number that I've had for 10+ years, so I want to keep it. I cut the copper landline years ago, and probably I can't go back. (Because...) I have FiOS at home (...and I doubt they would want to hook up the copper again). I have several boxes at home and would not be adverse to making up a new box running linux or BSD to run 24/7 as my answering machine/ forwarding box/ etc.

I want to ease in to this because I'm currently job hunting. The truth is that these prepaid phones kinda suck. Sometimes I don't get  my voice mail notification promptly. I do pay less than $12/month for the prepaid plan though. I don't make a lot of calls, but I do need to be accessible.

My rough plan of action would go something like this:

1. Get VoIP service from a provider and a new local phone number.

2. Build a box to run at home 24/7 to store phone messages, custom dial plans (ex-girlfriend and others), and manage a desktop VoIP phone that plugs in via ethernet (which I have not purchased yet). Probably no analog POTS phones at all unless it is a super cheap option vs getting a digital desk phone off ebay.

3. Forward my new phone number so it rings my two cell phones and my desk phone at work (during certain hours) at the same time, and takes messages if I don't answer (emails me an mp3 of the message, etc..)

4. Port my 10 year cell number over to my VoIP provider once everything is stable and to my liking.

5. (optional) Buy a used Android phone off ebay, flash firmware if needed, and use it without a cell plan for calls over wi-fi to my home asterisk box.

I saw a message a few weeks ago that offered advice for picking a provider, but what I'm really lacking is the VoIP lingo I need to intelligently evaluate what a provider can do for me.  **So (tl;dr) step 1 is probably "What do I need to look for with a VoIP provider in relationship with what I want to do as outlined above?"**

*(this was actually done to simulate a user picking up a phone, dialing numbers, etc. It allowed me to write scripts to do automated regression testing on work's souper seekret phone related box. So I'm perhaps not a total n00b but have zero experience with some aspects of routing SIP calls over the net, providers, etc.)

This is also a good test of the Providers overall service. As a small - Non technical user, how they deal with you when helping you build a solution from scratch is very telling on how they will deal with you if / when it goes wrong.

use the Web Chat... Explain clearly what you are trying to acheive - What features you want, and let them build you a solution and give you a price... Try a few providers - I am in the UK, so i don't know the product stacks currently available on the wider market. Don't be afraid to ask the providers questions - Even if you think it's a stupid question.

If you are looking at something you can build out, maybe look for a 3cx partner - they should be able to supply the Backend lines (SIP) + the Server / Software / Tools you need to get up and running - and manage for you. This may work out a little more expensive though.

Sorry I can't help much more - Maybe someone in your Region can give a more in-depth answer than me?

> Absolutely, harsh reality is no one cares what tech stack we use. Unless your customer/client is a dev themselves and they’re just looking to outsource a heavy backlog. 

It all depends on the specific customer you are trying to service, hence why niching down lends itself to higher quality in more than just the offer. 

You learn specific pain points, typical objections, risks, approachable prices and how to speak their language. The list goes on. This all helps in your messaging and making the sale. 

The only thing guaranteed to move you forward is to test then iterate with feedback and repeat. 

Here’s how our approach has iterated from when we started to right now:

2 years ago: translate your vision into a powerful online presence (websites) 

Now (2024): we provide done for you custom software for SMBs who can’t use ‘off the shelf’ products (apps)

Still needs more niching down but the direction is set by our clients not by us. They ‘show’ us where we can provide the most value and be most competitive in the market. It just comes with a lot more volume so we won’t have the answers with less than 10 clients. The key is to keep improving, keep learning, and keep iterating. 

We’re not meant to have the answers beforehand, we’re meant to work towards it.

> Yeah and soon the newbies realize the truth sets in. That u need to make a lot of mistakes and fail to move forward. Newbies get mad and down vote u for telling the truth. Then they expect you to do free mentoring and or think you're going to tell them this golden goose secret to getting clients and results. Typically the guru sent that newbie. 

I learned and earned my stripes through pain. Newbies don't want to invest in themselves financially, nor take this seriously, nor dedicate time, no execution... just bs tasks to feel busy like making a website?? Or websites smh lol. They bs on a pitch deck. They get a hard on because a guru gave them a few templates. They watch a "free smma course" on YouTube and come here to still ask questions. They are afraid of cold calling. Too broke to run paid traffic. Can't sell, can't close, and can't market. 

My favorite is "I'm a marketing agency but can't get clients" lol. So how were u going to get clients results? From my experience it's easier to get clients than results lol. They ask too many fear based questions that lead to procrastination. 

I joined reddit to drop knowledge and exchange knowledge with like minds to stay sharp. If a newbie asks a real question that I can answer from my experience then I'll answer. 

Yes, OP ur right the newbies should get a job in the industry they want to provide service in. Study the niche inside out. What does the client day look like? What are the client's customer pain points??? A HVAC guy talks differently from a chiropractor....a chiropractor is not going to sell - at least not hard sell. An HVAC guy (most home service guys ) will hard sell for survival...so you're dealing with 2 different animals.

> Yo....  So...

How does ICE know where people work?   Because It's on their I-9 form.   When ICE shows up to an address with a list of names?   Those people are hired on a I-551, I-776, or I-94 form.  They pass E-Verify, and are documented legal employees.   Who under executive order are being subject to extrajudicial revokation of legal status and removed from the United States, or detained, or shipped to El Salvador.   Lots of options there.

The key word here is documented with legal status.  That's why ICE knows where they live and work.  Because the have legal documents.

The undocumented / illeagals are a totally different story.   That being said if you want to wash dishes, dig ditches, work in a slaughter house or do agricultural labor, there's not enough illeagals to fill those jobs and they will take you.  I've met some of the owners.  They take anyone with a pulse same day, and can never find enough people.

Back to subject at hand.  

This is R/consulting.  So if you can't talk the talk why would anyone take you seriously.  

Lovely troll comments.

But when I file a change order or contract claim for $2,000,000 of labor costs due to a site shut down from an ICE Raid on on of my projects that cost us a 2 day delay and a million dollars a day of labor?  And now we have further delays and ICE related litigation. Between Owner, Prime Contractor, 3 dozen subcontractors, internal and external legal counsel, not to mention a dozen consulting firms on different sides of the problem?

Like just sorting out that mess is a full time job for like 6 people for at least a year.  Been there, actually have the t-shirt.   Which is another million dollars or more in service labor costs.

Then say legal action - jeez, now the lawyers cost another million on each side just to explain to the executives and shareholders there's nothing they can do other than accept it, pay for it and move on.

So end result is several million dollars of extra cost in ICE disruption remediation.  Not to mention the weeks of overtime, missed family time, closed door arguments, and meetings.

All because ICE showed up in Masks and Guns, and decided to Revoke the working Visas of a security Gaurd and a Junior electrician that were I-551 or I-776  legal immigrants with Federal Employement Authorisation.   And the wrong tatoos.

So legal counsel is basically telling me the best strategy to deal with ICE is basically to hide them, keep them quiet, and give them whatever they ask for as quickly and quietly as possible, as to save the millions of dollars of problems that happen when masked guys with guns roll up on the security gate.

Seriously.  According to ICE statistics Last year over 200,000 immigrants were peacefully and quietly removed from the United States with Due Process and NOBODY CARED.  The news media didn't care, none of us knew it was happening or didn't worry about it.

Like 2 dudes in suits show up with badges and a warrant; we have a 5 minute chat, call in the p

### r/VOIP — 2025-06-11 | 1pts | Mentions: **Vonage**

> Sorry if this it TLTR.

Perhaps I am confused, but the responses appear to be recommending a softphone on your PC instead of a physical phone on your desk.  I don't see how that saves you any money.  You still have to pay for a phone service provider like Vonage, et al.

To answer your original question, yes, you can run a PHONE SERVER on cheap hardware at home. This is simple enough for someone who has been down that road, but darn tricky the first time through.  Issues:  Selecting which freeware software, 3CX, Asterisk and FreeSwitch are big ones.  Then you still have to have a provider who routes the calls to your server. Most of those providers are far cheaper than typical home service like Vonage and some can support going straight to a soft or hard phone. You may lose features like voice mail, you may not.

If you are a web developer type, check out TWILIO.COM - I am very happy there but I have a webserver to handle the custom routing and setup Voice Mail on.  If not, maybe look at VOIP.MS or 1000 others.  
  
If you try to put a "server" in your home without a statis IP address, you will likely have to update every time it changes. A far worse problem is dealing with NAT (network address translation) to your server behind a typical home router.  (NAT is the thing that allows lots of home devices to all share your ONE external IP address).  SIP (voip protocol) to/from a server that is NAT forwarding can be a nightmare resulting in lots of different problems: one way audio, outgoing calls only, no connection at all, everything works until your router's NAT connection times out, then no more inbound calls, calls drop after 5 or 10 minutes, etc. I had a very very bad time fighting NAT over the years. Granted things are much better now and the problem is not bad if the SERVER is not behind NAT and the phones are.

IMHO, you are better off using your time to make money (part time) or looking for a new job.  PM me with your skill set and location? Also, I have used Mint mobile for 3+ years at $15/month and I am completely satisfied.

> VoIP technology really isn’t meant to be used for someone’s primary number and isn’t inherently associated with privacy. If anything, in the sector or general civilian use, they’re often used for scams and companies don’t let you use them for 2FA or MFA most of the time.

If you’re particularly worried about privacy, just use different phone numbers for work and business than you contact friends, family, and personal contacts with.

A sample setup could be something like:

Number 1.) Friends & Family
Number 2.) Work, Colleagues, Networking, and Business Responsibilities 
Number 3.) Personal Business and MFA like banking and securing your social media profiles

In this scenario, numbers 1 and 2 could be VoIP if you want but honestly a regular number is probably easier.

VoIP is often tailored towards business and corporate use which is what causes a lot of VoIP setups to become pretty complex like those used for office phone systems. However, there’s a thriving personal VoIP business in the US with services like TextNow, TextFree, TextMe, and apps like that.

If you want to get started with personal VoIP, I’d recommend getting a [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) number. It’s a FREE VoIP number you can get from Google using a Google Account that you can use for calls and texts via the Google Voice mobile app or at voice.google.com on a computer. The service is actually designed to give you one phone number that “rings across all of your phones.” So during signup, it’ll ask you to verify a real cellular phone number and you can add more as well. The way it works is that if someone calls your Google Voice number, Google Voice in turn calls all the linked phone numbers (like say your cell phone and landline) so that you can answer on whatever phone you’re close to. You don’t need to use it this way, though. Just link your cell number during setup, then delete it in the account settings and download the Google Voice app on your phone. You’ll get a Google Voice number that you can make and receive calls and texts to/from. On the app, make sure you set calls to use data and not cellular (otherwise the app will make you link your real phone number back when you don’t need to). Each Google Account can have one Google Voice number so you can get a second number by using a second Google Account. The only exception to that rule is if you get a new number from Google Voice and then port a second one in, in which case you can keep both on the same Google Voice account.


Apps like TextFree, TextNow, and TextMe work pretty good too but do have a lot of adverts.


Another route is to just get prepaid phone numbers. If your phone is an iPhone XR / XS or newer, it supports dual SIM so you can have one physical SIM card and one eSIM on your phone, both active at the same time with two different phone numbers. If you have an iPhone 13 or later, you can have two eSIMs active at once (instead of 1 pSIM and 1 eSIM), allowing you two phone numbers that way. The be

> A few thoughts for you:

You may or may not be right that your lack of staffing is caused by your ND disclosure. I’m going to try to frame out why and provide recommendations for you. 

Why they may hesitate to staff someone who is ND:
1) Individual bias
2) Corporate bias - D&I initiatives may be a facade 
3) New hires are always a risk, and they’ve chalked this into an increased risk bucket
4) Consulting is a client service business and some of the challenges of ND folks make it harder to succeed in that set-up
5) They are honestly trying to match you to the best project based on the supports you asked for and it hasn’t come up yet. 

It also just might be that there isn’t enough work. 

Note that these are a mix of bad and good reasons.  For your immediate best path it probably doesn’t matter which is why. Longer term it might - if it’s bias driven you may never be able to change that false impression of lack of capability. 

So what do you do. I would sidestep the issue, unless they force you to address it. I would keep doing great work. I would explicitly ask for project work. I would ask for feedback on the work you are doing. You want to make it clear that staffing you on a project will be a win for that project. If you get answers about project availability, I would acknowledge that and then ask what you can do? Can you help with more client development. Is there anything you can focus on learning to set yourself up for success? Generally give off the vibe of someone who is ready and capable of more. 

In the future, I think you can accomplish almost all of the goals of disclosing your neurodiversity without actually making the disclosure. Frame it as “things that help me work best”.  Many companies use things like Myers Briggs which mostly just facilitate conversations about working styles. So you can come across as just really self aware if you raise certain things. “I tend to get really focused on getting all the details, so I may ask you explicitly how long you want me to work on things.” “I tend to do best with clear plans, is it OK if I take some time to lay this out and make sure I’m not missing anything.”  As you build relationships you can make more pointed disclosures “Hey, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, just so you know I’ve learned my failure mode is to put my head down and try to do everything when I have to much.  If you see me doing that I’d appreciate the heads up, I may need help thinking through prioritization.”  Start small and build up to more “risky” disclosures once you’ve built up a relationship and a well of goodwill.

> I run a company that utilizes the zero-retention policy. It's not a custom contract, but you do need to meet certain requirements. [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data#zero-data-retention](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data#zero-data-retention)

The NY Times suit does not affect ZDR users. From [https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/](https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/) \-  
  
**What if I am a business customer and I have a Zero Data Retention agreement?**

* You are not impacted. If you are a business customer that uses our Zero Data Retention (ZDR) API, we never retain the prompts you send or the answers we return. Because it is not stored, this court order doesn’t affect that data.

Technically there is no reason why an LLM provider cannot maintain data security and privacy. Like any business relationship, it comes down to whether you trust the vendor. We trust OpenAI to maintain data privacy out of their own self-interest. We also utilize other LLM providers, including the some of the cloud providers you mention, to maintain vendor diversification and LLM specialization. 

We are early in this technology cycle, and people fear change. At the same point in the cloud services technology cycle, people argued that giving your data to cloud providers was crazy. But in the long term the lowest cost and highest value services will become the norm. Unless you are a very large firm with very significant risk, it's unlikely that commercializing locally hosted LLMs will be the answer.

> Sorry this happened to you.  Unfortunately this is always a risk when someone shares their ideas while selling a service or interviewing.  You have to have a line in mind that you are not willing to cross when answering questions for free.  In other words, when will you simply walk away.

While signing an agreement (about ownership, not using your ideas etc.) may help, the reality is it costs money to enforce an agreement.  Worse, a court may value your idea for an amount that is less your' attorney's fees which would easily be $25K-$100,000.

I advise vendor clients to strike an agreement for a price that (1) their customer pays a chunk upfront thereafter at regular intervals and for the vendor to agree to a contract period that is shorter than the vendor would like but can live with e.g. 6 months, 9 months whatever etc and perhaps limits the scope of work the vendor originally had in mind (so as to limit potentially costly deliverables). You get the idea. All of this is put in the contract.

 While its less than ideal, the vendor client gets some money, improves the product on a real customer,  receives IP protection in writing (enforceability could still be an issue) and simultaneously seek additional customers. 

Your story is a great reminder to ALL of us about the delicate balance between (1) demonstrating one's competence to get hired and (2) being taken for a ride.

### r/agency — 2025-08-21 | 1pts

> Hi everyone, I’m 18 and currently in 12th grade, but I’ve been building an agency idea around AI voice agents and chatbots for service businesses. I need some blunt, real-world feedback from people who have actually run Global agencies from India and understand client acquisition, retention, and taxes. The service part of my business is mainly automated because once the agent is set up, it doesn't need to give constant efforts, so the business model is more focused on sales only.

Here’s my current model:

We provide AI voice agents and chatbots that handle incoming calls, answer queries, schedule appointments, and capture leads.

Pricing: ₹12,900/month (~$149)+(Additional Credits)for voice agents and ₹8,600/month (~$99)+(Additional Credits) for chatbots.

Client distribution: about 60% choose voice agents, 37% chatbots.

Client churn: expecting ~2 clients lost per month.

I have 6 employees, each paid ₹40,000($458)/month, and each brings in ~4–5 clients monthly.

I’m planning to bring in two Professional sales co-founders, both fully focused on sales + outreach (not technical). I’d keep 50% profits while they take 25% each.

I want to run this while balancing studies, so the co-founders would handle most day-to-day operations.
(And the thing is I'm hiring Professionals, Who have skills in the sales and outreach area)


My questions:

1. Does this business model look sustainable/scalable in the USA/UK market?


2. Are my prices too low or reasonable or high?


3. What should I improve before scaling (processes, pricing, client retention, tax planning, etc.)?


4. With high fixed salaries (₹2.4L/month employees + CA costs), am I taking on too much risk too early?


5. For anyone who has run an agency in India, what are the hidden challenges (clients, taxation, compliance) I should know before going all in?



I’m not looking for sugarcoated replies — I want genuine, practical advice from someone who has actually run an agency in India.

> What is it that makes you feel you need to narrow your focus?

Are you missing deadlines? Product quality diminishing? Leaving money on the table elsewhere?  Or no longer want to do xyz..

Sure, being more focused will probably accelerate some things, but acceleration isn’t always good if it sends you in the wrong direction. 

My experience: We acquired another agency just because one of the sr. partners had a quarterly goal to grow our firm through acquisitions. On paper, made perfect sense. 

He was so strict on hitting his goal, he would not push back his objective date. And fast-tracked our first acquisition. 

So, we bought an agency that wasn’t a great fit. Their client base was used to paying $500 per month and basically getting unlimited web support. 

No one tracked time, no one was really accountable. 

We were very different. 

We bought the company, and immediately started charging those clients our rates. And kept track of which clients cost more. And charged them accordingly. 

Within a year I think we went from acquiring 50 new clients.. to having maybe 10 left. Maybe less. 

The amount of time and energy my team put into learning all these new clients, their campaigns, etc etc.. all in vain really because the clients were never really a good fit. 

I guess my main point here is.. don’t sacrifice your logo term goals for short term gains. 

Is your goal to leave your 9-5?

If so, what revenue  goals do you have to make that leap?

Which product path is more likely to help you reach that mrr goal? Or, pick the product/ service you are most passionate about… and learn how to build the recurring payment model you need

Your 9-5 affords you a lot of freedom to take risks and be creative. I would leverage that to find your answer.

> Not exactly an agency, but a marketing consultancy; "whale hunting" is our deliberate strategy.

We primarily target P&L owners (like business unit leads) since the marketing functions serving their BUs typically don't have a budget for a service like ours, but we do get the odd marketing director or CMO keen to improve their function with us, too.

Our primary strategy is inbound with a mix of content and events, plus we're big on expansion (65+ percent of revenue comes from existing clients and buyers), meaning we don't have too much pressure to go out and hunt.

(Book tip btw.: grab a copy of "Never say sell" by McMakin and Parks if you haven't read it yet!)

Sales cycles and conversion plays can be very long (six months plus is the minimum for us; 24 is not unheard of), negotiations are sometimes complicated (think IP rights negotiations, liability insurance discussions, IT compliance audits, payment and exchange rate nonsense - most large enterprises will make their suppliers 'eat' both, which can be substantial - and other silliness [like your buyers not being aware of their corporate's procurement policies...]). And onboarding can be tricky, like others here have already said.

Add to that that a win is not always the same as work and revenue right away, and you see why this isn't for everyone: The first step for us is often the signing of a "master services agreement," which comes with a hypothetical budget; said budget is then only released when the client accepts a specific project within said MSA (which usually happens, but is not always guaranteed; again: we're not exactly an agency, so your experience might differ). 

But then: these projects tend to be "big ticket,", and the long sales cycle and ramp-up are compensated by very streamlined "downstream" processes. Plus, these guys always pay on time and in full. Oh, and we find client retention and development much easier with the "bigger fish..." 

But this last bit might be subjective.

Overall, I think there's no wrong or right answer when it comes to the "enterprise yes or no" question, but in my experience it's easiest to focus on one segment explicitly (so: enterprise OR SMB), since bizdev is so different between the two... I guess there are folks who can run two very different sales processes and cycles simultaneously - I certainly cannot.

Final thought:

Winning enterprise clients can be significantly more complex and costly than winning SMBs, and often there's more risk (we took a big cash flow hit when lining up a big contract with a Fortune "200" 2 years ago, with significant biz dev cost and prolonged negotiations resulting in a situation where the account ran "in the red" for nine month)... But I do find they're easier to service. 

Oh, and: the fact that they're a bit more difficult to bring in seems to make it so there's less competition for their business? ('s how it feels to me, at least... We rarely pitch, and if we do, we rarely see firms of our size [3.5 FTE] in t

2) Great questions lead to great answers. Ask great questions so others can okay their part. Some value I would expect from you if I were a partner: keeping everyone focused on the core commitments and reminding them of the details. They likely don’t know them as well and leaders tend to think too much in the abstract. Help them understand and think through the connective tissue. What haven’t they considered- risks, challenges, ancillary services? What are competitors likely to offer - what is our clear differentiator? Talent, cost, track record? What haven’t we considered about abc? What if…? All questions/value adds that sound good or lead to good insights. Requires little knowledge.

I’m already (apparently) seen as partner-adjacent (though there has never been formal discussion on it) given that my name is on our corporate letterhead and I’m to have my name displayed on the firm window itself (not sure what liability this exposes me to if this is what’s represented).  Furthermore, given that this lawyer is 80+ years old, he has expressed his intention to have me take over the firm on my own very soon (presumably via a corporate purchase - again liability concerns?).  This means that I would be operating the Real Estate and Wills and Estates sector of the firm on my own as well (despite my desire to practice in these areas I have had minimal exposure and training to take these matters on solo and given that most professional negligence claims arise from real estate practice this does concern me).  Add the fact that I have 25 litigation files on top of this and there would be significant time constraints to learn everything I would need to know.  

Essentially, I am quite concerned that I’ve not received nearly the level of training or basic advisement to operate in the practice of litigation without risking malpractice allegations and professional negligence.  I can already advise that there are matters I have dealt with that could have ended up in such a situation had circumstances broke differently (and the times he does agree to review my work he does not pick up on these mistakes).  

To make matters worse he has grown to dislike the paralegal associated with the firm and no longer wants me using him as a resource or having him connected to the firm in any way going forward (my only remanence of a lifeline).  This has only added further stress.  

I won’t get into much more to spare further rambling but as a 2nd year lawyer I’m not sure what is to be expected?  I’ve seen lawyers on Reddit before saying that the first few years are hell but this is obviously all relative.  It certainly doesn’t help that anything to do with preparation of legal documents and filing now adays are done so via computer software/electronically and this lawyer does not even have his own computer (our receptionist operates his email account, conflict checks, etc. and the clerks use his Teraview key on his behalf to sign such instruments as electronic transfer documents, etc in the real estate sector).  As I’m sure you can guess from not having his own computer this lawyer does not prepare any of his own documents and delegates most of this legal work upon myself (in litigation) and the clerks (in real estate and Wills and Estates)

Any advice would help as to how I should be proceeding in this situation.  I feel this needs to be addressed in due course before getting in too deep.  At the end of the day I’ve never intended on practicing civil litigation and still have no real interest in doing so (even aside from the major anxiety).  Clients are constantly asking me my expectations on their cases and how the court will view this and that,

> Yes we looked into the AWS route but the cost for the retrofit and server was too much to justify the age of the system and it capabilities even after upgrading. 

I would say most features are there on all of them. It’s really the end user experience that is the killer. It can’t be complicated to navigate or use. Some user want to explore the phones to see what it can do. Others want to call…. That’s it. The challenge is how to accommodate both while not risking a complete uproar over changing phone systems. They know we are looking but I’m afraid most don’t understand what is really happening. Regardless of how many times we have stressed it. 

Also, most of these systems are “you get what you get” for example 8x8, we asked if the BLF could be red to signify the user is not available when the status is set to DND. We were basically told the system is a package deal and cannot be customized on a case by case basis. Which I get but it’s odd to turn away a customer for something I would think a lot of people would want to have. No reason to transfer a call if it’s clear that user is not available. But the light is green so the receptionist transfers anyway.

> One thing I'd flag: 3 clients at $5-7k each is solid revenue but risky concentration. One leaves and you're down 30%+ overnight.

Here's the trap. You try to scale by adding retainers. But retainers require delivery. Delivery requires people. People who aren't you deliver worse work. Clients notice. Churn happens. You didn't build a business — you built a staffing problem with your name on it.

The game isn't "how do I do more work" or even "how do I get others to do my work." It's "how do I make the system the thing that delivers value."

What changed for me was stopping thinking about services and starting thinking about installs. A templatized audit framework that takes the same inputs and produces the same outputs at 80% less time. Playbooks that live in a system — not a PDF — that track completion, surface blockers, and keep the client accountable without you being the one doing the work. Dashboards that pull live data and tell the story so you're not burning 5 hours on a monthly deck. AI agents handling the stuff that eats hours but doesn't need your brain — lead follow-up, onboarding sequences, appointment booking. The offer stops being "I'll consult on your growth" and becomes "I'll install this system that does X. $Y/month. Here's what you get." Clear scope, clear value, clear boundaries.

When the system delivers consistent output, you keep your eye on everything without needing more employees. And you make more money. Everything else is just rearranging the furniture.

I ran an agency before this. Shut it down because the operational overhead was killing the margins, even with good clients. That's what taught me the answer isn't hiring more hands to turn the crank — it's building the machine.

> Interesting thread. I’ve worked on tools in this space and this is basically the problem I kept running into. From a client point of view, Google, AI overviews, ChatGPT, Claude all just blur into “search”, and they still expect the same kind of certainty they used to get from rankings. Under the hood it’s way messier.

What I saw was that anything showing up in AI answers still came back to the same boring fundamentals. Good structure, clear intent, actually answering the question. The work didn’t really change, but explaining outcomes did.

Selling this as a separate, guaranteed service always felt risky. Keeping it under SEO and being honest about what you can and can’t measure felt safer.

> Only thing that actually bothers me is how agency role will be completely different in 5 years with AI than it was just last year. Best practices will require bleeding edge awareness of best ways to deliver work. I’m worried we must focus narrowly enough to find the edge. Which means no more full service, it’s too risky.

So already in my mind everything is different and no one has an answer and I’m obsessed with this problem enough that you’d be hard pressed to tell me you could help in some way
