> What /u/moso7777 said - no need to send ALL your calls to an answering service. Just send missed calls first to get a sense of your volume. Lots of good answering services already mentioned in this thread. One thing no one mentioned that's worth looking at when comparing: spam calls, vendor calls, and hang ups. Different services bill these different. [Upfirst](http://upfirst.ai/) is an AI answering services, so significantly less expensive, and it doesn't charge for spam/sales calls or calls under 15 seconds. (These are labeled in the system so you know exactly what you're billed for and what you aren't billed for.) Worth mentioning that we were started by an attorney, too.

> Why wouldn’t you charge more for clients asking more questions? Answering questions takes time, and we bill by the hour. 

Even before Chat GPT was a thing, I had to train many an unsophisticated client in “how to efficiently use my services”, because if you call me 5 times a week to bounce a hair-brained idea off me that you dreamed up in the shower, or to ask the random questions you pondered up over drinks with your Uncle Joe who went through something similar back in the 80s, you can best believe I will bill you for those calls - or you could sit tight, let me do my thing, and we can discuss the issues or documents in an orderly and efficient fashion when we have our schedules appointment next week. 

Chat GPT is just a new variation on the same old problem, and advising clients that micromanaging drives up fees is not just telling them the truth - it’s doing them a kindness.

> Lawyer who owns an IT firm.  Not here looking for business, we only service Chicago.

These are the questions I wish people would ask me.  

1. What is the monthly flat fee amount.
2. What is and is not included.
3. What will you be billed for outside of the normal contract, i.e. office visits, computer setups, and so on.
4. Will they back up your office365 data?
5. What security products will they be using.
6. What is their response times (most lie) but have them write their answer in their contract
7. What software they will be using for remote access
8. How many other law firms do they represent
9. Do they understand your ethical obligations for duty of care and confidentiality
10. ISO27001 speaks to best practices for data security, ask them if they follow it internally and ask them if they will bring you into compliance
11. Ask them how they store your passwords internally.  ITGlue is the industry standard.
12. What is there strategy to help you guard against phishing.  It should include MFA using authenticator, changing your MS 365 sign in logo, flagging external emails, limitations on geographical logins, and a robust malware/phishing scanner that scans prior to the mail hitting your Outlook.  Windows Business Premium is really good at catching phishing.
13. How is any data on your laptop being backed up.

I hope this helps.

> The riches are in the niches - pick one, get good at it.  It will pay the bills. Avoid blowing a fortune on paid ads and SEO. Go with YouTube and Social media marketing. Cheap to do. Get an AI Agent to answer your phones 24/7 and book appointments for you. Train an AI Agent to handle Intake and verify high-value clients. Consider creating virtual offices in neighboring cities to extend your reach. Take advantage of legal document services, etc.

It's easier than ever to build a practice from scratch.

> The short answer is, because the lawyer is typically signing the LOP saying that the client is getting the treatment in exchange for 100% reimbursement of the bills. 

I’m not saying you can’t negotiate off a LOP, but it makes it harder. If you are the lawyer, to negotiate the bills with an LOP, you have to say the case value turned out to be less than you hoped and so the doctor should take less than you promised they would get. I have never litigated one but I could easily see a doctor saying that the LOP is a contract that guarantees full payment and, therefore, it must be paid at 100%. 

Contrast this with a healthcare provider lien. A lien is a statutory right of reimbursement. Those are almost negotiable based on case value regardless of the amount of the lien compared to the settlement. The doc can’t say “you promised,” he/she/they can only say “the law promised.”  

Don’t forget, a US medical provider always has at least two ways to get paid after the services are rendered. First is based on contract.  They have all the remedies that contracts give anyone including collection actions and breach of contract claims. Lien is the second if there is a know PI case. They often don’t like the first because it is time consuming and recovery rates are low. They typically love liens because if the client is represented by a good PI lawyer, the doc is likely going to get paid and paid a lot more. Pushing for liens allows the client to get the treatment needed but does not completely handcuff you as the lawyer. And if the doc does not like the lien-based solution, remind them they can go for a breach of contract case. Suddenly, they like the lien.

> Hey everybody! This is Andy, one of the owners of SMB Team. First, I want to thank everyone for their comments here, including the constructive criticism!

I’d like to address some of the concerns raised in no particular order. Since this will be a longer post, I’d like to invite anyone with additional questions to email me at andy \[at\] smbteam \[dot\] com. I’m more than happy to hop on a call, answer your questions, and provide free marketing tips—no sales pitch, I promise.

First, I’ll be the first to admit that we’re not perfect. We’re a fast-growing company, and like many of the law firms we serve, our goal is always to deliver the best results possible. Sometimes, things don’t go as planned, but when they don’t, Bill (my business partner) and I do everything we can to address the situation quickly and effectively.

Almost all of our clients (nearly 600 law firms) have either my cell phone number or Bill’s, and we pride ourselves on being available. If any issues arise, we always encourage clients to reach out directly, and we’re committed to resolving concerns swiftly. We genuinely care about the outcomes our clients achieve.

I started the company in 2012 at my kitchen table, and Bill and I merged companies in 2022. We’ve since grown to around 130 employees, which comes with its own challenges. As anyone who has built a business knows, growing pains and staff turnover are part of scaling. While we work hard to maintain a strong culture, sometimes team changes are necessary to ensure the best results for our clients.

We’ve had to make tough decisions regarding staffing, but we believe those changes ultimately improve the experience and outcomes for our clients. It’s never easy, but we are constantly learning and improving as we grow.

Regarding some comments about our services being similar to other marketing companies: we offer a broad range of services that go beyond marketing, including fractional CFO, fractional COO, bookkeeping, and intake support. Our approach is holistic, addressing every key area of law firm growth—consistent lead generation, intake systems, building a strong team, and financial planning. This sets us apart because we’re focused on long-term, sustainable growth, not just marketing.

I’m also proud to say that every success story, review, and testimonial we share is 100% real. We’ve never paid anyone to provide a testimonial or fabricated a case study, as that’s both unethical and unnecessary given the results our clients have achieved.

Lastly, I’ve noticed that some comments are from people who haven’t worked with us directly, which tells me we have more work to do in educating the broader legal community. Our goal is to help as many lawyers as possible, whether they choose to work with us or not. That’s why we share so much free content, from over 1,700 YouTube videos to various free and paid events. Whether you hire us or not, I’m committed to helping as many law firm owners as possible grow their firms.

> Actually, PIP might be factoring in here in their attitudes, but there's really only two things that matter to make an argument:

Are you being billed out at market rate for your services and are you/did you hit your billables target set for you by the firm?

If the answer to that compound question is yes, there's absolutely no reason for them to not treat you "normally" in regards to compensation.  


If the answer is not unequivacal on both of those elements, it's up to pure negotiation for you to advocate why it makes sense to give you more money.

> It is extremely rare for an attorney to conduct a call with no prior preparation whatsoever. I don't think I've ever conducted a call without spending at least 15 minutes beforehand refreshing my memory and reviewing notes. That's another reason why you might get billed 45 minutes or an hour for only a 30 minute call. Depending on how complex the issues are, it's not uncommon for attorneys to spend more time preparing for a call than actually conducting the call. Clients expect lawyers to come to a call with answers. It takes preparation to arrive at those answers.

I don't know what the default is if a formal engagement letter has not been signed, but I would expect that a court would treat the situation as one of fairness. You asked the lawyer for a service, she provided it, everyone be reasonable.

> To paraphrase some of your words:

"I’m always happy to talk with you about your case and answer any questions that you might have - in fact I view taking time to talk with clients is part of providing great client service. But please also understand that you are being billed for the time we spend on the phone.  With that in mind, do you want to continue talking now, or think it over and email me some points so we can have a more focused discussion"

Then the ball is in their court, they are informed and can pick the manner of their representation.

> It’s ridiculous. I’m pretty new to this game and am only now learning that judges do not actually care about the law. They do what they want. 

Story time:

Civil matter - foreclosure. Defendant (borrower) did not reply to the petition that was properly served. Default judgement was granted and sheriff sale date was set. One week before the sale, the defendant gets a lawyer. The sale is postponed and a motion to dismiss the judgement is filed based on an allegation of improper/insufficient service. Also included in the filing was 7 pages of straight BS reminding the court that it had the power to grant the dismissal. 

I went to the hearing and factually destroy the service allegations. I told the judge there was no legal basis to grant the motion to dismiss nor was there an equitable basis because the defendant still had every avenue available to redeem the property. Further, I told the judge that granting the motion would set a precedent that people could avoid paying their bills, service, etc. and delay the process simply by finding a lawyer willing to knowingly make up an allegation and file an answer. 

The judge said that she agreed with what I said but she was granting the motion because “they have a lawyer now.”  I asked for the legal or equitable basis for the ruling. She yelled at me and said she will do what she pleases and what she feels is right regardless and the defendant has a lawyer so they should get more time. I argued and asked why my client should continue to go without payment and continue to pay the taxes and insurance while the defendant lives there for free and that treating my client differently just because they are a bank isn’t following the law. She got mad and yelled that I could “take her up and just see what happens.” She knew I wasn’t going to appeal and she let me know that the actual law means absolutely nothing - they do what they want for whatever reason they want. 

So if you get yelled at, just smile and nod and get out of there as quickly as you can, realizing the judge is probably just a power tripping asshat with insecurities who probably hasn’t been laid in months. 

Yes. I’m still pissed off at realizing that the law doesn’t matter.

> I’m curious as to the answers here.  As a solo I generally do not chase clients for money.  I generally require a retainer and I’ll bill a little over it if needed.  If they don’t pay then I stop doing work on their matter.  I may send a follow up email or two.  If they ignore me then I forget them and move on to the next paying client.  I find that it makes little sense to waste my time chasing deadbeat clients.  If they come back needing more services then I will require any outstanding balances to be paid before I assist.

> I took over a practice that had completely died. "400" existing patients, actually turned out to be 15 people... I didn't pay much for it at all... Basically free 

The way I thought about it was that it was a startup with an existing floor plan, outdated equipment that could be turned over as needed, and a few patients to help pay the bills. 

2 years later, starting up this fee for service practice, I wish the practice had a little bit more cash flow to begin with. It's tough.. very tough. 

You can find me me doing hygiene, scheduling appointments, answering phone calls, marketing, sterilization, lab work, radiographs, impressions, clean up, you name it.... Just about everything.

> I'm partly being a wise ass. Partly looking to ruffle some feathers. Because here, you can say things you can't say at like a CE for example.

But, shit.  I've been at this for 20 years.  I started as an associate in PPO.  I called it the crown factory. It was unwritten, but if you wanted to be successful, and there was a pfm that was looking just a little iffy, and it was over the 5y mark, it was not long for this world.  That office didn't balance bill a lot, so it was easy.  We did good work.  But, we did A LOT of it.

Now I work in FFS.  No insurance.  I honestly don't give a shit if I do 1 implant the whole day because my two rooms of hygiene at 350 - 400 bucks a pop (give or take, depending on what they're due for) keeps me doing just fine.

I hardly treatment plan anything.  I never sell.  People have written online that I "actively try not to push extra services on the patients."  We don't.  I have low student loan debt at 1.6%. I own my building.  I literally have no pressure. 

And constantly, I get people come in for a second opinion, coming from a in network place, or worse, a DSO, with 8 cavities tx planned.  I usually find none.  Maybe 1.

I think it sucks, but it's the answer to the op's question.  They want to know when the production comes in.  Well, it comes in when.... you produce.  How do you produce?  You sell, and you drill.  OR, you charge a shit ton for each procedure, and you drill once in a while.

> You're right; if the numbers were ported in (to any carrier, not just GV) and later abandoned/deleted, they would eventually return to the carrier to which they were originally assigned.  If the previous carrier was T-Mobile, and the numbers were originally issued to T-Mobile by NANPA, then they'd go back to T-Mobile, not Google's carrier partner.

But to answer your first/original question, the "housekeeping" around ported numbers can  get sloppy.  The numbers may just sit forever on Google's carrier until/unless T-Mobile somehow requested/took them back. 

Google isn't doing this for any useful purpose or logical reason or malice.  It's just sloppiness.  Since consumer GV users aren't paying for their service, it's harder to keep track when numbers are no longer being used (bills would stop getting paid).

> Okay. I get that what you're saying is The Way It Is; I've had a worm's-eye-view of the process of reactivating and then transferring a 'dead' telco number myself. But one of the nice things about being a fiction writer is that you get to re-write the rules occasionally. So, here's my Final Answer:

* Late February: The telco places a cell tower in service which is supposed to extend coverage for this rural area. They send techs out to verify signal strength, and then to notify customers that wired POTS is being discontinued as of March 31st and "such a deal I have for you!" on wireless voice and Internet.
* The telco's current terms of service require one full month's notification for cancellation by the service provider. But due to inclement winter weather, the techs are a couple days late showing up to the last customer site (my characters' sawmill) and don't deliver the notice until March 3rd.
* My characters pay the March bill on time and in full for service through the end of April.
* The discontinuance of POTS is not just because they're tired of servicing those few rural holdouts, it's because they have a failed switch in a major metro area and customers there are screaming. This switch out in the boonies is the most eligible to be repurposed. So they cut the power and the wires and truck it out of there on its way to Charlotte on April the 15th.
* Since my characters were not given required notice under the ToS and since the bill is paid, the number is not canceled right away. They're able to port their number over before it's officially canceled after the required month's notice.

Yes, I know that I'm overthinking this, but I like to respect my subject matter and my audience, even (especially!) teens/kids. So for those with experience in the field, I know it's a stretch...but if I can get my audience to accept a telekinetic teenager on the run from a psychic Deep State operative while a shapeshifting billionairess plots designs on them both...a screwed up telco shouldn't be too much to swallow...!

> I recently had to do the same thing. There was some confusion about who the resporg actually was. We were paying a bill to AT&T that we thought was for 800 service. AT&T even told us as much. Turns out the resporg was still an old after hours call center we hadn't used in over 2 years. The bill from AT&T was in error, and the old call center had unknowingly been eating the charge for 2 years. Once we figured that out, the process was fairly easy.

Short answer: Find out who the resporg is. That entity and your new carrier need to work together to complete the port.

I'm not sure what ownership you have of a client's phone system, but in a perfect world you could build it all in your own account and bill them back for services? Utilize templates to create users, have troubleshooting visibility, etc.

> Which paid service is the most like the free version of Google Voice?

I migrated off the free version and do not like the paid version of GV at all.  This is for small/remote home offices with 4 users at the moment

Features I came to depend on:

1. Web (and mobile) interface easily showing all calls and texts back to the beginning
2. Simultaneous ring to mobile and desk phones so calls get answered when nobody is at the office
3. Easy transferring among desk phones
4. Good SMS inbound and outbound
5. Voicemail transcription
6. Easy to call outbound from mobile phone anywhere

It looks like [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) might fit the bill but possibly somewhat clunky interface, hard to tell.  Unifi looks interesting, but do they do mobile?  Ooma for business looks interesting but have a poor reputation from what I can tell.

You may need to increase what you bill for those services to hire decent contractors. We own a design firm in addition to our main business and our target market is companies that have finally gotten fed up with the lack of professionalism, consistency and reliability from low dollar box jockeys, sidehustlers and some dude in Bangladesh using Canva or three cents an hour. 

The rates we bill there are still very competitive (post COVID we adjusted to US freelance rates while we deliver pro level work).

> **Processes**

We document our process in Google Docs and save them in Drive. We then have Asana templates for each service we do, and the tasks in the templates tell the assignee to execute specific processes that are linked. It's probably inefficient, but it's highly effective and easy to manage.

**Staff utilization**

We don't bill by the hour and don't calculate utilization to capacity. But I get your point...how do we ensure we give folks enough work but not too much? It's a dance and unscientific at best. It comes down to supervisors paying attention and adjusting as needed or negotiating with the project manager for time. It gets harder with scale because the problem is bigger. 

I hope that answers your questions.

> I am a remote office manager for attorneys like you. (Not trying to solicit business here.) We use [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) to answer calls when I can't get to them and they're pretty good but I do a better job of booking paid consultations because I know the business better. One of the attorneys I work with hired a remote legal secretary before me and fired her because she kept spelling people's names wrong and lost a couple of potential clients over it. If your practice is easy, a remote paralegal could work but if you need someone with excellent customer services skills and/or you want them to take credit cards, I recommend someone who is US based. While I charge significantly more an hour than a remote person, I also bring in more than my client pays me. I'm a source of revenue, not just an expense.

### r/LawFirm — 2025-12-03 | 7pts

> Your approach is 100% the right move for a new PI firm. No one comes out of the gate outranking the massive PI mills for terms like “car accident lawyer.” The smart play is to target long-tail and hyper-local keywords early.

I’d run keyword research through Ahrefs and look for low KD (Keyword Difficulty) phrases like: “motorcycle accident lawyer in {your suburb}, “injured in a Lyft/Uber crash in {city}, “pedestrian accident attorney near {neighborhood}”

These long-tails usually convert better anyway because the search intent is super specific. As your site builds authority, this strategy basically spring-loads your SEO, meaning you’ll jump faster into higher-value keywords later.

While you build those pages, keep stacking the long-game SEO pieces:  
strong location pages  
individual practice-area pages (car, truck, rideshare, wrongful death, etc.)  
FAQ content based on real client questions  
case result pages as you build them (even co-counsel work if allowed)

One huge piece people overlook is Google Business Profile (GBP). For PI, it’s often your #1 lead channel before your website matures. A few things I recommend:

optimize it fully, categories, services, photos, hours, description  
post weekly updates (Google actually rewards activity)  
ask every satisfied client for a review starting day one  
make sure reviewers mention city + type of case naturally (“helped me after my Summerlin rear-end wreck”), that boosts local ranking  
add Q&As and answer them yourself so prospects see helpful info right away

A strong GBP with consistent reviews can put you in the local map pack faster than your website will rank.

(PS: You’ll often start getting calls from GBP surprisingly fast because Google prioritizes “near me” searches based on proximity.)

On the ads side: PI PPC is brutally expensive, but tightly scoped local campaigns can work once your intake systems are dialed in. If calls aren’t being answered live, don’t run ads yet, you’ll burn cash.

And yes, you can absolutely “spring-load” your website for launch. Have your developer prep all pages, URL structure, schema, internal linking, and content ahead of time. When the site goes live, Google sees a complete, optimized structure instead of a bare-bones site, which usually gives a stronger early indexing/ranking boost.

You’re thinking about this more strategically than most solos who open a PI shop, with your experience + financial runway + a solid SEO/GBP plan, you’re in a better position than you probably think.

> Exactly! This is such a real issue — most attorneys I know (including myself) end up spending half the consultation just gathering basic intake details, and only the other half giving actual legal advice.

We struggled with this too. Tried a few answering services like Bellmore and others, but they were pretty expensive and mostly just acted as receptionists — no real understanding of what kind of information we actually needed from clients.

Eventually, we tried Arka AI — it’s more of a virtual assistant that focuses on deeper intake. They worked with us to customize the intake questions to match the ones I usually ask during a first call. They also gave a free two-month trial, so I figured it was worth a shot. It’s been working surprisingly well — I’d say it saves me around 40% of my consultation time now, which makes a big difference since I usually have 2–3 calls a day.

When I started, I focused on networking with other professionals that might work with people needing family law.  So think about who else provides services to your clients and go where they are.

Solo practice is the only way to go!

> What's the angle here? Because honestly, the answer is that there's a lot of reasons that can be individual to that lawyer. 

1.  Many states require or encourage lawyers to take pro-bono cases as a public service by the bar to the public and require some reporting of that as a part of annual licensing.  The American Bar association encourages this.  Some lawyers do generally view it as a community service.    https://www.americanbar.org/groups/probono_public_service/policy/arguments/ 


2.  Depending on the context, lawyers may have particular cases or causes that they care about and choose to take pro-bono. It may be friends and family, political affiliation, or genuine community service.   Doing pro-bono work is also a good networking activity in some context. 

3.  At the end of the day "out of pocket" expenses for any particular case for most lawyers are small, it's just time and effort. Don't get me wrong, if you charge for your time as your profession, your time is valuable.  But a lawyer taking on a pro-bono case with a small time commitment is not the same as  say, requiring a contractor to build a free house (which requires a substantial financial commitment). 

4.  Lawyers, in some cases, particularly in the criminal or family law context, will get stuck by ethics rules on cases where they haven't been paid but cannot withdraw due to prejudice to their clients.  This varies state by state. 

I don't do a lot of "true" pro-bono cases, but I do a lot of community service work. I'm on the board of my local law library, I'm on the board of the local food pantry. For several years I coached the local town high school's mock trial team as a volunteer.   (I also teach at two colleges as an adjunct professor).

> Hire Ruby Receptionist to answer your forwarded line to Ruby. It's well worth the expense. Have Ruby collect pertinent caller info (caller name, case, matter, etc) have her forward your law related calls to you with brief caller intro from Ruby to you (where you either take the call or have her take a message or send to vm; call info then goes to you via text, email or app) & have Ruby thank all sales solicitors for their call, but you are not interested in their service or product & to please take you off you their calling / contact list immediately. Ruby is very good at dealing with sales calls if you instruct them to never put them through. We also have Ruby immediately put through anyone from the Court or their office, our bank that might be calling with a trust account issue, & other VIP callers.

> LSAs (Local Service Ads) can work well if you set them up correctly and manage them. The most important thing is to answer or respond to every lead instantly. 

You must review each lead and provide info. If it is a bad lead, you must dispute it to get a credit back for it. 

Ensure you are stacking your reviews and attach the LSA to that Google Business Profile to benefit from both. 

Google is looking to see you work as the lead, and answering every call and responding to every message is very important.

The minimum spend I recommend is 5k a month. For our smaller attorneys, we often see this work to get a case a month.  

We see 20k per month generate a few cases for a Google Ad campaign. Clicks are expensive and the big players ensure their competitors are not getting the best leads.

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone. 

If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

> I have been using [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) since 2016 when I opened my solo family law practice after several years of firm practice. [Smith.ai](http://Smith.ai) charges by number of calls, not minutes; it doesn't charge for spam/sales calls, answers calls virtually 24/7 (aside from certain holidays); schedules/reschedules appointments, and as mentioned above, integrates with Clio Manage. It also works with Calendly. It offers custom plans and a decent discount for paying yearly up front. Not just an answering service, it does intakes and can filter out unwanted geographic/sub-areas of family law. 

It's not perfect, sometimes inexperienced receptionists get it wrong and you have to be careful with your calling instructions but you can fine-tune that over time. Also if they mess up they will credit the call and call the PC back if you ask. One area where it tends to make mistakes is understanding the geography of my state, which makes sense given that the receptionists are from all over the country. Probably the hardest part of instructions is getting them to understand which counties I accept for some services but not others (e.g. mediation/appeals vs. trial-level work). I don't use their chat service bc it is more expensive than call answering but I imagine it might be helpful for some types of traffic.  Haven't tried the AI-only chat bot option.

> This is something that comes up almost universally in marketing services businesses that are  1-5 years in. It is a dangerous cycle. But it is a cycle. 

That means you can create that cycle or end it. It’s easy to start with one client who isn’t a fit because you have overhead. Then you take another and another until your available billable time is full of shitty clients.

There will always be bread and butter work, clients who are difficult or work that’s not top dollar. That’s normal. The problem is when you get locked in the cycle.

Shedding those clients is hard because now you need every penny to run because shitty clients eat margin. If you keep going with them you’ll ruin your firms reputation.

The answer is setting minimum and ideal client profiles and being willing to say “no” even when your wallet is saying “yes, yes!”.

That is where capitalization comes in. You need a line of credit or a cash cushion to get through the slow times. 

Then it‘s possible to cut clients who are not a fit (you’ll be doing them a favor) one at a time as you replace them with better clients at full rates.

I still get tempted to help out somebody at my expense I often say no because my time is better spent seeking out those better clients than working to keep the lights on with cheap, pain in the ass clients. 

Sometimes a client starts out looking like a fit and then becomes toxic. We fire them. Many firms cut the bottom 10% every year.

Source: this is a big topic of discussion in an online community of agency founders. As an advisor for agencies I have lived it in my company (more than once) and seen it regularly with clients. It’s just too damn easy to fall off the horse. 

But you can do it with grit, a clear target and money.

> There are a few elements my agency friends work on. This is a grab bag of advice. 

1. Start putting x% of every dollar you earn into an owners equity account before expenses. If you plan for profit from the start you will actually build a business. 

2. Write out and automate all your operating procedures. If you do it twice start writing. If you do it three times it’d better be perfect. 

3. Look at your SOPs you’ve been building. What are you doing more often? Those are your best services to sell. 

4. Simplify your offering to one sentence your clients can repeat to another colleague at a networking event when they are complaining about their own business problems. This will be very concrete and specific. Senders.co is my favourite example. Went from a cold outreach agency to focusing only on email deliverability. Clients could then have this conversation, “hey my emails keep going to spam. How do you set up your email outreach?” “Well I got a friend who solves all my email deliverability. I’ll introduce you.”  You need to be someone’s “I got a friend…” answer. 

5. You need to focus on building pipeline enough that you can turn away at least 30% of clients in an up market. In a down market this will give you a buffer. 

5.1. Client acquisition comes from having a simple problem solution position as I mentioned
5.2 Write out your expertise in detail
5.3 Speak at events
5.4 Invite your prospects to workshops to help them solve a small part of their problems. 
5.5 Find a larger partner who can downstream partners to you like a big software company or another large agency; use their marketing channel to push your thought leadership and workshops. 
5.6. Network network network. Find out where your clients are going and go there too. Use your clients to introduce you or give you a favorable review live during the networking event. 
5.7. Ask every client for a referral.

6. Keep your old book of business engaged. Old clients are future clients. You should be recovering at least 10% of old clients. I’d aim for 25%. 

7. Track time. Optimize. Automate. Cut. 

8. Learn how to find other problems your clients have and then offer to solve them. Don’t just sell what team members you have on your bench. Learn to continuously find problems you can serve. 

9. Be resourceful on staffing. Meet other agencies you can subcontract to. Us Upwork or a specialist like InCommon. Fake it until you make it. Whatever. 

10. Keep your existing team training. Cycle in training time.

11. Increase your rates.

12. Business development is more important than fulfillment. You can always find someone to fulfil. You can’t always find clients.

That’s just a braindump from the Agency Cocktails club I ran. It’s not necessarily applicable to you, but maybe something in there clicks. The most important is actually the first point. Plan to be profitable or you’ll never be profitable.

> Congrats on being good at cold emailing! Lots of folks find the vast scale of it draining, so kudos for lasting through that initial stress.

The key to a good "productized email marketing service" is going to be differentiating yourself from what's out there. Just a quick search on Reddit, Google, or TikTok is gonna bring up like 50 hustle bros that say they're already the best at what you're trying to sell.

Saw you listed services in one of the other comments. Here's my thoughts:

*  You said "Email Campaigns: Up to 10 per month"
   * That's a good baseline package. I recommend if you're trying to sell different services, come up with a few tiers that people can choose from. If you're looking to sell 10, then offer, 5, 10, 25, and 100. Most folks aren't going to want to take the cheapest or the most expensive, and they'll typically take 10. If they take 5, try to upsell them after a few months. If they take 25 or 100, pop some champagne.
* You said "Subject Line Creation, Copy Editing, A/B Testing: Testing of subject lines and content"
   * All that's pretty standard/expected, and can mostly be done by ChatGPT at this point. I think it's best to just say they're included and move on. You're not going to differentiate yourself with any of these. 
* You Said "Analytics: Advanced reporting with engagement analysis"
   * Make sure you have some examples ready for clients to review, since everyone says they have analytics. Good reporting can separate you from the rest.
* You said "Support: Priority email support with a 24-hour response time"
   * That's a major selling point. Customer service can be make or break, so I would think about offering something beyond even email support, like your cell phone or WhatsApp.

Anyway, I know it's been a few months since you actually posted, so hopefully you've made some progress! Our agency sells similar campaigns, but there's endless emails to sell so happy to answer some questions even for our competition :)

> I didn’t downvote, I was asleep as another poster implied. 
Yeah - read it recently. 

I know people that worked on a few of the projects in this book (ie healthcare.gov is the big one) and what they’ve had to say flies in the face of what she describes. 

So her main issue that I sorta agree with is with public sector consultants that take the place of org continuity, but that’s entirely an organization’s decision to cede that function to external entities. 

Public sector consulting has this problem with doing a lot of actual work for the organization for them, and you often wonder what the actual client does themselves. I’ve only done a few public sector projects myself back in my consulting days so I can’t really answer that in-depth- she may have a valid point there.

But here is where I lose faith in what she has to say:
Everything else in here is an… insincere interpretation, to put it lightly. 

For context; I was a consultant at a tier 2 for many years and when I was a junior I too thought the work was superfluous. It’s easy to see someone with limited perspective agreeing with her, I would have too.

Now I’m in industry, on the client side, and I hire consultancies (boutique, MBB, etc) regularly to tackle extreme problems, socialize and elevate issues, and save my org a ton of time. 

That is why organizations hire consultants. Expensive? Yes. Can we do it ourselves? Yes.
But we save 6-8 months for hiring a 2-3 week engagement.
To come out and say that’s not a genuine service for any org is ridiculous.

> Look, I’ll give you an honest answer but hoping you’re not an AH just trying to mess with your coworker. 

I’m from and currently live in Mexico. Let’s talk about the weather first, depending on the neighborhood (yes, that specific) your teammate could have super heavy rain or just a drizzle, even if the weather just says raining. If there are thunderstorms then thing will get more complicated. Now, also take into consideration that some states are having mayor heatwaves so that is affecting the power towers hence any service that relies on electricity to operate, in case you hear this next, it is true. If your are sus a quick google search for the weather can clarify this, heat above 100 \~ 105 F or heavy rain stated in the report then you know its a possibility, if it’s says sunny all week then…

Now regarding the internet, it depends on the zone (state + however the internet provider has divided the comercial areas) and the internet provider how it will be affected by the rain. For example, if your teammate lives in a new neighborhood, even if it’s in a big city like CDMX, Guadalajara or Monterrey, they’ll probably be more susceptible to failures as well if they live in an established area in a small town. Also, light rain makes drivers bold so there are a lot more accidents and if someone crashes and hits a tower, it will affect the service for the whole zone.

Connecting into their phone can get really expensive depending on the internet plan they have,  so I suggest avoid making this request unless their phone is business expense (meaning their employer is paying for it).  

Hope it helps!

> Maximumlawyer: I'm not a regular listener, but I was thinking through intake processes and those episodes were pretty good.

[Smith.ai](https://Smith.ai): You have to keep your instructions and process simple enough that anyone can follow instructions. This is because any one of their employees might answer the phone, and they'll be looking at your instructions on a screen when they do so. 

They will schedule on a calendar of your choice, or integrate with Clio for intake. They ask your questions and note the answers. For an upcharge they'll do more stuff as well. But Smith is not like having an employee, instead it's like hiring a friendly robot to answer the phone . . . don't make the robot's tasks too difficult or it will get messed up!

I've instructed them that there's three types of calls: (1) new client, check for practice area, ask a couple of qualifying questions, and schedule for a consult. They schedule on my Acuity calendar that records the answers to questions and puts the consult on my calendar (2) Existing client: offer to schedule a time to talk, or take a message and the attorney will get back to you, (3) Calls from Court, Attorneys, court or law firm staff: transfer the live call to me.

So far smith is good for me, but I only get 30-50 calls per month. If you start marketing and getting lots of calls (common for a growing PI firm) you might prefer to have employees or specialized answering service that does more for you.

### r/VOIP — 2025-07-03 | 1pts

> I find your reply interesting. As a NE, you should know that bandwidth is a very minor concern for VOIP. The bigger concern is Latency and Jitter. I have Voip running on25/25 fiber with 0 issues and running on 1Gbps/50Mbps cable with call quality and drop issues all the time.   


One of the often overlooked aspects of Voip is QoS. If your router/security appliance supports it, this will have a significantly greater net effect on call quality then having a 10Gbps bandwidth that has lots of jitter/latency

  
From GPT (I know the answer, just used GPT for structure of my post)

✅ **Bandwidth is rarely the bottleneck anymore**  
VoIP requires very little bandwidth per call (usually **64-100 kbps per call** even with uncompressed codecs; compressed codecs like G.729 or Opus can use as little as **8-24 kbps**). Most modern broadband or even cellular networks have orders of magnitude more bandwidth than VoIP needs.

⚠️ **Latency, jitter, and packet loss are the real concerns**

* **Latency**: Delay above \~150ms starts to feel awkward in conversations.
* **Jitter**: Variation in packet arrival times causes choppy or robotic sound unless the jitter buffer compensates.
* **Packet Loss**: Even 1-2% packet loss can severely impact call quality.

So:

* Bandwidth *does matter* if you’re on a congested network (e.g., oversaturated home Wi-Fi during Netflix + gaming).
* But for a properly designed business or even home network, **latency, jitter, and QoS (quality of service)** are the **real performance killers** for VoIP.

As someone who has deployed and manage dozens of Voip systems over the yeas, this is accurate.

### r/consulting — 2025-05-06 | 37pts

> A consultant has 2 competing problems:

1. Nobody wants to hire an "expert" that knows less than them. As knowledge becomes more affordable and attainable in-house, the standard for what a consultant has to be gets raised. This is happening across all fields touched by AI, and consulting is not exempt. There will be more demands on experience, degrees, prestige and field alignment. Coming to an end are the days of promising to send in a SME, and some kid with 0 field experience shows up to try to BS some strategy slides in a few days.

2. The dunning-krueger threshold is also being lifted. People that barely understand a topic can have a discussion with an AI that sounds versed, and make the mistake of thinking this equates to having good in-house knowledge. People without skills can't assess skills, so they are stuck thinking that mediocre is good, and won't be able to tell the difference between 5/10 strategy from a bot or the usual 7/10 strategy that come out of consulting. This causes a crisis of communication, in which real SMEs have to work harder to help the lower end of the curve understand that they are screwing up by listening to a low-competence bot. Historically, this is a losing battle, as in the previous iteration, the consulting industry did the same thing by claiming to be the SMEs, to cut out the real SMEs and convince clients to give them the money instead. Now the bots are going to do that to consultants.

The answer is that the world is a competition, and now the robots have raised the standard. Consultants that want to survive need to get better. Deliver better quality, and communicate more effectively about the difference in quality against the robot. Focus on domains where AI is weakest, and also present a hybrid approach in which AI advancements are integrating into the consulting service yet guided by expert hands.

What is your drop rate and SOA rate? 

I work as an AI engineer at a decent size PI law firm and I often look at those stats alongside the ones you mentioned. I solved the issue you stated above by just having a receptionist and intake team separate and available at all times, which is similar advice to what you have received above. I recommend a BPO with strong American accents though...

But a lot of big law firms also struggle with SOAs and catching them in advanced before it's too late.. so for your current clients, what are their stats? Are they getting every call answered? Do you have any attrition that happens in the later stages or not really? At your size I'm curious to if you have those issues or not..

> This is why I say I work remotely at home and only have office hours by appointment only. Sometimes I’m actually working at my office. But no one can just walk in or drop in. It’s an executive suite with a keypad that people need to know the password to get in. No one knows my password except for me and my husband (who sometimes acts like my assistant).   I have had people call and say they’re at my office and they need to drop off paperwork for me to look at etc and they aren’t even clients - I’ve never even heard of them before. I dealt with this problem but hiring a text service that responds to customer inquiries from my website or text with an invitation to schedule a paid consult. I also want to hire some kind of remote or virtual receptionist to answer phone calls but I don’t have this yet. I usually just text them after they leave a voicemail and tell them all potential client inquiries are handled via text. Then when they text me back my text service takes it from there.   I have 4 kids and 7 pets and a lot of hobbies. I take weightlifting classes and teach Zumba classes for my physical and mental health. I also have plenty of clients I’m working for already. I’m not giving up more than two minutes of my time to anyone else for free. It takes me two minutes to text potential clients who call and tell them to text instead. If they don’t want to follow my system and book a paid consult via text then I don’t want to have to talk to them and I certainly don’t want to have to see them at my office in person!

> I'm not a practice owner to be fair, but I can offer some insight into some of the top uses for AI so far in dental.

From what I've seen, AI is best for complementing your staff, not 100% automation. Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.

Any sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.

Another hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.

If anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.

AI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.

> > Can each phone have its own extension number for direct dialing? I assume that if one person is talking to a customer that has called in, another customer is still able to call the dial-in number and talk to someone else.

For sure, either direct phone numbers or extension numbers are very possible.  The answer to this question is somewhat provider-specific, but technically, inbound call routing can be configued any way you like.

> Other than the physical VOIP-capable phones, what do we need to support this?

A PoE (power over ethernet) switch would be helpful.  Every VoIP phone worth considering can be powered by PoE, so you only need to run one cable to your phone.  If you want your service to withstand brief power outages, you can place your fibre equipment and PoE switch on a UPS.

> Finally, we may need a physical fax machine; it sounds like that can be handled by a separate line and an ATA, is that correct?

If a physical fax machine is a critical requirement, make sure the service you choose supports two things: ECM (error correction) and T.38 (the fax standard).  Without these two things, you will surely notice performance issues.  Alternately, use an email-to-fax / fax-to-email service, forget the hardware, and save some paper.

Lastly, be prepared to replace your router.  The vast majority will work well with VoIP, so try it with what you have first, but there's the odd one that will flatly refuse.

Good luck with the project.  Let us know how it goes and if you have any more questions.

> Office At Hand has been unbearable. The app has so many glitches, calls drop suddenly on a daily basis. I've spent hours and hours just trying to get basic answers to questions. But their people don't have the answers and my calls to customer service get disconnected routinely. We were  locked into an expensive 3 year contract but were finally able to switch our numbers to our AT&T mobility account. But after the port the number only worked for a few days and then stopped. Turns out Office at Hand never completed the port (because the entire division is wildly incompetent). The account has already been closed and it seems like our phone line is lost to us. I have an account rep trying to help me with this, but I know it will take many hours to get this fixed--if it is even possible. This product has caused me to reconsider doing any business with AT&T in other areas. It is shameful what they are selling to people.

> what ra121212 said is correct. We haven't even registered these with ring central so they are working off the customer list they purchased in the deal with mitel, Most or all of these are our on-prem customers since before we brought them to Mitel.  What we are finding is we have to Register them because ring central is getting deceptive and striking fear to our customers in their emails. saying they should switch over or they may lose their service.

I wouldn't be surprised if eventually they get an email that says "Just check this box to upgrade your service"  and the customer checks it thinking its an upgrade like on a computer or Iphone.  the customer unknowingly gets us cut out of commission and sours the great relationship we've had for years.  

we were once contacted by a friend of one of our customers that was in a night mare switching to ring central and he told us suddenly his current vendor wont answer his calls. after speaking with him we realized that is exactly what happened. he was contacted directly by ring central reps,  he unknowingly got his vendor cut out of the deal.  they were pissed so they told him to f-off.  He said ring central was relentless.  He requested ring list us as his vendor and we should receive the commission and they refused. so now he's stuck calling the Philippines for help.

> Since all your numbers have been ported to the new carrier, and you're most likely in a 2 or 3 year contract as well with the new carrier, you're going to have to buckle down and make this work; unless you're willing to pay the penalty fee to break the contract.  And I hate to say this, but since you were the one pushing for this change, I'm sure upper management is looking for you to fix it as well.  I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.

- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.

- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into production.

- Now that you have the phone make/model that you want to use, you will need to get the SIP registration information from your carrier and configure each phone with those settings.  You will need to get this information from tech support (unless they have some FAQ online that has this information).  Typically, if you had ordered the phones through your carrier, the phones would have been pre-configured and registered to your cloud PBX.  It would have been plug and play as the installation tech communicated to you.  Since you told your sales rep that you wanted to use your own phones, you will need to configure your phones with the correct SIP registration settings.  Those SIP settings would be the username, password, SIP Server address, SIP registration port, backup SIP server if applicable, proxy server and port if applicable.  Most VoIP carriers will push their own configs to the phones once it has successfully registered with the PBX, but the important thing is to get your phones provisioned and registered to the cloud PBX.

- In the admin portal you will need to create your users, build your extensions, assign your users to the devices/phones, create your ring group(s), create your auto attendant, and route calls to your phone numbers accordingly.  Your carrier should have "how to" guides on how to accomplish this.

- Since you are up shits creek with no service because you don't have any phones working, you should check with tech support to see if there is a sof

> I may have made an assumption. Allow me to attempt to unwind my assumption.


> Houston servers are down since (at least) yesterday. 


I took this at face value. If their Houston servers are down, they should automatically redirect your service to a working POP without you having to change your settings. Unless you're in a scenario I describe, where it's known to not work well.


IF, and only if, their Houston servers are offline... POP failover would ensure that when your phone or PBX registers, it will be redirected to a working server.


To verify that, I went to their status page at status.voip.ms and found an incident. https://status.voip.ms/clyg10kxv126823h2ohwkx43hfv


It states


> Our Houston 1 & 2 servers are currently unreachable. Our team has engaged the data center to learn more about this issue and we will post updates as they come. In the meantime, we have routed all the traffic to a back-up server.


Confirmed.


Now, that means that the amount of downtime should be limited to your registration timer. Commonly somewhere between 60 and 300 seconds. So if it's been over 5 minutes and it's still not working, something's broke.


Now so far, we've made no mention of a second trunk to voip.ms as that wouldn't solve the root problem. The root problem is that the server redirection is not working, per their incident page's:


> In the meantime, we have routed all the traffic to a back-up server.


If you are using fairly default settings, such as connecting to Houston over UDP on port 5060, then it should be working. If it's not, you should open a ticket with support and they should be able to sort you out.


To better answer an earlier question you asked now:


> How do you deal with customer, stress and everything, if you set up a line like that at a busy restaurant? And they don't have a phone for a couple of days... 


I'm a sysadmin by trade but in the same spot... after I've become aware that Houston is flaking, I'd change POPs to New York. The phones and PBXes for my managed customers would all be set up such that I could remotely, and securely, manage the settings so long as the customer permits it. Then I'd go back to sleep once it's switched and working.

> The problem is that most of these systems block/label calls based on the phone number. Phone numbers are not an "identity" and are easily tossed out, switched around, faked, etc. In VoIP it's very easy to just transmit a different number. While STIR/SHAKEN aims to help make this harder to do illegitimately, there are plenty of reasons why it simply can't eliminate all call "spoofing". Keep in mind, there are a lot completely legitimate business cases for spoofing. For example, your kid's school broadcast calling everyone to tell them about a late start due to bad weather. In this example, a broadcasting service would likely transmit the number of the school so you would recognize it. 

Unfortunately the world is focused on phone numbers. Blocking number, labeling numbers, and assigning blame to this problem at the phone number. But the phone number is an ephemerial resource that is meaningless. 

Scammers are really good at manipulating identity. That's how they get people to answer the phone. They do this with phone numbers. We need to introduce ways to transmit IDENTITY on phone calls. You don't care about their phone number, you care about who they are. You'd do the same thing if someone was knocking at your door. Would you ask them for their address, or their ID? 

There are companies focused on this problem, I work for one of them. But it ultimately takes the cooperation of an entire industry to make meaningful change. Not everyone is motivated to solve the problem.

> VOIP set up to mitigate postpartum gender bias :D 

Hi all, first thank you from this noob for any and all help!

What I'm trying to do:

Set up a system in which my partner and I can put down 1 phone number for all admin related to the baby on the way (Dr's office, nursery, immigration office, baby groups etc) which will divert to either of our phone numbers, based on who is 'lead parent' for a chosen time period. For example, we're planning on doing shared parental leave, and then switching back and forth for who is on sick/nursery emergency duty so our careers are more evenly impacted. 

An added bonus would be to be able to divert calls to one of our phones based on who is calling. For example, say all calls from the immigration office divert to me if I'm lead on that, but all call from 'water babies class' divert to my partner bc they're lead on that, etc. 

I've looked at a few VOIP services but am not sure if the above features are covered- it seems that many will divert to 1 additional phone number and you can change that phone number if you wish. This could work for our 'lead parent switch' plan, but feels clunky to me. But, if the lead parent can't answer, it would be important for the other parent to then be called. 

Arw these things that VOIP can do generally? Is this the right route to go? Thank you for any insight! 

_________
Just some context in case interested:
Based on our research and experience so far,  this would massively help combat the structural gender bias in babycare. For example, the NHS (we're in the UK) doesn't even have space for 2 phone numbers in their system and really get tetchy if you suggest not putting in the mother's number...thereby ensuring that all baby medical appt arranging falls on the mother, as well as the task of relaying that knowledge to the other parent. Or, for systems that do have 2 numbers, we've heard from a number of friends that even if the mom's number is listed as 'emergency' she'll get called first, and usually only, from the nursery, etc, even if a note has been put in that the dad is on pat leave and she's working/out of town. 

So this tool is an effort to recognise the reality of gender bias in babycare systems and just sidestep them by staying 1 step ahead of ppl's choices to enact that bias :D

> I'm more proficient with VoIP than I am with traditional telco service, but with your standard handset, whether digital or analog, there's a timer value for your hook switch that will tell the central office phone switch if the line is on-hook (usually anything over 0.9s I think) or if it's signaling for a new dial-tone (i.e. 3-way call or answering a second call).

Based on the description of your problem, it would seem there could be a wiring issue, or possibly a voltage issue since when you depress the hook switch there is voltage that will pass to signal the voice switch to either hang up or switch over for a new line.

If the line has been there for 30 years, without any hardware update/replacement in the last 15 years (such as a media gateway, eMTA/eDVA, etc), you likely have a standard telco NID/NIU that is providing service. If you have a telco butt-set, you can connect the tip and ring to the terminals of that NID/NIU, check for dial-tone, make a call to your cell phone, hang up, and see if the call disconnects on your cell phone. If it does not, you need to call the telco provider to investigate.

> While it is possible in certain cases, the short answer is no. The specific standards still call for A-LAW compatibility when peering. There are no plans to change this at present I believe.

The higher level offerings you speak of (AMR-WB, G722) are not currently offered or planned on a peer to peer basis in the strict sense. The mobile operators offer some AMR-WB compatibility between each other, but it's either internal only or by private agreement between operators which means you will get AMR-WB if you call a Vodafone number from a T-Mobile number, but not if you call a Three number.

The same stands mostly true for those offering G722. BT digital voice will offer G722 but you have to remember that is BT's digital replacement for the PSTN. Even if it's internal only, it's going to cover a VAST number of users.

The best way to find out is to ask your VOIP provider of choice. It would be folly to choose an operator based solely on whether they are going to offer wideband codecs, so pick the one that gives you the best service, price, features, etc. If wideband codec between peers becomes a thing, they will offer it as an almost certainty.

On a side note, I asked this question of Gamma communications when they contacted me about the PSTN switch off and the rep I spoke to said he believed there was some low scale testing going on at the moment but he couldn't expand on what that meant.

> The easy way to do this would be to set up the SIP ATA and the Yealink phones as part of a ring group, either in your on-site PBX if you have one or at the VoIP provider's end.  The idea of a ring group is that all phone and ATA's in the ring group will ring until one of them answers the call, and then they will all stop ringing.  In this case the ATA will never answer the call (because you won't connect a phone to it) but it should be able to run the external ringer.  The ATA can even be part of more than one ring group so if you have more than one line coming it, it can ring when any of those lines ring. Note that **if you are using the ATA to feed an old-style mechanical ringer** from back in the "Bell System" days you will need to check the ATA's ringing frequency setting, because by default many use 25 Hz which will cause those old style ringers to either ring weakly or not at all.  In most cases you will need to change the ATA's ringing frequency to 20 Hz (if the ringer is an Automatic Electric device from GTE then all bets are off, they used all sorts of ringing frequencies from 16 Hz up to 66 Hz and the ringer may be tuned to one of them, and that frequency will be stamped on the ringer somewhere.  But the Bell System almost always used 20 Hz ringing frequency exclusively).  If the ringer is a modern type with an electronic tone then the ringing frequency is *probably* not a concern, most of those will be quite happy with 25 **or** 20 Hz.

The trick will be setting it up, and that will depend on whether you have your own on-site phone switch (and if so, whether any of your employees know how to make configuration changes) or whether you are simply getting VoIP service from an outside vendor (and in that case, whether you have to go through that vendor to make configuration changes or have some way to do that yourselves, such as a web-based interface).  Just buying and hooking up an ATA won't do anything unless it is configured to talk to the switch that provides service to all your phones.  VoIP devices are not like older phone equipment where you can just tap into the right pair of wires and hook up your ringer.

This is also true with some other solutions proposed in this thread.  There is no device you can buy that is going to "just work" without configuration of both the device and the switch (local PBX or external) that provides service to your phones.  And if you have no idea how to do that configuration, you'd probably best figure out who does before you start buying equipment.

> Thank you very much for these suggestions, I am going to start researching them!

Static IP - yes, of course I have one, I wouldn't even think about running a PSTN-interconnected cellular network without having my MSC (Mobile services Switching Center, a GSM architecture term) at a static and public IP address. IPv4 only currently, but if I need IPv6, it should be easy to add.

But seeing your reference to LCR, "standard" and "prime" routes (yes, I realize I still got some learning to do), I realize that I omitted one key detail from my question - quality. I do **not** use any compressed voice codecs like G.729, instead I only use G.711 PCMU and PCMA. When I receive incoming calls at my current BulkVS numbers, I get a SIP INVITE message, and the included SDP offers PCMU, PCMA and G729 - I am referring to the offer/answer model of SDP, as in RFC 3264. My inbound call gateway (I wrote my own SIP software) always responds with an answer that accepts either PCMU or PCMA, whichever is offered, but never accepts G729 or any other non-G.711 codec. My outbound gateway (another piece of SIP software written by me) always sends out INVITEs with SDP offering only PCMU and PCMA, no others.

When it comes to outbound international routes, I am looking for some that won't butcher my G.711 calls by passing them through some compressed voice codec internally. Assume that the destination country I am calling has its own legacy PSTN that runs on G.711 64 kbps channels internally - I want a clear-channel 64 kbps path from my outbound gateway to the destination country's legacy G.711 PSTN, without any hidden/surreptitious transcoding being done covertly by a "cheap" route. Why do I insist on such a transparent G.711 64 kbps channel? One of the reasons I seek such a thing is because I wish to implement 3GPP TS 28.062 in-band TFO (tandem-free operation) for GSM to GSM calls, which is only possible with a clear 64 kbps G.711 channel that no one is mucking with along the way.

Any idea which provider(s) I should focus on if I am looking for someone who will pass my G.711 64kbps voice channel through transparently to the destination country, rather than pass through some compressed codec?

> Hey u/First-Ad4474   
  
Totally get where you're coming from. Scaling a consultancy is tough, especially because it’s such a personal service. Clients aren't interested in generic advice, they want to feel like you understand their specific challenges and can offer tailored, expert input (not something they could easily get themselves from ChatGPT).    
  
From what you’re saying, it sounds like you’re looking for a way to scale your expertise without losing that personal touch, which is definitely doable. One way some people go about it, is by piecing together a DIY setup: sending out a questionnaire (like what you'd ask during a first discovery call), scoring the responses in a spreadsheet, and then generating a PDF with some feedback based on that score. You can put this together with tools like Google Forms, Sheets, maybe even Zapier or Make. But this can get messy fast, especially when you're juggling multiple clients or want things to look polished and on-brand.  
  
That’s actually why a lot of consultants end up switching to an all-in-one tool like Pointerpro (full disclosure: I work there). Our tool lets you build your own assessments and automatically generate personalized PDF reports based on the answers people gave. Super handy for qualifying leads, doing intake, or even running more in-depth audits, without having to build everything from scratch every time.  
  
Happy to share more if you're curious, but no pressure at all. Just wanted to throw it out there as something that might save you time and make your process smoother.

Cheers,

> TL;DR: I recently transitioned from a three-year career in auditing to management consulting, specifically focusing on Finance Transformation at an international consulting firm in a non-English speaking country. I'm feeling somewhat lost about the nature of my new role and the day-to-day tasks. I'm seeking advice since I just started this week and haven't been assigned to a project yet.  
  
Hello everyone! I'm reaching out for guidance regarding my new career in Management Consulting. I'm thrilled to have joined an international consulting firm in a non-English speaking country this week. However, I have numerous questions that I can't seem to find answers to.  
  
Here's my background: I spent the past three years working at an audit firm. My clients primarily consisted of medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their business activities. During this time, I progressed from a junior auditor to a senior auditor and gained valuable experience.  
  
Over time, though, I found the audit work becoming somewhat repetitive, and with the busy season approaching, I decided to leave this summer. Rather than switching to another auditing firm, I wanted to venture into something new. So, I applied to several management consulting firms and was accepted by one after completing the interview rounds.  
  
Throughout the interviews, I could articulate my reasons for shifting from auditing to consulting and explain what I could bring to the consulting field. However, I struggled to grasp the day-to-day responsibilities of a management consultant. It all seemed quite nebulous, with people using buzzwords (mixing a lot of english words with local language and using a lot of acronyms) when I asked for concrete details about their work. Most responses to my questions about tasks and responsibilities boiled down to "it depends".  
  
Despite the uncertainty, I chose to pursue a career in management consulting to gain a better understanding of what a consultant does, and work for MNCs. I'm currently working in a practice that offers Finance Transformation services. I've just started this week, and I haven't been assigned to a project yet (though it's likely to happen next week).  
  
  
My primary goal is to understand what will be expected of me, the deliverables I'll be responsible for, and the day-to-day routine of a management consultant. Additionally, I'd like to know which skills will be the most valuable as I'm eager to grow in this role.

So if you can provide any help or advice, feel free to reply here or contact me directly. 

&#x200B;

Have a great day !

There are some nuances to which you should pick (we’re a good fit for 5-80 person firms, PointOne tends to do better for large firms, Billables is cheaper but slightly lower quality, but still has a solid fan base). Happy to answer any Qs

> Yes, this happens to every solo who answers their own phone because you are the buyer and you are reachable, so you become a quota target. Blocking does not solve it because they just rotate numbers and sometimes it is literally the same rep pretending it is not. The only thing that works is making the phone stop being a free front door. Unknown numbers go to voicemail and you only call back when the message sounds like a real client with a real legal problem. If you want to keep speed for new matters, use screening like YouMail or a simple answering layer so clients get through and sales gets parked in a message you can ignore. When a vendor does get you live, do not debate, just say please remove me from your list and hang up, because every extra sentence teaches them that pushing works. What matters more for you, never missing a potential new client call, or getting your day back from constant interruptions?

> Lawyer who does IT for firms.  

Have your IT department or provider fill out the technical parts of your application.  Don't fudge your answers as it will be held against you if you are breached.


By default your IT provider should be doing the following for you.  

1) Make sure to have MFA on all accounts, avoid using SMS and use the authenticator app if possible

2) If you are using office365 you need a separate backup for Mail and SharePoint data.  SkyKick is a good option.  Your IT provider should be providing this, BUT you should confirm. With Skykick, you can restore mailboxes and calendars in hours after things are encrypted.  Don't sleep on your office365 backup.  


3) Make sure to have what is called an IDR solution.  This is just a detection, prevention, and remediation tool.  You can use something like sentinel one or even Microsoft Defender for Business.  

4) This tip has saved our clients a lot of headaches.  Have your IT folks set the logo on your Office 365 login page to your company logo.  Educate staff so that if they don't see the firm logo not to log into that page

5) Get cybersecurity education from a company like KnowBe4.  There are a lot of anti phishing tools that are available.  You can test users and if they fail they get training auto assigned.

6) Make sure your IT department has inTune setup and computers encrypted 

7) Firewalls, small firms are great using Meraki's line of products.  Avoid Sonicwalls and Watchguards.  Ubiquiti's gear is okay in a pinch

8) Block all USB storage on computers and use a secure messaging platform like Apprivier 

9) If you use Office365 for emails, have your IT firm flag emails that are external.  This will help a lot with spoofing attacks.

10) Stop letting users use personal devices for out of office work, get them firm issued computers and bring them under your security structure.

> 1) I have a DND sign on my door. If I’m actually busy (like on a call or in phone court) I just ignore the knocking. People know not to open my door when the sign is up unless it’s really, super urgent - like I’ve said “when these documents come in, bring them to me immediately, I don’t care what I’m doing” or “the building is on fire.” For you, you have a lock. That + DND sign + not answering should get the hint across. 

2) Ask them to make a list of questions and bother you once every two hours, or twice a day, rather than wandering in and out of your office whenever they have a thought.

3) If you walk out of your office (bathroom, drink), stop by their desk to answer questions. Tell them you will be doing this so that they can compile their questions and ask them all at once. 

4) Have you told him directly that when the DND sign is up, you can’t be disturbed?

5) How often is your DND sign up? I try to use mine only when I really need peace, to keep people from thinking “oh, she always has it up, it doesn’t mean anything.” 

6) Start redirecting them to other resources, if possible. Like other paralegals. Train them to seek help from others before coming to you.

> None. I'm a paralegal.

Literally the definition of my job is to be more efficient than AI. I'm also creative, which by definition, AI is not. 

Just this morning, I had a great example of why AI sucks. Google is now so pro-AI that it has made the top search results you see "AI generated." My SA asked me a simple question:

> "Find me examples of how third party communication might constitute "unwanted contact' under state stalking statutes.

Google search? A TON of silliness, mostly drawn from the blogs of lawyers trying to get cases.

Ten minutes actually READING the certs in Fastcase and downloading PDFs for her? What we needed.

You ask about summarizing medical records. I do this. As my job. But what _**I**_ do that an AI doesn't is ask my SA what she wants in the summary. Am I looking for a smoking gun, where someone fucked up and we need to prove it? Am I looking for a pattern of wrongfulness? Am I just checking the box because the insurance company demands three years of medical records before processing the claim?

The /r/paralegal subreddit is full of angsty worry about "how is AI going to change our jobs" but the truth is... at its best, it is another tool to research. But I guarantee (for example), an AI is not going to read an IDI/SRO report and know what is the best way to serve someone. Nor is it good at determining which shell company is the real one and which are the mirrors.

Honestly, the world will be a much better place when people stop asking "how are you using this shiny new tool?" and start asking "so, anything pop up as a game-changer in your investigation, organization, or production of materials?"

For me, admittedly knowing that my job LITERALLY depends on being better than "AI"... short answer is nope. Free Lexis access in my county law library has been 1000X more valuable than "AI" tools.

> I'm not an attorney, but I've both had this problem and have shared this advice in the past. You need to establish *communications rules* with everyone who contacts you. Here are the elements:

**Rule 1: Channel Dictates Urgency**

You have several communications channels: snail mail, fax (lol legal industry), email, Teams messages, calls, text messages. First, pare them down. Throw away the fax machine.

Next, organize these channels in a hierarchy based on how quickly people need a *reply* from you: emails are non-urgent FYIs, phone calls are "I am literally in jail right now," and everything else goes on a ladder somewhere in between.

Finally, communicate that hierarchy to people who communicate with you. An email footer that reminds people that you only check your inbox twice a day can go a long way toward training people to communicate urgency elsewhere.

**Rule 2: Urgency Dictates Response Time**

Not everything needs your attention right now, or today, or this week, or *ever*. Once you've established your channel system, set expectations on response times. *All* of my clients know to email me reports but to Slack me time-sensitive questions because I've educated them on my process. I clear my inbox by the end of the day, but sometimes I don't address low-urgency items until the end of the week. However, if I get a phone call, I stop what I'm doing to answer it.

In other industries (like IT) this is called an SLA: a Service Level Agreement. Your clients know that if they email you, they might never hear from you again, but if they text you, they'll get a response that same day. Use that to organize your workflow and help your clients feel like they know what to expect.

**Rule 3 (for lawyers): Have a Backstop**

If your secretary/case assistant/paralegal doesn't already have delegated access to your inbox, voicemail, and Teams channels, then fix that ASAP. None of this works if you have the constant fear of missing a communication or a filing, so you need a backstop, and it's a good practice anyway. Set the expectation that all of the channels get emptied and scheduled for response every single day so that nothing gets left behind.

Anyway, hope that helps. I'm sure someone is making some "AI" powered thingie to make all of my advice obsolete, but until then, good luck.

> Hi. I’ve been in PI in CA for more than a decade. Both sides. Currently just about a year in on my own practice. 

To answer your questions:

1. About 80% of my cases do not need to be litigated.

2. The Rutter group makes a CA personal injury guide. I’ve used it throughout my career. It’s an excellent resource.

3. Negotiating a PI case correctly requires experience. Value is based on a lot of factors that you can’t really handle without experience.

4. Fees are typically from the gross settlement. My firm does 35% (prelit) and then everything else (special and general damages) goes to the client. But the client has to pay medical bills from that (you are responsible for negotiating and resolving those liens). Client keeps what is left over. Resolving liens (especially statutory liens in CA) can be their own nightmare.

 Lastly, the business side is difficult, but what people often don’t discuss is client management. That’s a headache in its own right. Half my clients are easy to manage. The other half call everyday asking for money, they want loans, they want to know why the other insurance company is denying liability when “it’s clearly the other persons fault”, they want to know why they’re not getting a million dollars from a fender bender when they only treated at an urgent care once and then told doctors they were fine and stopped going to treatment. They’re rude. They make threats.

Then there’s staff management. Super hard to find experienced people without paying a premium. Even then, staff have conflicts sometimes. They have lives and aren’t dedicated to your business sometimes. Sometimes you hire someone who seems like a good fit and they aren’t. All of those things cause headaches.

Then again, if you know the current place isn’t a long term fit, personally, that answers the question. Life is short. We spend all our f’in time in the office. Find an office you want to be in. Then do good work, optimize your economics, and the money will come.

These are objective facts, but unless you were looking at a stop watch or had a radar gun, well-intended answers can be vastly wrong.

I can't count the number of times a deponent has given a crazy estimate, such as they stopped 100 feet behind the car in front of them at a stop light (Really?  1/3 of a football field?)  Or they were waiting at a stoplight fir about 10 minutes before the collision (No you weren't), or that the car that rear ended the had to be going 50 MPH (As evidenced by the minor scuff on your rear bumper).

I always tell my clients not to speculate. Do not give a best guess.  Do not give an estimate.  A smart attorney will use it against you.

I work only contingent fee. Contingent fees (and flat fees) incentivize efficient use of time. Hourly rates incentivize using time.

I’d also encourage you to ask around at the CLEs you do go to, your own network, and national org listserv  what those folks are finding helpful. Then use your own judgment.

> This will always be specific to the firm. No one here can give you a reliable answer. For example, my firm allows you to enter non-billable time when doing anything that benefits the firm but doesn't get billed to a client. That includes CLE, pro bono, training, etc. But at the same time, using non-billable time is only intended to explain what you did with your day of you aren't meeting goals - it's to help us see if there's a problem. Once an attorney consistently meets goal, they stop entering non-billable time, because no one cares. Your firm may approach it differently. 

In other words, this is something you have to ask your firm. If you don't want to go to the boss, ask a senior associate or the office manager.

> I had a lot typed out but realized I was overcomplicating things unnecessarily.

The goal is to save time attorney time and interruptions on client intakes. The solutions depend on a lot of information we don't have such as your area of practice, average intake call time, conversion rate, and conversion value. Regardless, here are some ideas:

How often does a conflict check done by the attorney result in finding a conflict? If it's often, that needs to be done by support staff to eliminate those wasted attorney calls.

How long does the average intake call take? The goal is to reduce that time without reducing your conversion rate. It seems an easy way to do this is to stop letting potential clients who just want to rant waste your time. Figure out some lines relevant your type of work that can be used to escape clients who want to waste your time.

Another idea to save intake time is to make an intake questionnaire to standardize the important questions you need answered to assess the case. If the ranters want to rant, then: "the details of your case are always important but I want to get some basic information first so I can contextualize those details." Then, by the the time it's their turn to rant, you already know if their case is crap or not. If they have no case you politely end the call after sympathizing the brief ranting you allow them using the lines from above. If it's a good case you let them rant as long as they want.

You have 5 attorneys doing intake calls who don't want to be interrupted throughout the day? There are 5 days in the week. Assign each attorney to a day (rotating schedule to account for holidays and busier days if need be). The lead attorney handles intake calls on their given day. I would avoid assigning a backup attorney as 10 consults should not be taking 8 hours and clients can wait 30 minutes for a call back on occasions where it's needed. Unless that impacts conversion, but I doubt it will.

The best system is probably to have one attorney handle all the intakes. Doing intakes is a skill that can be developed such that you can minimize time taken to make the potential client feel heard, convert more potential clients, and set good expectations for the potential clients who become actual clients. The more someone focuses on it the better the results will be.

For the other white people here ... I agree we (white people) need to better understand what microaggressions look like in legal spaces. I just don't think it's fair to expect someone who is asking for help to be the person to educate us. OP was asking for support with a  problem they are experiencing from other people who have the same issue. If you don't know what problem they are referring to, you aren't in a position to help them so walk on.

If you want to find out what microaggressions are lots of people have done blogs and videos we can use our energy and time to research, rather than making it OPs responsibility. Heck, make your own post and ask the question if you want a chat about it, that way people who have the time and energy can choose to engage with you if they like. But making a person needs help with racism responsible for educating us so that we stop being racist is at best a microaggression in itself, arguably worse.

If this issue is new to you some places to start are 'Why Im no longer talking to White people about Race' by Reni Eddo Lodge or F.D Signifier on you tube. They are people who have kindly put themselves out there to explain some of this.

> The indirect route works better for us - about 3x better conversion rates than direct pitching. 

Our process evolved a lot over time. We start with value-first content (case studies, guides) that naturally leads to a "learn more" CTA. From there, we use a quick qualification form that feeds into an automated follow-up sequence. This gives prospects time to research on their own terms while staying top of mind.

We actually built voice agents to handle the follow-up calls automatically - they qualify, answer FAQs, and book meetings without the awkward sales pressure. Booking rates jumped from \~4% to \~12% when we stopped trying to force immediate calls and let the automation nurture consistently.

The key insight was that most prospects need 5-7 touchpoints before they're ready, but sales teams often give up after 2-3.

> Hi! I've worked in marketing for almost ten years, and now I work at an AI tech company, Botpress, for AI agents and automating workflows. So this is easily one of my favourite topics.

Marketing is broad and can have so many applications, and there are so many ways AI can help.

We’ve deployed hundreds of thousands of chatbots, so this is my area of expertise. The most common use cases are AI lead generation or customer support bots. But conversational AI can handle almost anything, both internal and external. 

The main reasons people use chatbots, is for:  
\- Lead generation. It's an easy bonus of any chatbot, and it can really streamline the process.  
\- 24/7 customer support  
\- Multilingual support, providing responses in multiple languages, adapting to the user’s preferred communication style  
\- Data collection, chatbots quietly gather details like what customers want, what they’re asking, and how they interact  
\- Customer or staff onboarding. A chatbot can provide tutorials, address common concerns and answer FAQs  
\- Digital business development representatives. Chatbots qualify leads by asking key questions, segmenting users, and passing warm prospects to the sales team  
\- Gathering feedback and reviews. Chatbots can prompt users for reviews or surveys after specific interactions,  
\- Simplified event promotion, having a chatbot there to answer FAQs, share registration links, and send reminders.

Our marketing team uses bots and AI agents to:  
\- Analyze competitor websites and provide competitive intelligence  
\- Send personalized follow-up emails  
\- Analyze product signals to suggest who is ready for an upgrade



Also, you can use machine learning (the use of algorithms that learm from data to automate, optimize, and personalize) for:

\- Personalized content, on the homepage or category pages, add ons in the cart, which emails a customer receives, or personalize email content based on behaviour, recommending which product should appear in a dynamic block for each person.  
\- Email marketing, to predict open rates, and optimize send times, subject lines, or content variations.  
\- Predictive analytics. Once trained, the model can score new leads, campaigns, or customers in real time based on how closely they match past success signals.  
\- Customer segmentation, grouping people by behaviour rather than demographic. Such as by browsing patterns or purchase frequency.  
\- Churn prediction, to flag which customers are likely to disappear by learning from past behaviour, like drops in usage, skipped renewals, or slow response times before someone leaves.   
\- Ad targeting and optimization, steering your funds towards winning combos.  
\- Sentiment analysis, it can process massive volumes of open-text feedback from places like reviews, support chats, or social media, and label it with nuanced emotional or intent-based categories.

Honestly, I could write a book on this, so I'll stop here.  
Needless to say, I am a huge

Headline, subheadline, first paragraph or bullets and CTA should answer these questions:
What is it?
Who is it for and what's in it for them?
What should they do next?
See the basecamp.com home page for example. 

Also 
Do you build all types of software (unlikely), so specifically state the type / category of software and apps you build.
Who do you serve, marketing agencies if so say it.
"All-in-one" sounds inappropriate for a service, maybe something like "One-stop-shop"?

I expected to see more on:
- "How it works"? Ie the offer.
- how this compares to say hiring a full-time developer or developers in-house. Make it a no-brainer if you compare the 2 scenarios.

Doing mass outreach using AI is only gonna get you shitty clients that will stop working with you after a month, if that. Send them a video upfron in the outreach and do a personalised email. Much higher chance of getting a client that way

> I just got put on this project in September 2024. I was recruited by a boutique firm to work with their client on a different project and the client hired me as a FTE. 

To answer your question, the company had alot of bloat in their ops, using different SaaS for each step in the process. At one point, I counted 7 SaaS apps. Each just doing one thing. I set them up with a different SaaS that could accomplish what 5 of them could do. With some additional customization,  we were able to automate customer acquisition, onboarding (with the occasional email for the ones that dont get it) , a new self-service portal, and hosting all of the customer snd regulatory reporting data on one platform. 

For each acquisition that we get, we still look at each one, but now the process doesn't spend hours per day processing each lead through serveral different platforms. Almost a one stop shop. We are pretty close to automating regulatory reporting requirements. We will now review a summary report with all required data. Print. Store in file. 

Of course, if something happens to this platform, we're fucked.

> Just an old retired consulting partner's perspective here. The whole case thing has gotten out of control. We always gave cases, but they were relatively simple and straightforward. They were mainly to test whether you understood basic concepts, could structure a process, could do some basic math in your head and approximate (not fall into the engineer trap of trying to be overly precise), and how well you dealt with some pressure and push-back. The idea was to understand how you would behave in front of a client and how you carried yourself.

Before retiring, I did recruiting at HBS, Booth, etc. as the cases matured and grew in length and complexity. I was always amazed at how "formulaic" responses became i.e., here's the part where they restate the problem and tell we what kind of case it is, here's the part where they say can I take a few moments to jot down some notes, here's the part where they look for some confirmation, etc. I'd often push back with comments like, "I don't buy that that is important, why do you think it is?" just to see how candidates react. Always amazed me how many people backed off when pressed, even when they were right. I also often asked tangential questions like, "I'm the client ... tell me why I should hire your firm to do this job?" Got a lot of deer in the headlights on that one, but it is fundamental.

Saw a deck from Booth's consulting club the other day that was 400 pages of case examples and tips on answering them. Maybe it's different when you're being interviewed by a more junior person, but if a partner's interviewing they are looking for how you are going to interact with a client, what personality type you are, and how well you are going to represent the firm. IMHO.

Of course, completely flubbing the case won't help you either ... 

To answer op's question ... if it's a growth problem stop thinking about how many different "frameworks" could apply. Pick what you think is salient, structure an approach to addressing the client's key issues, and have strength of conviction that you are right. Don't try and present the whole laundry list and look to me to tell you if the right one is in there or not.

Maybe I'm just getting old and the consulting industry isn't what it used to be ... Apologies for the old guy rant!

> Over the past year, I transitioned out of consulting, aiming to move into a more operational and commercially focused role within tech, retail or FMCG. I had a few years of experience in consulting, and figured it would be a fairly quick pivot. It wasn’t. After 12 months, 53 applications, and a lot of interviews, I finally landed a role that fits both what I’m good at and what I actually want to do.

**Here’s what I learned along the way:**

* My **interview rate landed around 35%**, whether I sent tailored applications or applied in bulk. That taught me to stop obsessing over every line in my CV and instead focus on keeping up momentum and staying consistent over time.
* To help with that, I built a **ChatGPT assistant** that scanned job ads and auto-generated a tailored LaTeX CV, selecting the most relevant experiences and adapting the phrasing to match the role. It saved a ton of time and helped me scale my applications without compromising quality.
* I also used **ChatGPT’s voice mode** as a mock interview coach. I’d practice answering questions out loud, then ask for feedback on my tone, clarity, and structure. It helped me improve quickly and feel much more confident going into second and final rounds.
* First interviews are about s**howing curiosity, positivity, and that you’ve done your homework.** Being prepared and asking thoughtful questions consistently helped me move forward in the process more than preparing the perfect STAR-story.
* **Final rounds are all about your story and luck**. I only started converting when I could clearly explain why I was the obvious fit, connecting my background, my motivation for the role, and my long-term goals into one simple, coherent narrative.

I stopped by to mention Afforai for research. This is probably the last time I'll bring it up, but I've been using it intensely the last couple months for a research project and it's helped a lot. Afforai is a tool for academic researchers. It has an AI chat that's connected to Google Search and Google Scholar (academic papers). It's trained to answer in mini essays, so if you ask it a question it will go do research and come back with a mini report using sources. It's pretty neat. There's also a research organizer section for you to build your own library of sources. If you attach PDFs (it can sometimes help find them, or you just upload it yourself), then you can chat with the document or with a collection of documents, and it keeps separate track of your notes and AI chats with the documents. Also super neat, particularly when you are operating off formal research that is clunky in language and tens of pages long.

My company uses Microsoft (MS), so I tag emails into one of those 4 quadrants on my MS To Do List. I've realized if I complete the 3-5 takes I MUST do each day, it allows me to stay organized, stay prioritized, and walk away from work care free. At 3PM, I stop, work on my list for the next day, add notes, attachments and write a brief description of what I need to do. Then I finish up anything I was going to work on for the next day marked important / not urgent. 

The more you stay on top of your list, the more it gives you the power to stay on top of things, stay organized, prioritized, and walk away from work. Even better, I don't immediately answer emails because they either fall into important / not urgent or urgent / not important. I've come to realize a lot of people make smoke but there's no fire. 

Hope that helps!

> I stopped wasting time on wrong AI tools 

I have tried using AI for literally everything, hoping they'd make my projects run smoother and faster. AI seemed like it would change the way we handle everyday tasks. But often, it just led to more confusion and didn't deliver what it promised. After navigating through this mess, I've learned which tools really work and which don't and this is really important to know that using the right tools can literally increase your productivity 10x.

Before you try to find any tools, there are some crucial things to keep in mind:

1. Understand the Value of Time-Saving: The first revelation came when I realized not all AI tools are designed to save time; some complicate simple tasks under the guise of advancement. It's crucial to identify tools that genuinely optimize your workflow.

2. Embrace Experimentation with Caution: Experimentation is vital, but it’s equally important to be critical. I learned this the hard way when an AI logo maker, despite its promises, required more manual tweaks than anticipated, turning "time-saving" into a time sink.

3. Seek Community Feedback: I started engaging more with forums and user reviews, which opened my eyes to real-world performances of these tools, beyond the flashy demos. Using discord channels and subreddit reviews can be pretty useful in this case.

4. Focus on Compatibility and Integration: The best tools are those that seamlessly integrate into existing workflows rather than requiring you to build around them. 

5. Prioritize Tools That Learn and Adapt: AI tools that adapt to user input and improve over time proved to be more beneficial, enhancing their utility with every use.

6. The Simplicity Factor: Often, the simplest tool provides the most value. A straightforward interface with powerful functionality beats a complex tool that promises the world but delivers an atlas instead.

### This Month’s Top AI Tools That Are Truly Useful:

- Uizard:  An AI-powered design tool that simplifies the process of turning ideas into designs and prototypes with a user-friendly interface 

- Replai: Optimizes social media engagement by analyzing posts and determining the best times for publishing to maximize visibility and interaction

- UseChannel: Asks questions in plain English and generates data-driven answers, acting like a personal data analyst 

- Dora AI: This tool allows you to design and publish 3D and animated websites using just plain text, transforming static designs into immersive experiences. Specially if you launching a new online business, this can be very powerful. 

- Lumiere3D: Tailored for e-commerce, this tool helps businesses create interactive 3D product visualizations for enhanced online customer experiences

If you have ADHD, you are cycling around stimuli if you’re emulating holding a conversation. Much like looking up while driving and noticing you missed the light turning green, you put context together at the yellow light of silence and assume the conversation is over. Since they just stopped talking (your ADHD had you not paying attention when they said their half of closing pleasantries) you hit the gas to not sit through the red light of social graces.

Further, as someone with ADHD, one will be overeager to move to the next thing, and learning that other people do not think the same as “ourself” is a very common human challenge for every stripe; it’s natural that an ADHD person using them mirror neurons would conclude the other person feels the same way and thus wants to the point answers that don’t tax them (unaware this is not how it feels to the nonADHDer).

> For a typical 3 week DD, first week will feel overwhelming, scheduling expert calls and structuring the market model, meeting target management and information overload on all fronts. You need to survive the first interim delivery, having something to show progress and first view on key topics. Second week key interviews start to get in place,market model becomes populated, you feel more in control. Third week some open topics still make you a bit stressed and you can’t find objective data driven answers. In the end you use what’s provided in the seller material / VDD and client will stop asking questions when they realize the topic simply can’t be solved more rigorously. Knowing that this is the rollercoaster of emotions you will go through make them easier to manage. 

In the end it’s about how high pressure the client puts on you and as u/signal-cartoonist-27 says they theoretically can put really high pressure, but most are reasonable people and realize when they can’t get anything more out of you. To many questions, no other consulting firm would have found the answer anyway.

> I have a position similar to your boss, so that's my perspective. I also don't know your consulting firm set up, but I'll answer using mine as it might be similar. Also, apologies for the use of parentheticals throughout, hopefully it adds rather than confuses. 

I think your boss is moving the goalposts here. Legal says it's fine, and I'm sure legally it is (not a lawyer). Your issue appears to be that this restriction isn't the benefit that 1099 usually has (set your own hours and renegotiate regularly), and therefore you shouldn't be encumbered by W2 style restrictions. 

I would say their expectation of vacation restrictions is fine if you're on assignment through a tasking agreement (if you're expected to perform over 90 days, dropping PTO on them mid-project can screw things up). But if you're between projects, I don't know why this restriction would even be necessary. IMO these restrictions should be listed in your tasking agreement (not your overall company agreement, or the company agreement should state these restrictions being in place while on a tasking agreement). 

You're going to have to be a bit careful here. Your boss has already brought up legal (I don't think anything will happen with that), but it's mentioned because it's a hard stop in negotiating (my hands are tied because legal reviewed it). You also want to make sure there's a good relationship with your boss, because they could absolutely concede to your negotiation, but refuse to task you on projects going forward. 

My suggestion is to agree to the terms if they refuse to change, and start shopping your services elsewhere.

### r/VOIP — 2023-04-03 | 1pts

> > The VoIP service provider does not need to provider any "mobile network services"

You asked why doesn't your TFO request reach from the mobile network to the VoIP network. The simple answer is that the VoIP network isn't a 3GPP-compliant mobile network so you're not going to get such out-of-band requests. 

> Whenever I receive an incoming call from TMO, the only codecs listed in the SDP offer are always PCMU. PCMA and G729 in this order - AMR is not included, even though all "modern" mobile phones use either AMR or AMR-WB, and even GSM/2G uses AMR when it isn't artificially disabled via Bearer Capabilities IE.

Your VoIP provider (or their upstream providers) likely only supports PCMU, PCMA, and G729. Even if T-Mobile's network edge offered AMR-NB, AMR-WB, or other codecs, intermediate hops can (and do) strip out unsupported codecs. 
AMR-WB is still patent encumbered so its usage outside of mobile networks is quite limited. 

> But if I reject G.729 and only connect to my VoIP provider in G.711, then I should be getting unadulterated access to the "common language" interconnect by which any one telco talks to any other telco.

You're not getting unadulterated access. You are going through at least one network handoff and likely multiple. At each handoff, the peering SBCs on each side have to be configured for what each side is willing to support and generally will drop anything else.

I have experienced much push back in school, in psychiatry, and in religion as a child and still experience negative outcomes as an outlier at my age. (Theoretically) people don’t like that I don’t feel the need to change my opinions or personality to fit in and brand me as “bad”. I get accused of all kinds of stuff I’m not doing, every time it’s some different outlandish accusation with no proof and sometimes irrefutable proof of the contrary.

Yes, I work a soulless government job for one of my sources of income which I’ve basically been quiet quit ting for years and the other I work for myself co-managing a research group studying an online chat therapy service and an AI chat therapy service we’ve developed to make therapy more cheaper and more accessible to the masses (we are blessed with a founder who funds the project without needing to make profit). I obviously have more passion for the latter project.

So the reason I’m explaining who I am and what I do and what my experiences have been are because based on just this one video, I don’t see what the push back on this guy is about. I totally have not looked at anything else from him yet, but I thought all of his info in the video seemed correct. I’m not all that good on history or some of the other subjects mentioned so it’s possible I’m wrong and it’s bullshit. But I certainly can contest that my experience as an outsider has led me to draw similar conclusions about the US education system and I really have a hard time believing that he’s wrong. 

Could anyone enlighten me please? I’m willing to head out any opposing opinions and potentially change my own. Thanks in advance of anyone answers!

> I understand that right now you might not have an answer for this yet, but it’s useful to consider what specifically you will provide as a data analyst.

Because you’re used to working within an org that is familiar with what you do (even if it does not feel like that from where you’re standing), it’s likely that you will need to develop and refine the way you talk about your work. This is common and normal for experts that start selling their services.

Your clients know much less about the intricacies of what you do than what you probably assume, so  it’s necessary to learn how to talk about what you do in a way that connects to them (e.g. data quality is necessary for AI use, so if they are feeling the AI FOMO, there’s a hook there).

I quite like the book The Business of Expertise, from David C Baker.

It has helped me frame this stuff.

> Classic burnout description. Some facts to consider: 

The higher in an organization you go, and companies in general, the fewer of those jobs there are and more competition for them.  Higher and higher rank, fiercer and fiercer competition.

Performance evaluations are designed to squeeze more out of each employee every review cycle and make them feel bad for any small areas of lower productivity. 

Companies are financial instruments, despite whatever technology or solutions (goods and services) they are providing. They are structured so that shareholder value is maximized and the only way the company remains at the top of its industry is to increase its value every quarter or face \*active\* devaluation by the marketplace. Even flat growth is considered untenable.  There must be upward, increasing valuation.

In order to not face devaluation, a company must somehow convince or coerce its workforce to do more. They cannot ever effectively hire at a rate commensurate with the need for quarterly expansion and still increase value. Hiring means money -> out, and there is a lag because hiring takes time. The value has to come from somewhere, and it's not by fair & equal distribution of work.

By participating in this system, you are giving approval to your company to inflict these pressures on you.  Even if you have the nicest boss and team in the world, those pressures are omnipresent in the economy and will find you eventually.

You may either participate willingly or unwillingly, but if you wish to receive the compensation that you do, you will need to participate.  Your burnout is immaterial to the company, no matter what they say to you or what programs or support they offer.

So, what to do?  Find a way.  You can job hop and experience that 6 month to a year honeymoon phase over and over.  You can become very good at enforcing your personal boundaries and become diplomatically skilled to never confront your employer about it and create any tension, but the net result is you have a life outside of work.  You can look for a company where the pressures I wrote about are not extreme and it's more comfortable.  You can grit your teeth and bear it.  You can make waves and "try to change company culture" LOL.  You can start your own consulting company or individual practice and take on those market pressures personally instead of having them imposed on you by a corporate structure.  You can change careers to something you consider more fun.  You can work work work to save money and then quit and take a long leave because you want to.

There are several options.  None of which are finding a way to operate outside of this financial system.  Not for the level of compensation you are getting.  Sure, some people get lucky and write a book or create a bit of culture that makes them rich, or win a lottery.  Probabilistically, that is not going to happen.

> Hi there, I see that comment section is already full of answers. So, here’s my personal experience which i feel might add some value or insight. 


I started with a MBB straight from my undergrad school and then quit after ~20 months. 

It was a great start and learning experience was phenomenal at first but last year I was staffed in the Pre sales (non billables) due to low projects in the pipeline (that was their explanation). I was told to work there for 6 months but I could see that it was not going to end for another year. I communicated this issue to the staffing and the management but no avail despite other members getting actual projects in between. After a while it occurred to me that was not at all meaningful or impactful and would severely hamper my promotion, yet I decided to work since it had a good visibility and engagement with the leadership. 

Ultimately at the turn of the year, I decided to pull the plug and take the matter into my own hands. 

It was difficult without a job in hand, but I did and I landed a job in Analytics at one of the big financial services company. 

2 months into the job, I am blown away by the culture, diversity (no target schools, everyone welcomed by their ability) and work life balance. 
The best part is the sheer amount of learning (infinite training sessions and internal courses) and the opportunity to lead the projects. 

At first it doesn’t feel like impactful work, but when i remember the impact shown on diagnostic vs the actual implementation I feel i made the right choice of leaving that MBB. I value personal time, flexibility and career advancement more instead of exit opportunities.

> Your first level hypothesis is too specific. It should simply be "The hospital should offer the additional medical service." 

The next step is to explore the factors that may or may not support this. It doesn't matter whether the answers align to your first level hypothesis or not. What you're doing is gathering insights to draw a holistic picture to form a conclusion.

So a hypothesis approach for basic categories such as product and company might look like this:  


Product (gathering information about that product that make it appealing to offer)

1. What is the product?
2. Does it differ to our existing offerings?
3. Does it have advantages? 

If the results are positive, you can draw a conclusion that the product offering is good

Company  (gather information about the company so you can see whether the offering strategically aligns or synergises)  


1. Do we currently have the capability to deliver this offering (tech, workforce, op model
2. Is further investment required? If so, can we afford and implement in a timely manner?
3. Does it align to our strategic goals (market share, patient outcomes, profit)

Notice how they're quite open questions and your final conclusion could be something like:  


Our initial assessment indicates that the hospital should offer the additional medical service for three reasons.

1. The new offering is a complementary treatment to our existing options and doesn't replace them, allowing for bundled treatment options with higher profitability
2. The new offering will support our strategic goal of improving cancer patient care outcomes by 20%
3. No additional training is required for our current workforce and the infrastructure investment will be recovered within 6 months of full operations

The next step we recommend is to explore the customer demand and competitor landscape to further the market viability and profitability of the offering.

> I (occasionally) and others (some much more often) have retainer-based arrangements for business consulting, i.e. pay a monthly fee for essentially unlimited advice/guidance in our area.

It can work quite well and be quite lucrative, but the client's own time acts as an important limiter. By that I mean that the client needs to get on the phone with me to talk, or at least has to sit down and write a well-thought-out, well-structured question in an email, one that I might take from 10 minutes to an hour or even two to answer, but still it needs to start by them dedicating time. That means that the amount of support under the retainer is naturally limited by how busy the client is.

I think this would require more care for tech professional services, especially where you're actually implementing something rather than just advising. That's because I think many smart clients could easily think up an describe an endproduct in 10 mins that takes more than a day to implement. And then change their mind the next day.

So - sounds great. But think through what will be the natural demand limiter (or at least prioritizer) in your case.

> First of all, in the spirit of the thread - honesty - I’m not quite sure if your questions are truly questions looking for legitimate answers; an attempt to hide cynicism and passive aggression towards someone who may symbolise something you’ve developed resentment or disdain for; or, just a time waster. However, I’ll give it a naive shot, assuming the best intention in you. 

1) I don’t think it is. In fact, I found that the truly successful ones, beyond the business life itself, including other aspects of their lives, seem to be the ones who aren’t. If you only measure income success, there is a mix of personalities, perhaps pretty much reflecting a similar psychological profile as any affluent group put together. So, it’s a mix bag truly. 

2) on teammates, I find ways to understand the reasons for the complication. When I feel we are incompatible, then I work towards parting ways with that individual in a respectful but clear way where I don’t seek to interact with them unless inevitable. It happens with more frequency than most may admit. If the complication is more centred on specific views, choices or styles, then I generally seek common ground by openly discussing where we are seemingly divergent. 
On clients, it truly depends. If they are large clients of the firm, I tolerate a lot more and try to find the good in the situation. It’s certainly not easy. When those are clients that are more transactional in nature, it’s about finding what makes them tick and going along with it. Sometimes it doesn’t work and you naturally “lose” the client or simply stop winning work. It’s good for everyone. 

3) my marriage is fine. I wouldn’t blame my work for any shortcomings. I think work only hides a deeper issue. It rarely is the cause. I find that lots of people who face marriage breakdown added to pile of discontentment via work (more as a psychological excuse) than actually the root cause. I don’t discard some folks are workaholics but again, it’s probably a reflection of deeper issues or insecurities. I’ve dealt with some of those and I credit my personal Christian faith as being the cornerstone to turning around my priorities in life to what really matters. I fail often but we are a lot better than many years ago. So, all in all, I think I’ve got a good marriage. 

4) I’ve answered this questions many times here and in many ways. I wholeheartedly suggest you read my answers if you’re truly seeking deeper understanding. In a nutshell, I deeply care about my family, community and to some extent general strangers who are struggling in life. In my own ways I find opportunities to prioritise with the right amount of time and financial (as relevant) investment each of those nodes in my network. Basically, God (my faith, my wife and children, my broader family, friends, community, strangers.. 

5) that’s indeed a great question. Originally, a few weeks ago when I wrote it, I simply felt in my heart on that day that I could contribute something back to

1. A good and affordable AI receptionist that can clone a custom human voice and automate my intake into CRM. 

2. 	Workflow automation – making documents and tasks move without manual chasing.

3.	Client follow-through – getting clients to sign, fund, or comply.

4.	Template management and formatting – preserving exact legal formatting in Word or PDFs.

> That 2 AM traffic is a goldmine most law firms miss! We had a similar issue with our legal clients - they'd get form submissions overnight but couldn't respond until morning, by which time potential clients had already contacted 3 other firms.

We built our AI Receptionist to solve this exact problem for law firms. It can handle those late-night inquiries, qualify leads based on practice area criteria, and integrate directly with systems like Lawmatics or Lead Docket. The key difference from services like Ngage is that it's fully automated (no human in the loop) so the economics work even at 2 AM.

One thing we learned from law firm implementations: make sure whatever solution you choose can properly segment by practice area and urgency. For example, a potential client with a time-sensitive criminal matter needs different handling than someone looking for estate planning.

Have you considered adding a website widget that can immediately engage visitors rather than waiting for form submissions? We've seen conversion rates jump significantly when potential clients can get immediate answers to basic questions before deciding to submit contact info.

> My experience with hiring virtual assistants from the Philippines has not been positive. I find that virtual assistants from Latin American countries tend to offer better quality work and a culture that aligns more closely with the West. 

Philippines: I have encountered issues with dishonesty, as some VAs from the Philippines have worked for multiple companies simultaneously despite using time-tracking software. They have tried to cheat or disable my time-tracking software. Additionally, I have observed that their educational qualifications do not reflect a basic level of analytical thinking or problem-solving skills. In my experience, Filipino VAs with "BS or MS degrees" have shown performance levels below those of a high school-educated individual from the West. Dishonesty seems to be a recurring issue with them. If the tasks require any analytical thinking, I have found it challenging to rely on them. 

I am eagerly anticipating advancements in AI to handle virtual receptionist and basic assistant tasks.

> Thanks u/Hi-ThisIsJeff . Your response style is kind enough so now I feel I can speak my mind.

I don't think I am novice. But I am too much interested in what are the problems faced by real people (here, consultants). During my own 17+ years of consulting(most of the time, ERP consulting),  I have worked with people from receptionist to senior most strategists, (govts, private sector..). But nothing felt FULFILLING. They all were representatives of SOME ORGANIZATION, most of the time. 

I am more interested in helping in them solving their most challenging problems with my wide knowledge of techs (like Deloitte solved the complex case of bribery using AI as shown in their case study). My initial plan was to help individual consultants develop that kind of wide thinking to pull out very innovative solutions. But seems that I don't have resources to educate them on it. That's why I am thinking to change my model from "course" to "solution"/  


>What is the timeframe required for you to create this new on-demand course?

Rather than course, it's "solution on-demand" service. It goes like this..

Me : Dear(consultant/director).... throw me your some of the most common problems you face and I may be able to  help you.

You (as client): I wish there could be better solution to document version control.

Me : Prepares a full solution (mainly in form of video) and offer the solution for nominal price.

If many consultants are facing this problem, this become my course. So no specific time frame promise, but a good chance of getting rid of their pains.

>What will your custom course offer that I couldn't find on the internet or YouTube today?

If they had found a solution, they wouldn't tell me in first place, I think.

> You skipped right from receptionist to attorney… there are a ton of qualified paralegals who can (and often do) fill that gap. I don’t think AI tools are ready for full PI intakes yet, if only because clients aren’t yet comfortable talking to them. While a good receptionist can certainly take the first 15 minute phone call with a careful script, send it to a paralegal or associate to further qualify that lead and dig in before you sign it and waste time and money pursuing it. 

Just a heads up: I don’t expect that your PI practice will be “a bit of a side project”. It is heavy on paperwork, correspondence, client communication, etc. Have to get medicals, coordinate treatment, check liens, open claims… there is a lot of money to be made but it generally requires a sizable staff and/or lots of deliberate use of vendors.

I've always been very independent in my practice and I haven't had a paralegal I *REALLY* depended on for years. Right now, my wife is helping me with some systems / admin stuff. I have Quo set up for my phone system, which has a nice AI assistant (or you can just opt for traditional voicemail.) I love that it transcribes & summarizes my calls, which I find super helpful, especially on intake calls / negotiations with OC, etc. I am using Practice Panther as my case/task management / document automation / trust accounting software. G-Suite for email. QB for the accounting (this will likely be the first thing I outsource). I also have a very nifty case management app that is highly-tailored to my particular practice/process that I developed with Claude (I have no coding experience) over the course of several months last year. It is a huge time saver for me.

-AI Assistant to help your clients navigate your website more easily, and answer FAQs, 24/7. 
-If the client wants to talk to a live representative, it allows the viewer to book a call, or collect their contact info, so you can reach out to them

-AI Automation systems that are able to do a lot of things automatically , such as reaching out with personalised emails, post content on social media automatically on a schedule, automatic topic researcher, and a lot more systems

-AI phone callers to handle phone calls

-AI content creation to grow your social media profiles, get a bigger audience, gain more trust, and turn viewers into high paying clients. This can be paired with AI automation systems.

All of these tools are MADE FOR lawyers. Implementing them now will boost your law firm. The others who miss out on this opportunity will be left  behind, while you thrive and future proof your business.

If you are considering implementing them, and would like some assistance, I would be more than happy to help and set them up for you.

> If you're a law firm looking to improve your visibility in Google search results—especially local searches—don’t overlook the power of legal directories. Some may be skeptical about their direct lead generation value; however, the *SEO benefits alone can justify the listing*. Here's why:

# ✅ 1. AI & Structured Data Readability

Many legal directories are being scraped by AI and voice search tools like Google's SGE and ChatGPT. Being listed makes your firm more **eligible for inclusion in AI-generated answers** by increasing your digital footprint across trusted platforms.

# ✅ 2. Earn High-Authority Backlinks

Most directories include a dofollow or nofollow link to your website. These **backlinks from trusted, niche-relevant domains** send strong authority signals to search engines. Even nofollow links help diversify your link profile and show relevance within the legal industry.

# ✅ 3. Improve Indexation & Visibility

Your directory profile often ranks in Google for branded and non-branded terms. This **increases your firm's SERP footprint**, giving you more real estate on Page 1 and making it easier for potential clients to find you—even if they’re not searching directly for your site.

# ✅ 4. Boost Local SEO with High-Authority Citations

Legal directories like Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, and Martindale-Hubbell act as structured citations—key elements in local SEO. These listings confirm your firm's name, address, phone number (NAP), and practice areas across the web. Google uses this consistency to verify and trust your business, improving your Google Business Profile rankings.

**Bottom Line:**  
Directories aren’t just about leads—they’re about **trust, consistency, and visibility**. As part of a broader SEO strategy, they help build the foundation that gets your site ranked and trusted.

> Agree with all of the advice here to focus on the fundamentals! 

Something I don't see mentioned here yet is that there's a huge opportunity available now that hasn't been as prevalent in past recessions - AI & automations. During times that you have extra team bandwidth bc of client churn, focus on establishing clear SOPs in Playbooks that show the workflow and steps, and automate the heck out of them. Build agents that support client & team member onboarding and ongoing support. You'll increase your efficiency, and then be able to focus your team's new bandwidth on the personal touches that strengthen client relationships & trust. All the want-to-dos you've always wished you could do to improve the client experience, but sacrificed for the have-to-dos. Casual check-ins, phone calls, text messages, handwritten thank you cards, celebrations, strategy development, ideation... these things are what we all wish we could expand but deprioritize for the sake of the actual service delivery. It feels like overhead, when in reality these are the things that make the bond with the client sticky. This is just scratching the surface - the ability to activate your team on activities that add value, help with retention/upsell, or even getting them involved earlier in the sales process, so much opportunity.

Back to the fundamentals - for marketing & sales focus on filling up the calendar with conversations, both with potential clients and potential referral partners. Seek out potential referral partner relationships (those who work with your audience in the same or alternative capacity). Establish a referral partner program so you stay top of mind with people who also serve your ideal clients, and so you can easily refer to them as well. Make sure you're able to clearly communicate who you help and the problem you solve so it's easy for everyone to know when someone is a good fit for you.

> Here is my concern. 

All this AI outreach and automated messaging, emails, etc. is a short cut. You gain being able to scale but you lose a lot of people who simply don’t like the idea of getting cold outreach with AI.

The big concern should be competitors who understand that this is a people business.   


Marketing deals in human behavior - trying to define a behavior (buy now, download, whatever CTA) then produce/induce that behavior among a group (target market) of people with all of their emotional baggage, distrust, need to connect, biases and more. 

  
That competitor that uses meat intelligence to make prospects feel a connection (trust) based on authenticity will have an advantage. 

Perhaps the scalability is enough to offset this competitive advantage?

My other concern is that LLMs (let’s call it what it is) aren’t very good at human interaction. For example, think of using a chatbot for tech support. In all my years, I’ve never been able to get anywhere - same with AI powered phone trees “I’m sorry. I didn’t catch that…”

Maybe if you were selling a cheap, transactional type of service or product and were really well targeted it could work.

> If I had to boil it down, I would say: stop teaching them how to be machines because AI is already better at that.

In my view, what grads and juniors will need in the next few years does not have much to do with how to build a perfect slide or how to crunch a model in Excel faster..... They will still learn those things, but that won't be the edge anymore. 

The edge will be in the stuff that AI cannot (yet, or maybe never) do well:

- Reading a room when the politics are thick enough to choke on
- Asking the awkward question no one else will
- Seeing the pattern in the mess when there is no dataset yet
- Framing a problem in a way that makes a C-level exec actually listening instead of checking their phone (true story!!)

We should be teaching them how to use AI to clear the grunt work fast, then spend the freed-up time doing the real work: thinking, persuading, building trust, getting decisions made, etc

This is pretty much the kind of shift I wrote about [in here](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr): what keeps you valuable when the technical skills that once set you apart are suddenly just the baseline. Because in 1–3 years, the people who thrive in consulting will be the ones who can turn ambiguity into confidence and get humans to act......... not the ones who can make the prettiest Gantt chart.

> I would try to increase the commercial side and raise your commercial rates.  The residential stuff is, as you know, highly commoditized and really hard to increase revenue without getting a chunk of the title business. (That said, my real estate practice has always been 100% commercial.) 

If you need to add staff, I would be looking offshore and at potential AI solutions. AI can draft a lot of your closing documents, for instance although you probably have software to do that efficiently. I haven’t yet found it ready for prime time but AI receptionist might be a good idea down the road. I think it’ll be ready soon if it isn’t yet. I would keep your W-2 headcount to a minimum.

The truth is, a lot of the “AI receptionist” stuff out there really isn’t ready, and it gives the tech a bad name.
What we’re using is a natural sounding AI voice with real conversational pacing and empathy it’s not a clunky bot reading a script.
We’ve had DUI callers book consults on the spot late at night without even realizing they weren’t speaking to a live person.
If you’re open to it, I can send you a short example so you can hear exactly what it sounds like in a real intake call.

Or I’ve called and left a voicemail and nothing.

We don't even have VM set up on our work number.  I work at a small completely virtual firm with no office and no receptionist.  Work calls go through this automated thing and just get forwarded to our mobiles.  That's happened to me 2x in >5 years lol. If anyone is calling me out go the blue they call my mobile, it is either a colleague or expert I am working with, or an OPC that I have a good enough relationship with to give me cell phone number to.  Latter typically only happens during trial/for urgent things, and even then they usually just text first.  Clients usually just email unless we are traveling together, and then mobile.  I can't even recall the last time I got a work related VM.

### r/VOIP — 2025-08-19 | 2pts

> Depends on the requirements and constraints 

PSTN land line gets its power from the exchange, so it'll work if there's no power to the site

To replicate that with a VOIP phone you need the phone powered by PoE  and the network kit all running on a UPS potentially backed by a generator for the extreme redundancy.

Cordless DECT phones are great, but they need power and they're radio based and as such blocked by things that interfere with radio signals (like big hunks of metal or water). So the position of the base station becomes important, but the same is true for a VOIP solution. To migrate this to VoIP you either need to use an ATA or use a (generally not cheap) DECT VOIP device like a Gigaset or Yealink DECT device.

VOIP devices have firmware and an end of life and end of support constraint. Depending on how they connect you may run into obsolescence and need to replace them every five years. You have configurations to manage, password to periodically rotate, etc. A PSTN phone just plugs in and works.

You need to account for infrastructure, what wiring is kn place, is if cat3, cat5, cat5e, cat6, etc. Is this routed to the right place.   Are you upgrading an older hotel and need to connect all those room phones using a 24 or 48 port ATA, or can you replace all those phones and replicate the required functionality by programming those phones.

Are you linking multiple locations together, do you need to centralize calling.

Do you need to enable calling between multiple devices, or call parking, paging, intercom, conferences (3-way, or more), call transfers, voicemail, call recording, etc. Do you have faxes to deal with, alarm systems, older monitoring systems (had a sewage treatment plant that needed a phone line via VOIP once), health alert systems, etc.

What's the connectivity throughput and minimum bandwidth guarantees. Do they need encrypted calls? Do they have a good quality router where SIP ALGs can be turned off.

Is it easier to give people just a mobile or an eSIM instead.

There are so many considerations, constraints, and requirements for both the home or a business. Deciding which is better is not easy to answer.

Ideally you want to do VOIP, it makes things simple in some ways, but harder in others. You need more computer networking understanding for it, whilst a PSTN is trivial.

Debugging call issues with the PSTN is trivial, a volt meter and a landline phone or linesmans handset is enough.

Debugging VOIP calls can involve network packet captures and digging through the SIP and RTP/SRTP traffic. But it could also be an ALG, DNS, STUN/TURN/ICE, network issues, etc

What are the requirements, what are you trying to achieve, what are the constraints. Those questions will help you decide.

Note: I've been building VOIP phone systems for nearly 20 years now, with a variety of PSTN integrations.

> It feels weird to fire a client, but oftentimes it's the right thing to do. It's a two-way street. As an agency owner, you should want to business with those who value your services, and where you value their relationship.

I've got a couple instances where, over the course of 17 years of running an agency, I fired a client. It's so  liberating to get rid of "Karen the Clients". They usually email/demand something, and then leave voicemail messages later in the day asking about the status of their demands. 

The final straw for me for one "Karen the Client" is when she replied-all to their entire organization, saying how my team and I never followed up with her request from months prior. This was in February. Her original request was received over Christmas break, and was followed up with next business day, with a request for more information.

Two months goes by and she never replied with the information request we had. When she finally did her reply-all rant, I had had enough. 

After careful though, I crafted a polite email to her and the rest of organization that we no longer wished to business with them. We gave them three or four months to find another provider.

Two or three months later, a local competitor of ours asked for us to release the domain name to them and help with transferring the content. They were taking over the account. (yay!)

At the time I was living in a small town and we all know who our competitors are. I told the new agency that I'd stop their office and help. Then I gave them the scoop about why "Karen the Client" was leaving us...because I fired her and she was a PITA. I figured it was good to let the new agency should know what they're getting into.

> Do you think you were the victim of a bait and switch regarding the job you thought you were applying to? Or, once you were in the interview, did they determine that you don't have the skills they need for a legal assistant so they then pivoted to discussing a mailroom position? The distinction makes a big difference. If you applied to a job posted as "legal assistant" but they started off right away discussing a mailroom job, that's not a good sign and I probably wouldn't proceed with them. 

If it's the latter and they said something like, "I don't think your skills and experience match with our needs for a legal assistant at this point, but we're willing to move forward with a mailroom position," then that means they see something in you even though you might not be a fit for the original position. That would be a different story and I might consider moving forward.

Law firms can be great places to work and grow, and in my experience they often prefer promoting from within (it's easier to hire a new mailroom assistant or receptionist than an experienced legal assistant or paralegal). I've seen this happen many times. So it's completely reasonable that this could happen to you if you get the job. But remember job interviews are a two-way street. Dig into that a little more if you get a second interview and ask them how often they do promote from within, and make it clear to them that this is important to you. If they seem honest and sincere and you feel comfortable with the folks you've met and the answers to your questions, you might want to consider moving forward.

The biggest difference is they only work with law firms. Smith was fine but their receptionists handle calls for dentists, plumbers, everyone - so they never really understood the nuances of legal intake. Claire's team actually knows what questions to ask for a PI consult vs a family law matter without me having to spell everything out.

Customer service has been night and day too. When I need to update my call script or tweak something, I actually get a response same day. With Smith I'd wait 3-4 days sometimes and then they'd still get it wrong.

Setup was super easy and my intake quality went way up. I'm a solo PI attorney so every lead matters - can't afford to have someone botch the first impression.

> The biggest thing I look for in a legal assistant (receptionist too) is willingness to learn - like actually learn why we do something, so that you can appropriately do it later - common sense, and initiative. That’s most of what it takes for that kind of job, plus people skills. Write things down and ask good questions (ex. Less “I know you showed me this yesterday, can you show me again?” and more “I know you showed me this yesterday, but we did X - since this matter is different because of [whatever], does that change anything?”).

As for people skills, remember that you need to be polite and professional, but you are not being paid enough to handle emotional abuse. If you are being yelled at, remember that you will have all of the knowledge, and none of the power. So either clients can listen while you tell them how to help themselves, or they can call you back when they’re ready to have a professional conversation with you. Sometimes clients just want to yell and be heard, and then they calm down. If they don’t calm down after minute or two of you validating their feelings and moving along to a solution, it’s time to tell them to call you back when they’re ready to discuss the matter with you. Allowing them to continue to yell at you will, by and large, get you nowhere.

> 1. During training, take detailed notes about your training and refer back to those notes before asking for help. Keep taking notes as you learn so you can keep referring back to them, rather than asking the same questions again because you’ve forgotten.

2. Take initiative and ownership of the firm’s success. When I was a legal assistant at a small firm I became invested in then success of the partner I worked for. Being bought in made me a better employee and that partner valued that I was looking out for them and trying to anticipate their needs. In the receptionist context, this means getting ahead of daily tasks, getting answers for clients that you can take back to them, and asking legal assistants and paralegals what you can take off their plate, which will increase your own value to the firm and broaden your skills. 

3. Attention to detail. Proof your emails and anything you write before you send or submit anything. Take good notes when relaying any messages to clients.

4. ^ Goes with the last one but CYA. Clients will absolutely misrepresent things you tell them - sometimes intentionally. Having notes of those interactions and action items resulting from those interactions will help protect the firm and protect yourself.

5. Find a way to manage your to-dos. If you use Microsoft or a Google suite I utilized tasks/reminders with a color coded system. Green meant complete; yellow meant in progress; and red meant to be done. I also used calendar reminders all the time to make sure I kept up with deadlines and reviewed what was ahead for the week on Monday morning to best situate myself.

6. Positivity is contagious. You are the voice and face for the firm. Being courteous and upbeat goes a long way.

Best of luck!

We offer the opportunity to fill an intake form online. It is rarely used and only sometimes useful.  Intake has to be interactive with the answer to one question determining the substance of the next question. 
AI could help with that but prospects don’t want to communicate with AI.  They want to communicate with a person.  In fact that seems to be where you are.  You want to get through so you can make an appointment to see a person.  I get where you might be frustrated if you aren’t dealing with a person and only leaving a message, but even my two receptionists can’t answer every call as it comes in and it might go to voicemail.

> I mean, if your main need is receptionist-type work — things like scheduling, call forwarding, or collecting basic info — then a standard receptionist service should work fine.

In our case though, our firm needed something more intake-focused rather than just receptionist support. We looked into a few options that could replicate a proper intake call and eventually tried Arka AI, which handled deeper intake more like a paralegal would.

For us, the goal was to make the client experience smoother — so they don’t have to follow up multiple times or repeat the same information. That’s ultimately why we went with a service like this. But honestly, for simpler workflows, a regular receptionist or receptionist assistant is usually enough.

Once you start down that path, revenue attribution becomes meaningless. GAAP accounting is very clear: attorney work is direct revenue, and paralegal work is support that improves capacity and efficiency. It has real value, but not by slicing up revenue in a way that ignores basic business principles. Profitability is measured by accurate attribution and margin analysis, not by philosophical revenue-sharing.

It's a common problem in very small firms - especially if there's two partners and they're married to each other! - for the owner/partners to fail to maintain enough separation between their personal and professional lives.  It causes drama and dissatisfaction.  Don't ask your legal secretary to do personal errands; the secretary will resent doing them and your partner will resent paying for them.  If personal services are what you need the most help with, hire a personal assistant, on your own dime not the firm's; be clear about your expectations, treat the assistant with respect and pay them well.  

Also don't ask either a legal assistant or a personal assistant to clean the office.  Get a janitor for that.

> I am a paralegal.  What I did today included (but was not limited to) attending a weekly practice group coordination meeting, reviewing an updated closing checklist received from lender counsel and emailing her a document that was done but hadn't been sent to her yet, conferring with an associate about an unusual tax issue in a contract we're working on together and making some revisions to the contract, responding to an email from a client about a minor change he wants to the draft contract I sent him last week, drafting an operating agreement amendment and a couple of authorizing resolutions and sending them to my supervising attorney for review before they go to lender counsel.  Next on my list is drafting an easement agreement, which I'll send to a different supervising attorney for review before it goes to the client. 



I've been doing this work for a long time, but even less experienced paralegals should not be spending a lot of time answering calls, making copies, and scanning.  It sounds like you want a secretary/legal assistant, or possibly just a receptionist or file clerk.  And if you're constantly asking paralegals to do admin support work, it's not terribly surprising that they've just stopped responding to you.  Although based on your description of the general situation in your organization, I have to wonder, who hired these paralegals, what *is* their actual job description, and how are their duties assigned?  It's unlikely that they truly aren't doing *anything*, so what is it that they *are* doing and why is it invisible to you and other lawyers?  Presumably in a nonprofit you don't have the billable/nonbillable distinctions that generally separate paralegals from LAs, and you may very well not have an abundance of staff so the job descriptions of those you do have may need to be hybrid.  But clearly there's a mismatch of expectations.  And you're not going to resolve that without involving whatever the higher management level is in your company - the general counsel, perhaps, or whoever is the administrator of the legal department.

> Actually just worked on a project where we tried to Define and write down the specific job duties for legal secretaries and paralegals.    

Some of this is going to be very specific to the environment.  For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. 

What we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training 

Attorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. 

Second, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. 


A really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. 

However getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done. At the beginning it will definitely take longer because you are having to teach someone how to do it rather than simply do it yourself. 

With that said a good paralegal should be able to
- keep files in order and ensure new items are filed correctly. 
- keep up with notes and summaries enabling an attorney to catch up on a file quickly 
- draft simple documents like cover letters and rote pleadings from forms for your approval.  (You dont need to be a lawyer to write "the defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 7" over and over again). 
- calendar deadlines
- work on service of process 


If you are the manager. Think about 5 tasks that you feel like waste your time and keep you from doing productive work.  Write down step by step directions for those tasks and then talk to a paralegal. 

If you are a junior person in a larger entity, talk to partners/managers about what the paralegals do.  They might already ve occupied or feel that they give partners tasks priority.

> things moving with minimal disruption. One of the biggest pros I’ve seen is flexibility—you can scale hours up or down based on need, and you’re not adding full-time overhead. It’s also useful if you want coverage for things like call handling or intake without pulling your in-office assistant away from case support.

Downside? It can take time to find the *right* VA who understands legal context, and you’ll likely spend a bit more time upfront building process documentation if they’re remote. But once it clicks, it can really ease the load.

Curious if you’re leaning more toward a receptionist-style VA or someone who can also handle backend admin tasks like file management or calendaring?

> If your recruiter can get the firm to agree to the arrangement that you'll take the receptionist job but on the condition that it will only be temporary (and make sure they agree to a set amount of months) and then they'll give you the project assistant role, that's great and you should take it.  Paralegal certificates really don't mean much in the legal world, it is actual hands-on practice experience that is valuable.  You need to get some real legal work experience on your resume and working as a "project assistant" or "legal assistant" is how you start off doing that.  So if the firm will agree to what your recruiter is proposing, that's a good way in.

> not a brag but i do some PI. have a firm that keeps about 20-25 cases. they’re all catastrophic or at least a crazy story, and they’re usually pretty interesting because of the science or story behind it. some products, some employment, even a few auto cases (you’ll always have at least a few even if it’s friends or friends of friends and you’d otherwise pass on it), some business. basically, if i think i can litigate it and make decent money, i’ll do it. i do get brought into trials too, i guess. otherwise this sounds super easy. these cases are discovery intensive, though.

  
anyway. my point with all of this is that there *is* interesting plaintiffs’ work out there if that’s your thing. you just aren’t being exposed to it. i’d pick up all the skills you can in the time you remain at your current job and start polishing off your resume while you look for a boutique type place. you still need at least some of the skills you’re learning now, even if it’s organization, filing, calendaring. 

equally important is to see what these people are doing wrong, and avoid it. do they take too many of certain cases? if their goal is prelit settlement but they find the left turn cases never settle, they should immediately refer them to someone who will file them, right? do they borrow too much? at bad rates? are their computers too old/expensive? do they pay too much for software they never use? is the receptionist fucking stoned and missing calls?

good luck. there are a lot of areas of practice even in P law. what you’re doing now barely requires a law license. it’ll get better when you bounce.

> Thanks for the reply, few things. 

Based off of things I’ve read, it seems like law school admissions office might like to see someone (especially a KJD) have some experience in a law firm. Maybe this is incorrect, but I am exploring because I’d like to strengthen my application. 

The LOR may not help much like you said. However, I’m in a position where I need people that would be willing to write a LOR for me that know me well, or worked closely. I have a few managers from my current company that would write good LOR’s, but perhaps since it’s in an entirely different field (fitness) it may not carry much weight. Academic LOR’s are going to be difficult because I’m mostly online at this point due to balancing school, work, and LSAT. My professors don’t know me personally.

As I am young, my time is certainly my best asset. In this situation, unfortunately it’s not. However, I would be with the firm much longer than 5 months. If I apply this fall for law school, I would not be going to law school until the following year. This gives me potentially over a year of time, and I’d transition to working full-time after I graduate from undergrad / finish apps in the fall. So there is close to 9 months at least there of full-time work.

There’s also the chance that I don’t get the score I want / don’t get into the school I want, and I decide to re-apply the following cycle. 

Given this, would an attorney like you consider me for a paralegal assistant role? Receptionist? I’m charismatic, provide great customer service, eager to learn, and disciplined. Once again, I’m just not sure what roles would even be available for me. I know I’m unqualified for paralegal work as of now.

> You're probably looking for something like a 'Virtual Receptionist' in this case - I run a company that solves this exact problem. Basically you need someone to take calls, set appointments and route calls to appropriate person. I don't know if you have a website, but having a chat pop-up on your site and having someone handle answering those chat leads would massively boost conversion. You have the right thinking, because if those leads are missed (whether online or phone calls) then generally those could be potential clients who could be ringing other law firms. 

Since your firm is practically remote using a virtual receptionist would be a smart move. You can also hire someone but then you have the problem of training, hiring, sick days and attrition, etc. - when you really need people on the phone. Also keep in mind you'll need calls answered after hours if possible.. some services out there have that. Hope that helps.

> Absolutely! A remote law firm is not only possible but becoming more common, especially with the right systems in place. Since you're licensed in multiple jurisdictions, you already have a big advantage—you can serve clients across different regions without needing a physical office.

The biggest challenges tend to be client communication, call management, and maintaining a professional presence. Some solo and small firm attorneys use a mix of AI and live receptionists to handle inbound/outbound calls, chat, and SMS, so they don’t miss potential clients while staying focused on casework. There are even services that provide 24/7 coverage with U.S.-based receptionists who can screen leads, schedule appointments, and follow up—without locking you into long-term contracts.

Curious—what kind of practice are you looking to build? Estate planning, business law, something else?

> I left the public defenders office to join a family law firm and started a criminal defense practice for that family law firm. I later left that firm and joined a larger firm and continued to do criminal defense and family law. I made most of my money from family law, but enjoyed the criminal law practice 1000% more. For years I tried to ditch family law and do more criminal defense work. I was not successful. Partly because I kept taking on big complex family law cases, but partly because I was known as a family law lawyer and that's what people referred my way. 

  
Family law burned me out. I was only able to fully quit it by moving to another jurisdiction and joining a firm doing completely different work. 

  
My family law clients were very needy. They require a lot of staff support. My criminal defense clients were usually not very needy and I barely needed staff to handle them. (Don't get me wrong staff was important, but it was possible to handle my criminal law files without staff if necessary. Family law without staff may be possible for stronger lawyers than I, but I don't recommend it.) 

  
From a financial standpoint, your plan makes sense. From a mental health stand point, I strongly recommend against it. If you expand to family law, you will need a good receptionist and a good paralegal. Someone that can calm the clients down when you aren't available, and someone to work up the files for you while you are in court.  

  
I found that learning family law was not that difficult. That was true in my jurisdiction partly because the judges largely ignored the rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, caselaw, etc. Family law was where the rules meant nothing. The "trials" were not enjoyable like criminal trials. No jury. Usually just the other side, maybe a couple of other small witnesses. Your trial advocacy skills won't get used much. 

  
The hardest part to learn, beyond dealing with the clients, was calculating child support and alimony/maintenance/spousal support. That and learning how to read a tax return. Befriend a CPA and pay them to help you understand a tax return if that isn't something you are familiar with. 

  
But ultimately, don't do it. If you can make a decent living doing criminal defense, you'll be a lot happier.

> Is it court appearances the reason you want an associate?  I ask because I worked for a solo for over 20 years.  After about 5 years, the firm had grown, and I started taking over some of the lighter firm administrative duties, in addition to my lead litigation role.  We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.  My solo did securities litigation and arbitration (me), some personal injury, and elder law.  All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.

My boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.

This allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.

By the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.  We had such a great group of staff working there, so staff issues were minimal.

He also purchased a business condo, which turned out to be a wonderful firm investment. One securities case award was enough to pay it off and then served as an open line of credit if it was needed between awards/settlements.

He still calls me on occasion for advice.  He has his eye on winding down his practice, refers complex litigation to younger attorneys in other firms, and has built a great elder law practice, which keeps him quite comfortable.   He still has the same elder law paralegal.

A word of caution, as a non-attorney who has dealt with lots of other non-attorneys: be careful of the support staffers who are super confident about their approach and make big claims about their abilities. It might seem comforting to have someone like that on your team (heck, they might really BE that good), but they will respect you and your work less than someone less experienced who asks questions, listens to your answers, and strives do things the way you want for your practice. 

Have you considered a virtual receptionist or something explicitly noncommittal, even if just to try out your delegating skills and see how it feels to manage someone else on your cases?  It may give you some additional insights as to what you really need from a permanent assistant.

In addition to the privacy, natural light, and sound damping that folks have already mentioned (which are spot on), we have a good number of litigators, so we added a small moot court room that doubles as an electronic hearing room (the size of a small office). We have more virtual hearings than in-person these days, so this room is at the end of the hall where it’s quiet, has all the videoconferencing equipment set up properly and ready to go, and no distractions in the background.

> We have used Ruby as a reception service since we opened 14 years ago. It is a fabulous service and allows the attorney and staff to get their work done & return phone calls when convenient. We have trained the Ruby Receptionists to politely answer and screen calls, ring the appropriate employee to share basic caller info, and most of the time, we have the receptionist take a message and return the call later. Not taking calls or being interpreted makes our very small firm extremely productive and gives off a very professional appearance to callers. All calls are returned within a day and most returned the same day before 5 pm. Obviously calls from the courthouse, a Judge's office, or our bank are taken immediately. (We also only conduct busines calls and emails during work hours except if it's a emergency.)

> Slightly different opinion than most.  If you want to go LLM route, work part time as a clerical for a small firm while you're doing it.  My receptionist had a degree from Poland and she was by far overqualified and the best admin I've ever had.  When she wanted to go back to school for her LLM so she could practice law, I suggested she work part time for me because I didn't want to lose her.  I then offered her a first year position, and she's coming back in September after she sits for the bar.  If you show your skills and intelligence while getting the degree, a pathway to a job may be easier.  But I am a small office of 2.  I bet 8 years into your career though most employers wont care that much if you have an LLM or a JD if you're looking for a new position with experience.

> Hello there! Glad you reached out!

As I am not in the UK, I can't exactly speak on their terms of employment requirements. Also, I am not in a position to comment on qualifications without knowing your work history or education. I personally took a short administration course through a local college to get a certificate before I got my first reception job in a law firm. This course was just a basic admin course not specified for law, but it was enough to get my foot in the door.

My first office was a small, slow firm, 4 lawyers, 2 paralegals.   This helped me learn at a slower pace and it truly helped me along the way. I always recommend trying to get into a small firm for those who are wanting to get into a law admin position.

Maybe in your resume and/or cover letter, point out the skills you have that would benefit the role of a receptionist. Can you answer the phone with proper etiquette? Do you have any previous work experience where you had to deal with confidential information or emotionally charged clientele? Can you respond to emails in a timely and professional manner? How organized are you? Do you have customer-service experience? These are all super basic, but majorly important skills to have as a receptionist. 

Getting yourself into a position like a law receptionist or admin is a fantastic way to get in and see if this career is right for you without spending the time, money, and effort into going to law school. If you find yourself an opportunity to work in a law firm, really take everything in. Ask questions to better your knowledge. Read through documents during any down time. Help out fellow co-workers and lawyers. Join law admin groups on Facebook or Reddit as well for tips and tricks.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions. I'm always here to help!

If it's not a closed door, it's pretty normal for someone to interrupt (regardless of "rank") with a quick question/update. I'm surprised the seniors haven't reacted already if she's out of line.

The four "senior" attorneys each have their own paralegals, whom they each pay individually, while us three junior attorneys do not have any support staff. Our receptionist completes basic tasks for everyone in the firm, like taking phone messages and putting postage on envelopes, but other than that we're each on our own. 

I actually pay one of the senior attorney's paralegals on the side (with permission) to draft stuff for me as needed. I'm in an awkward position where I'm not bringing in enough to hire my own full-time assistant yet, but I'm getting more work than what I can manage on my own. This arrangement works for now. But do I wish that our firm had legal assistants that were available to everyone? Yes. 

I'd like to hear from others how common this arrangement is, though. My friend is an associate at a medium-sized firm and thinks it's outrageous that I pay out of pocket for an assistant. He says that's something the firm ought to cover for associates, like Lexis and Clio (both of which I also pay out of pocket for). Everyone at my firm acts like it's totally normal, though, so I really don't know if this is the "done" thing?

Some approaches we see working well: Using Virtual receptionists (especially ones trained in legal protocols) to answer and triage calls during gaps or after hours, Scheduled call forwarding for known court days or off-hours, Automated appointment booking + call-back systems for non-urgent inquiries.

Full disclosure: at AnswerConnect, we work with law firms to provide live, professional call coverage so lawyers can focus on billable work and urgent matters aren’t missed. Many small practices use this as a supplement to in-house staff rather than a replacement.

On the call screening topic, two things come to mind:

1. Google Voice (Free)
It prompts the caller to “state your name and Google Voice will try to connect you.” You can keep that feature on or off, but it helps filter unknown numbers. Sure, people can game it by just saying their name, but tone usually gives them away.

2. Virtual receptionist (Paid)
If you’re getting a ton of calls, there are services that answer for you and follow a script. They’ll email you something like:
	•	Name: John Doe
	•	Reason for call: [explanation]
	•	Seeking representation: Yes/No
	•	Call back: [number]

I’m sure there’s an AI tool that does this too — give me a sec and I’ll try to find

> My experience is that most commercial "calling" apps, like facebook, signal, whatsapp, teams, zoom, jitisi etc. etc.

are all vastly superior to running some random SIP client on your phone, in terms of handling WiFi <-> LTE handoff, and also dealing with packet loss or bad connections.  Trouble is most of these are not "phone" services with DIDs used to dial the PSTN.

Still waiting for a good answer on this in terms of something that works with the PSTN and isn't some expensive per-seat commercial solution (like zoom phone or ringcentral).

in my tests 3CX client with opus was certainly better than , "some random SIP client", but still probably not as good as other solutions.

I did jitsi test with someone who had a bad 4G connection and it was able to do better than even whatsapp/FB calling, so there are different tiers and incremental improvements to Forward error correction being made over time that \*some\* companies implement, although they are controversial and not often default. Opus 1.5 was released for example with something they call "deep redundancy" which should maintain call quality even with massive packet loss, but it is not implemented yet by anything iirc.

personally I find it sad that there isn't some easily solution , I went down a rabbit hole of WEBRTC clients that connect to some PBXs , supposedly that's a half-decent solution. Still , many of the apps seem to be at a "hobbyist" level of maturity.

At some point I want to test out these "WebRTC" bridges that claim to allow you to connect a smartphone to the PBX and then the PBX handles the SIP outside of the first leg (thus your phone is not subject to packet loss errors or WAN connection changes, and benefits from FEC & other features)

rant:  
It's unfortunate I sometimes get made of by network admins on reddit or IRC for not using the right language or acronyms when discussing this stuff. They get very defensive "you don't understand what SIP is, etc" and we get into a semantic discussions or questioning my skillset rather than an honest  discussion of the status quo , potential hacks, and new innovations coming down the pipe

And since the Twilio sub likely won't let me critical post through... I'll post it the fuck here:

I've heard from a friend in Big Tech and now I'm experiencing it... "they're dicey", this pm told me.

I'm writing a fairly simple aliasing extension and wanted people to have a cheaper alternative to Burner for phone aliasing. I do three tests and then get a message that I MUST upgrade. As soon as I do that... Twilio slaps me with an error that I'm not allowed to create numbers anymore with an error 22300 "This account is restricted from provisioning new long code phone numbers". Literally that same instant, there wasn't even a semblance of service rendered.

I find out I have to email some verify@ email to get this block lifted, so I do that explaining my case, as requested in their link: This account is restricted from provisioning new long code phone numbers. I get an email today that they think I'm fraud, asking for everything from website addresses to several details about my credit card. Fucking EXCUSE ME?! In the original email I wrote to verify@ (which clearly they didn't even read), most of those questions were answered.

There was NO MENTION of the refund I requested in that original email i wrote to them either. I just did the closing process but based on the fact these guys are saying I'm a fraud since my username differs from my legal name (and they'll probably lose their absolute minds when they find out I have a preferred name at work), I'm guessing I won't even receive my refund they claim they return after closing... So I'm ready to call my credit company and they can find out then just how fucking real my payment details are.

I plan to tell every Tom, Dick, and Harry developer I meet to stay tf away the same way my big tech buddy tried to warn me. I'm damn sure there are alternatives and I'm going with that; the only reason I went with Twilio is cos the AI agents all said it was the best way... their competitors simply need better AI-SEO. Anyone brings this company up to me, I'll be like "well, if you enjoy paying someone to be called a con artist without any fucking basis other than your username and legal name are entirely different... like regular people oft do... then this is not the place for you."

The tool allows me to generate test calls (100s of them if needed) for the projects I am working on. This helps me to validate that we can handle the calls we believe we should be able to handle. 

In the last few years I ported this tool over to Python and added the ability to call a range of phone numbers and give you a status of what actually answered and to transcribe calls in order to validate what callers hear matches what you expected. My tool has only ever ran from my local computer and I am debating putting it online if something like it already exists. I am looking for something that is easy to work with and pretty much pay as you go that has these capabilities. Anyone know of one?

To recap I am looking for:
* Ability to place a consistent number of calls to a specific number. (Load testing)
* Ability to put in a range of phone numbers and provide a report of the outcome of those calls. Fax, no answer, error, human, etc.
* Ability to navigate an IVR and transcribe what is being heard.

They really couldn't help. All they can see on their end is that the call shows as "not answered." When they tested making calls, they just got a single ringback and then a busy tone, same as I get.

I've tried forwarding to several different numbers. Results are...odd:

- My personal AT&T cell phone: fails

- My Google Voice number: fails

- The third-party service we're ultimately trying to forward calls to: fails

- A test phone number operated by [TestCall.com](http://TestCall.com) (804-222-1111): SUCCEEDS

- The Alaska Airlines main reservations line (800-252-7522): fails

- 3 other test numbers I found in this Reddit thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/911r3p/what\_number\_to\_make\_a\_test\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/911r3p/what_number_to_make_a_test_call/)

- 248-434-5508 and 909-390-0003: fails

- 925-259-0082 (echo test): SUCCEEDS

So the only two that work are explicit test numbers. The rest all fail.

The only thing the [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) support folks could come up with was either agreeing with me that it might be some kind of SHAKEN/STIR failure, or the receiving providers block calls from VoIP providers.

The only other thing I can think of is maybe more termination providers these days are set up to block calls that spoof Caller ID that belongs to a different carrier than the originating carrier? Except these calls also all fail when I just override the outbound caller ID with my [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) DID.

I guess I can bail on [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) and try another service, though VoIP.ms's hosted IVR is by far the cheapest solution for the very simple need we have ("If this is an emergency, press 1 to be connected to our after-hours support line").

> I'm testing both. I was trying other systems as well. I have so much to do and too little time to get an answer.

Asking too many questions will get me too much information in a short amount of time. Each answer is a lead I can follow. I learn fast but I hate learning, so people answering my questions provides me with specific information I need to start.

Anyway, I'm Palestinian but my company is Israeli and work in Israel. So I have a few options for SIP Trunk providers. I just need to configure my PBX to use the correct service. One provider is actually a reseller for 3CX. I'll contact them after the holidays to check if I can get a better price from them than the price I have from 3CX themselves.

Thank yoy for the information!

> Yeah - using your current handset is going to depend on the model of handset you have... More than likely the answer is no, but there are ways to do it.

One way might be something like a Citel TVA (or similar device) instead of individual ATA's.  They utilize the digital or analog lines to your current handsets and connect to a VOIP service. 

Lots of VOIP providers will bundle handsets with a contract.  Some considerations: are there existing Ethernet connections at the location of the handsets? If there is at least one there you can use the new handset as a pass through. If not, you will either need to run new wiring or ensure that the new handsets have built in wifi, and that the current wifi coverage has enough coverage and bandwidth. Most will also do some bandwidth testing to make sure that your network is ready for the service. 

With the dial plan you are talking about some providers will charge extra for the hunt groups and features. Just review the plans thoroughly before making a commitment. 

I work for a company that used to rep Panasonic and still has to support it for our clients.  I have preferences in the Voip market but certainly wouldn't push you in any specific direction.

> No worries. and Thank You for the compliments.

On the main page (before logging in) click on the Home icon. In the middle of the page you will see the ability to verify if a Number is eligible to be ported into CC. There is no charge to port in a number from other providers. Once you run the check, you can begin the process by logging in. Keep in mind a few things.You MUST select your Calling Plans at the very start of the LNP process. You may still change later if needed. CC does not discount for partial months.

Make sure you have the account PIN code for your old provider so they can release the Number. Do NOT cancel your old account until the number has been fully tested after the Port. CC is pretty good about giving you a status along the way. 

The new number can then be assigned a function under the Extensions tab (next to Dashboard). Here you configure what you wish to use each number for:  Answering a call on your home phone, using as a Fax number (sent to your Email), VoiceMail only, registered as a SIP service with an App for taking/making calls on your mobile phone, etc. The Zoiper app works well with CC for this purpose.

Keep going! Best of luck.

> You are asking about the Caller Name. What Number is shown on your display? You should still see your calling number as the incoming caller. Have you tested this with other friends and their phones? What anyone is able to see for CNAM is controlled by the phone service they are answering incoming calls from.

If they choose not to look in one of several databases (think phone books) that MAY have a name linked to the calling number, they can say it is coming from Unknown, Spam, Private or whatever. If you lock that number in your local Contacts and list it under SANTA that is what will show up everytime you call yourself from THAT number on THAT phone.

> Well there is a whole discipline of enterprise architecture whose job it is to figure these things out: ask the right technical questions, analyse the answers, ask follow ups, ask for evidence of appropriate security standards (ISO etc), run tests, etc. This is then added into contracts. Any law firm dabbling in this stuff without a robust architecture and procurement setup is asking for trouble, though in practice there is something of a free rider effect on offer given all the other law firms that have these things worked out. It’s the same way they get comfortable with cloud document storage or Microsoft Exchange for your emails, etc.

So yes I suppose it’s possible that Harvey are saying there’s no model building with customer data, are providing a bunch of fake evidence of that, are misrepresenting in all of their contracts with law firms and none of their customers has figured this out. I suppose it’s possible that OpenAI are doing likewise with respect to Harvey. 

It would be game over overnight for Harvey if this were discovered (and it’s hard to see how it wouldn’t be). And given their game is either supporting as many professional service firms as they can or, if you’re right, taking their business, trust is probably more important than incremental improvements to their model.

> AI-powered SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is changing how customers find brands, evaluate options, and make purchases online. Here’s why AI SEO works so well:



AI SEO allows marketing teams to analyze large datasets about customer intent, search habits, and preferences. With machine learning algorithms, websites can be optimized for relevant content and keywords that resonate with individual users. This means that search results and on-site experiences are more tailored. Customers can easily find exactly what they need, which speeds up their decision-making.

Advanced Understanding of User Intent  

Traditional SEO often relies on fixed keyword matching. AI SEO takes it further by mimicking human understanding of queries and context. Natural language processing (NLP) helps search engines grasp nuanced questions, product needs, and pain points. This leads to a smoother and more logical user journey.

Real-Time Adaptation  

AI SEO tools constantly monitor changes in search algorithms and user behavior. They adjust strategies automatically. This can include updating content, optimizing for featured snippets, or enhancing technical SEO without needing manual changes. Customers see fresher, more relevant results, which builds brand trust.

Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)  

As customers increasingly use voice assistants, chatbots, and direct answers instead of traditional search results, AI SEO makes sure brands are easy to find in these new answer-first environments. If a consumer asks, “What’s the best wireless earbud for running?”, AI-powered sites that give relevant answers stand out and heavily influence decisions.

Predictive Analysis and Content Recommendation  

AI systems can forecast popular queries, seasonal trends, and changing market needs, ensuring brands stay ahead. They present the right content before customers even know what they want, making purchasing decisions easier.

Conversion Optimization  

AI SEO doesn’t just attract traffic; it also focuses on converting visitors. Algorithms test headlines, calls-to-action, landing page designs, and product placements to find what persuades visitors most effectively. This ongoing optimization greatly increases the chances of customer action.

Trust and Credibility  

AI SEO highlights authentic, trustworthy, and highly relevant information. For customers, this reduces uncertainty, simplifies comparisons, and builds confidence in selecting a solution or service.

> Part of the problem is that your are pigeon holed into “website”. When people think of you they think about a transactional engagement. I want a website and you give me a website. In reality, your customers have problems and the website can be the answer to those problems if positioned right.

For instance, why do people want websites? Probably to drive growth. Is the website driving growth? If not, what could you potentially do to help with this? You mention SEO which is a start but maybe you offer CRO services with things like
Monthly A/B tests?

Sell a solution to a problem rather than a tool. That’s the key to get MRR going. People need a website once every so often but they always need more business so try and anchor your business somehow to that and you’ll be shocked how fast the MRR adds up.

> I have been running a YouTube marketing agency for great brands for the last 8 years. Our mission is to be the best YouTube Marketing agency in the world. We provide YouTube Strategy, Packaging (Thumbnail/Title), Optimization/SEO, and Advertising.   
  
It has not been easy, but we have been fortunate to work with 200+ businesses, including some of the biggest companies in the world. If i were to start over, I would just focus on one specific area of offering as you're suggesting (Script Writing), or one specific type of audience. Each service offering ie Thumbnail Split testing, requires it's own SOPs/Processes, and specialists. That adds up when you consider the complexity of doing YouTube really well.  

We have hired multiple email outreach agencies, to try to generate leads, but found it to be spammy, and not as effective as our other channels. In that time, I think the game has gotten even harder to do it at scale. But here are the 3 most important things we learned for cold outreach: 

* Lead with a great offer, ideally one that's hard to refuse.    
* Have a couple Case Study references that are very specific to the ICP (Ideal Client Profile) you're going after.
* Avoid the spam filter, by warming up emails, doing proper DMARC setups, and caps on how many emails you send per day/ per email. 

The other sources we have been able to generate leads from include SEO, Google Ads, AI Queries, and Listicles recommending us as best YouTube Marketing agency. 

While we have grown to 7+ figures, we have grown and invested in our team and tools proportionally, so we don't have great margins. Happy to answer any questions.

> I think you will get the best solution here.  Im 24/7 testing strategies and getting clients without any kind of cold outreach. I answered  a lot of questions here and many other subs you can read. I run a white label SEO agency btw. But here I will just explain my stratgey and what I exactly do, so you can follow that.   


Just creating post on linkedin isnt a good idea. Linkedin has a lot of potential customers but its a little hard to find clients there compared to the other social networks. Because everyone tyring to find clients from linkedin, so it makes it compettive.     


Here's the steps exactly  you have to follow:    


1. Find some groups on facebook. If there's no exact groups that you're offering service for no worries, just imagine whats othe related groups that your ideal clients can hangout. Maybe gohighlevel group, because thats an agency group. Think like that.   Go connect only only with the profiles that matches your clients persona  

2. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing energy in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your energy on it.   
random prolfiles arent the solution specially when you're struggling.  So, it should be specific and direct.   

3. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing enery in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your enery on it.   

4. Now lets tak about the content. Its very important.Always save energy to put on somehting that works.  Now its AI generation, so use it.  Ask AI to create some topics that can trigger your ideal clients or attract them. Then the AI (Bard or GPT) will give you a bunch of catchy lines that you can use as headline. It really can attract because AI know the human psychology it has a lot of data. Then choose the best topics and craft your content.  Try to make them shorted instead of bigger version. But dont create too many contents,  try to create minimum and engage them first.   

5. Engagements:   Comment on other people posts, and groups.  Its more imprtant than your post. You can create one post weekly, but you should comment every day, even as many as you can.  For facebook groups,  find the best engaging posts and for linkedin find the thought leaders in your industry. Then go comment on thheir post. Any comment you add should be trigger people, so they reply you. start conversation, and this is how you get attention and over the time you you will potential clients.   


I think its enough for today to explain what I do to get most of my clients though. And it works 100000% because im doing almost same thing and scaling my agency better than any previous period.

> Gil made some really great points and he’s speaking from a more experienced POV. You mentioned a few points that I also want to add to having opened my own digital agency as apposed to SMMA. 

- The problem with just being a middle man is the inability to scale, problem solve and troubleshoot. You’re basically selling “shallow” service of posting on social rather than marking a brand on social media. There is way more marketing making then just being present on socials. It’s about shaping consumer behavior and analyzing performance to keep clients. There are tactics and strategies at play and trusting freelancers to keep your agency afloat is not the best move since they won’t care about your clients it company as much as you. What if they leave you high and dry. Not to mention client facing meeting where you might cover reporting and explains performance and next steps etc. You’ll need to have knowledge about the service you are offering. You’re still in high school take the time to intern for example and gain experience first before offering a service to companies via a freelancer. 

- Even if you feel like you don’t need to differentiate yourself… you definitely need to. Prospects usually shop around before they sign any contracts. They probably talk to 10 other agencies before deciding and if you’re not making a great impression and impressing them with you knowledge and what you can do for them then you can’t get clients and eventually scale and be able to charge more. And if they have questions that you can’t answer because if your lack of knowledge then you can’t build trust. 

- YouTube is a great way to learn strategies but again you won’t know if they work unless you test them and adjust to what works for you. Take everything with a grain of salt. A better option is to get certification from meta or other platforms that other them. This also build credibility with clients and peers. 

- Don’t go into social media if you don’t or can’t see the point in learning the skill. Freelancers come in all shapes and forms… usually in the marketing industry it’s more reputable to be part of an agency. I can’t say the same for graphic doesn’t for example. 

But again we are just offering advice having been through it. Good luck.

I also second that this brings in low quality clients. We all start somewhere though. You gotta deal with the bottom of the barrel as a noob. 

If someone offers me free or overly cheap services, alarm bells go off. I don't want free, I want high performing with a fair price. Free is not a selling point to real businesses. 

Forget the dinner. Nobody cares. 

Instead of focusing so hard on the offer, focus on some x-factor that makes you different. "I discovered this one thing that most media buyers don't know about" etc. 

Good luck! Come back and let us know how it goes.

> I took FMLA for depression when I worked in professional services. My manager, who was the main reason I could not take it anymore, asked me why I was taking leave and my answer was “my doctor recommended I take this time to focus on my health.” This manager unfortunately took over the communication plan, told me not to tell anyone I was taking FMLA. I have no idea what they told who. 

My time off gave me the necessary space and distance to work on myself and realize that the environment was detrimental to the point of being dangerous for my health. The SSRIs did their work, I found pleasure in my hobbies and started rebuilding a life outside of work. I also focused on figuring out an exit strategy. Having that more formalized when I got back to work made me feel far less anxious. 

The truth is you don’t know how people will react to your LOA. Some people will be idiots. Some people won’t care. Some people might take it as inspiration and take their own leave (I took leave because a friend did it and I saw how their life changed). But you have control over how you take care of yourself with the tools and resources at your disposal. So use them.

"Older guy who wants to tell war stories" made me laugh out loud, I KNOW "that" guy. 😅😅

>yea, some of those folks are pricks. But also, you are discussing a competing idea and probably a bit naive in your own way (not bad, just you don't know what you don't know having not been on that side of the table

You are very correct in your assessment of naivete. I did have many of those conversations fairly early in my career and I really had extremely limited understanding of their world. I've worked very hard to improve on that aspect, but it has been admittedly challenging trying to look into the kitchen from outside the house.

Some key takeaways from what you said that I am very happy to have you confirm are:

1. SMEs are an untapped market because they are extremely hard to convert (Found out in practice)
2. You need to package everything you do and frame it as a clear "product" or "service"  (I struggle greatly with this)
3. Tons of success happens in silence, away from the spotlights
4. To say that networking is key would be an understatement

In a nutshell, these 4 things that you highlight are essential, and happen to be some of the things I struggle most with, so my limited success should be no surprise at all.

Looking at the advice someone else gave, I have also started down the path of getting a very specific specialization (M365 and Azure for business intelligence, AI, process improvement, automation), in the hopes that it would open doors for me to address some of those issues. For example, being able to brand myself as an implementation partner, a specialist with clear deliverables, being able to set price relative to truly comparable offerings, and having the opportunity to speak/present at events on topics that "pull in" people by interests to kickstart networking.

I really gotta figure out how to get better at these things ASAP. 

Thanks again!

> I am so sorry about your Mom’s diagnosis.

My Dad recently had a heart attack and had to be resuscitated outside the hospital, followed by time in the cardiac ICU, double bypass surgery, and cardiac rehab. I had to tell my boss because I basically disappeared for a week, and then had to figure out care after the hospital. But I think being proactive with HR and your boss is the way to go. If it is financially/policy possible for you, consider going part time, or getting a formal accommodation to work less as needed for appointments. 

There was a great answer above and I agree with @stumbling_coherently’s comment. A couple things to add, the emotional stress of making decisions and coping with news and my parents’ emotions took a physical toll on me. I had several days where I felt like I had the flu, with achy joints and headaches that I think were from clenching my entire body for hours at a time. Please make sure to book in time for yourself to rest and take care of yourself.

Ask your Mom’s hospital if they have a social worker to connect her and you to services that can help. I signed my parents up for meals on wheels for the duration of cardiac rehab. It gave me peace of mind knowing someone was physically checking on them mid day and that they would have at least one balanced meal a day that I didn’t have to cook. If your Mom qualifies, you would qualify as a caregiver.

As for informing work, start with HR, with an email so that it is in writing and you don’t have to deal face to face on an emotional topic. I’d ask:

1) Is it possible to add a dependent parent onto our health insurance plan?
2) What are the policies and procedures for temporary accommodations for caring for a family illness?
3) Am I eligible for FMLA (family and medical leave act) leave?

I put the last one on there because I was not, which made everything murkier, but if you’re full time, at a firm >50 people, and have been there a year, you are.


That way you can approach you boss with a plan. There is a lot of uncertainty, but you can start with planning the next month and set up a time to reassess and plan from there.

Again, I am sorry about your Mom’s illness, I hope her treatment goes well, and please take care of yourself too.

I don't have a recommendation for a provider, but my only word of caution would be that while a service can lighten your non billable load, it can also carry a price. A lot of legal shoppers want quick comfort or answers and will more often than not stick with the first lawyer they can connect to on the phone. If using a service, build strict protocols for how quickly to book a meeting, or rules around immediately tagging you in on certain types of  matters so you can build that relationship first.

> I’d say the biggest thing to remember with small firm websites is that you don’t need something flashy, but you do need something professional, easy to update, and built with SEO in mind from the start. A clean site with strong attorney bios, practice areas, and a simple blog/news section can go a long way.

A few lessons I’ve seen firms learn the hard way:

* **Avoid “locked down” platforms** like FindLaw or other pay-to-play services. They tend to overcharge, underdeliver, and make it hard to update your own content.
* **Wix and Squarespace** are fine for DIY, but they usually hit a ceiling if you want to grow traffic, run SEO, or make the site look truly polished.
* **WordPress** is the standard for law firms. It gives you total control, is SEO-friendly, and lets you easily post updates or articles without needing a middleman.
* **SEO matters more than you think.** Even if referrals drive most of your work, a well-optimized site helps establish credibility and can bring in co-counsel or higher-value cases you might not have expected.

I work with law firms on web design and marketing, and what I usually recommend is: start with a clean, conversion-focused WordPress site that reflects your brand and is easy to manage. Then you can layer on SEO or paid ads later if you want more traffic — but you’ll already have a solid foundation.

> Here are my suggestions with some reasons.

Use WealthCounsel or one of its competitors, because rolling your own practice specific tools from scratch in a new practice area just makes no sense. Then, pick the rest of your technology to serve WC or other choice. That will make your life easier.

Get at least one gigabyte upload and download Internet fiber at business grade, which is particularly important if you sync your files to the cloud. One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.

For bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.

Consider having an answering service to present a "bigger" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.

For hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:

Printer with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.

Sheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.

Get a flatbed scanner if you need it.

Get fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.

Get a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.

Get a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.

Software oriented tools:

Please read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)

Notice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the à la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.

Of course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.

You need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with

> Assuming this is not a contingency firm 

1.  Knowing what you’re going to sell (creating solid offers people can’t say no to and will give you the money up front in advance)

2.  Deciding what you’re not going to sell (to prevent you from taking whatever that comes in the door; blowing up your processes and systems)

3. Determining who you’re gonna sell to (there are people/personalities more likely to buy from you.  Target them with marketing (eg attending events, social media posts, placing ads, etc)

4. Figure out how many offers you gotta sell each month to break even each month.  

I recommend Clio suite, malpractice insurance, biz insurance, a virtual practice model (if your practice area allows), a bank with low or no monthly fees, quickbooks, and a one page website that tells who you are, how you can help, with an intake form (Clio Grow) and phone number to an answering service integrated with Clio Grow (or depending on practice area and business model, a phone number with an automatic greeting that new client intake is done online only via intake form).  

Then spend real time marketing.  Get out there on foot, online and establish yourself as the go to person for whatever you’re selling.

> First, you're likely not going to be working for the VC firm AND the companies they invest in, that's a HUGE conflict of interest so I would get some clarity on that.

I used to work in a boutique firm that handled mainly VC financing (on the startup company side) but also did other general lawyer stuff for these startups. To answer your questions directly:

1. You need general transactional experience but mainly finance. Sure there are books out there but you do have to live it as there a lot of moving parts. I can't imagine someone being able to draft and negotiate the finance docs (look at [https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/](https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/) to see what is involved in a single round of financing) for a seed round without seeing it done a few times and being able to dip your toe in here and there. Depending on the startup, there could be a number of different types of contracts that you would need to know your way around (organizational docs, manufacturing agreements, SaaS agreements, indemnification agreements, confidentiality agreements,  and other various service and partnership agreements). Unfortunately your current experience does not translate well (just as I wouldn't know the first thing about criminal or family law, or litigation for that matter).
2. Two books I would recommend to get started in this world are Venture Deals by Brad Feld and A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting, Fifth Edition by Ken Adams.
3. It is workable as a solo but you would likely need some support staff like a paralegal or two. Lot's of docs to draft and process and lots of redlines going back and forth during negotiations.

While possibly less stressful than family and criminal law, it definitely has it's own set of headaches. Tight deadlines, long hours, demanding clients and opposing counsels, and lots of fire drills due to inexperienced and unorganized executives. Responses to emails are expected in minutes and you are absolutely expected to be a master to the point where you have the law and processes memorized ("give me a day to research that for you" does not cut it). These are startups that are hiring you for your expertise to help them navigate the law and don't have time for your inexperience so they will absolutely leave you for someone else that seemingly knows more and responds faster.

Happy to chat more if you have any other questions.

- You might start working on the firm's Google Business Profile for lead gen (you can rank in the local map pack for mobile searches)

> In my opinion, as a consumer/referral source rather than someone advertising my own services, I would say Free social media and web content is a good investment of your time as you’re starting out.  My family and friends often ask me who I would recommend as a lawyer for whatever their problem is. I’m a sub-specialist, not a general practice lawyer, and their problem will never be my niche area of law. I can’t help them myself, but I still do some research and try to answer their legal questions without giving specific advice. Most of the time, I can find a good answer about what the law says in blogs on a law firm’s website, and one firm usually ends up having lots of good info. When I answer the person’s questions, I send links to the articles or blog posts I find and tell them this firm sounds credible, so call them for help. Works for video content I see on linked in, too. You can build trust with people you never met that way. Lots of lawyers need the services you’re selling, and we always get asked for estate planning referrals. If you can show lawyers that you know what you’re talking about, you could get them as clients as well as referral sources, without even knowing them.

ETA: if you provide enough info that a smart person could answer an easy question without contacting you, then you’ll invite the smart person with a hard question— i.e., the higher paying clients—to contact you.

> "***This app version can’t complete a security check"***

My Pixel 9 Pro came stock with a Google VPN - apparently I inadvertently enabled it.  Come to find out, Talkatone doesn't play well with VPNs and they'll shut you down if they even suspect that you're using one. Once the VPN was disabled again, Talkatone began working okay and after two days, eventually logged me back in.

In the 10+ years I've been a customer, Talkatone has implemented ***"fair use  limits".*** For as many times as I have inquired, **they continue to refuse to tell me what those limits are.** And, without knowing what those limits are, it makes it very difficult to play by the rules.

I've experienced delayed texts, texts not received and incoming calls that do not ring through but go straight to voicemail. I've experienced a malfunctioning with the app's "answer" button making it impossible to answer a call.  I have a good amount of paid credits but even those don't offer immunity from the ineptitude I've experienced with this service lately.  Talkatone is no longer reliable. I cannot recommend using it as one's main number.

> A few notes: can't make any big changes to the system, can't change provider, and can't spend too much money.

We currently use RingCentral for VOIP. Regular cheap Vtech cordless phone system with one answering machine. We've been dealing with a lot of echo and feedback on calls, or calls just not coming through, and I thought it was the internet service. However, we recently upgraded and have 800/500 service but the echoing is still there and I'm thinking it's the phones themselves.

Lf recommendations on a phone system - one answering machine/two cordless handsets - that are compatible with VOIP and might get rid of the echo and feedback and which are not wifi based - they need to plug into the line the way it's already setup. Need something I can pickup at OfficeMax or order on Amazon. Or, what should I be looking for in the specs?

> That's rough, I'd be annoyed too.  
  
A "SIP client" is basically just an app your mobile phone uses to connect to your VoIP, and it sounds like the one you're using isn't working. It's not uncommon for providers to have their own branded softphone, but if that's the case, you could also consider using a third-party softphone like Bria. It works with most VoIP providers and might solve your issue.  
  
The best next step would be to contact your VoIP provider's support team. They should be able to help you with the correct SIP configuration settings or recommend a specific app that they know works well with their service if they don't offer a native one. If they can't, then it's probably time to explore other options.  
  
I work in the industry and am happy to try and answer more specific questions, if you have any.

> We aren’t allowed to recommend specific service providers but, in general….

Almost any hosted voice service will be able to do what you need.  You want to look for the following when shopping:

1.  Call groups
2.  A smartphone app
3.  Voicemail to email (bonus if they include transcription for no extra charge).

You’ll port or move your number to the new provider.

Set up a call group which will include all four of you.

set the group up to ring the main person who answers most of the calls and then after a number of rings can ring either all the other numbers in the call group or can ring the other phones one at a time.

If no answer from any of the phones, send the call to voicemail.

Set up a group email address that includes all four of you.  Set the phone system to send voicemails to this email address.

All four of you will get an email that has the voicemail attached.

Return the call 🙂

It’ll take a bit to get used to and you might have to play around with the group setup to have a balance between how many rings ou think a caller would tolerate before sending the call to voicemail.

Bonus - some of these services support texting to the same phone number so you could offer a caller with the option to send a text instead of a voicemail.

> No no. Not referring to you in particular, sorry if it seemed that way. Just a comment about the many ways people try to get around the rules, thinking we won't notice.

If someone asks for a product, refer them to the monthly requests thread. There you are more than welcome to say "Yes I use XYZ and find it works well".

I know it's clunky, and it would certainly be more convenient to just drop a review whenever someone asks. Unfortunately when we've tried that in the past, it becomes unreasonably time-consuming to sift through all the "reviews" and other recommendations to see which are legitimate. At that point the sub degenerates into a competition of who can drop a comment the fastest to promote their product, without even answering the original question.

The goal here, really, is to make sure no newbies get taken advantage of by vultures looking to make a quick buck. Someone trying to set up a home VoIP line gets bombarded by ads from companies who will happily take their money but don't actually do what the OP needs them to do. As someone with no experience, it can be hard to figure things like that out.

That's why the sub has the monthly thread. Out here someone can ask specific questions like "I'm considering XYZ for my home VoIP setup. Can they do ABC?" and the replies will be "Yes they can" or "No they can't". We leave no room for "No, but you try our service EFG instead!"

If someone *wants* to be advertised to, they can go to a specific thread that doesn't interfere with the rest of the sub.

Again, I know it's not ideal overall, but please trust us when we say this is the best solution we could come up with. You would probably agree if you could see the shit that the mod queue fills up with.

For context, we're a small non-profit. We mostly use phone calls for communication, but our main line can also be texted, which functions as a crisis hotline for current or new clients. We have had so so so many issues with OneTalk dropping calls, not loading texts, failing to sync up between devices, connectivity issues of all kinds... over it. And the customer service stinks.

Currently, we have 5 team members with cell phones (each has the OneTalk user app) plus one desk phone. All through Verizon. Not married to these devices or service plan.

Looking for VoIP recommendations that satisfy these needs:

1. Central line that rings on at least 6 phones (whether simultaneously or when not answered by another employee)
2. Text feature is a must. Our current OneTalk number can be texted or called.

Bonus features:

1. Would be dreamy if program could be accessed on a Mac or PC as well (even just the text feature)
2. Has an option to build a virtual receptionist/touch-tone menu/similar

> Do not promote or advertise for any business, service or product unless responding to a request in the designated monthly requests post. This includes recommending a user change providers when they have not indicated they are interested in doing so.
This rule does not apply to requests or recommendations for hardware. Recommendations for hardware that is locked to a particular service or provider must include a clear disclaimer of the closed ecosystem (e.g. Ooma, firmware-locked Cisco phones).

> This rule does not apply to requests or recommendations for hardware. Recommendations for hardware that is locked to a particular service or provider must include a clear disclaimer of the closed ecosystem (e.g. Ooma, firmware-locked Cisco phones).

I don't know if this is me reading too much into the rule, but shouldn't an exception also be extended to software where the mechanism of the software itself is the focus?

Lets say I wish to discuss a VOIP application where the name of a company is somewhat embedded in nature of the application.

For arguments sake, lets say I hypothetically wish to discuss game based VOIP clients and their protocols, it's fairly impossible for me to not to mention "TeamSpeak" or "Discord", the companies offering the software.

Also, if someone was to discuss softphones, under the current rules if someone was to ask "Which softphone offers BLF capability?" and you answered "Zoiper does that", have you not just run foul of rule 1 in its current form?

I do believe an exception needs to be made for software discussion and recommendations when the capability and principality of the software is at the heart of the issue.

If you have virtualization environment, UPS and redundant internet on premise, that's different.

And obviously, a self serve PBX is so that you have more control over your choice of provider, and can make any changes you like when you want love you get the gist of how it works.

Now, an open source PBX like FreePBX and Fuzion PBX is great. FreePBX is easy, but also one of the most hacked platform in the world.

But if you need reliable service, it's best to depend on a commercial support like those provided by partners of softwares like 3CX and Yeastar

My recommendation stands, get a provider that can offer support for that DIY PBX of your choice and get help when you need it. If their support is good, then the service will be as well.

While not always definitive or exhaustive of your options, this list will give you a better chance of taking advantage of all integrations that exist between your PM software and the PBX you choose.

Next, you will probably be paying per user/device as that's the business model of most VoIP providers.  You can shop around, but I'd really recommend finding a trusted and preferably local resource to guide you.

Lastly, faxing is very much offered by VoIP companies, in different capacities.  If you have and need a physical fax machine you'll need to get an analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) that will let the fax machine send and receive via the VoIP service.  Your VoIP vendor will be able to answer questions and help.

> How are you typically getting paid? Credit card, ACH/bank transfer, paper checks, or something else? The answer to that question may narrow down or open up what platforms you want to consider.

There's a good chance that you'll run into additional pain points with a more general purpose solution vs a platform that's designed for agencies, especially when it comes to reporting. Accounting numbers are one thing and obviously necessary for books and taxes, but you often need more than just, revenue, P+L, and outstanding balance to understand what's going on with your business.

It's pretty difficult to move between these services, partly for the reason you mentioned (i.e. asking clients to re-enter payment details) as well as the pain that comes with migrating historical data. Your best bet may be to find something that you think will suit your needs and use both Square and whatever you settle on for a while until you're confident that you like the new platform enough to start moving clients over.

Also, I'd recommend you take a look the reviews on [TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com) when vetting a new platform. They seem to have the most genuine reviews when it comes to this category of products.

> From little experience but like liiiiittle (around maybe 400 dialed calls including those who not answer) I would say it work. Got two appointments and some ppl told me they want to know more and to send them something but i didn’t have a process for that a this time and assumed it was a trick to avoid saying no and saying yes. 

But it’s a number and a luck thing, you have to get the right person on the phone, that is available when you call, that is interested in your service when you call. (for example if i sell web design, then usually the person needs to already have thought abt it before you call) 

I think experimented ppl are way more at their ease when it come to convince to get that first meeting even if the client was not interested yet. 

Also you need to work a lot beforehand making sure you call the right person, that you think will be a fit, so you don’t lose their time and yours 

It’s a luck (luck comes from hard work), experience, patience and number thing. 

But i would defo recommend to do it bc you learn so much about selling when you do it; its a skill that has no price. Yes it works but its priceful since you ego, confidence get hurt in the process but when they say yes then you forget about all of this 

Good luck with your journey !

> 1. Don’t start an agency, get your brother to start freelancing first. I recommend he get started on Upwork. Outside of Upwork you need to convince people they need the service AND that you’re a good choice for the job. Inside people are already looking for what you offer.

2. Build a portfolio of 3 sites before he starts freelancing. He can work for very cheap for your network — family, friends, local businesses you may know. And of course, build your agency website and make sure it’s a jewel first.

3. Once both you and him have solid case studies and experience, then move outside of Upwork and begin looking for work. I recommend LinkedIn as the best way to get your clients by building a personal brand and authority there. Have a look at Niall Ratcliffe and his brother there, they’ve built an agency from scratch with this strategy.

To answer your question, about how I started:

- I worked as a freelance direct response copywriter on forums, and then freelance networks like eLance and oDesk at the time.
- I kept moving up to bigger and bigger clients.
- At one point I finished the copy for a funnel and the client told me they don’t have a team available atm to implement it. They told me they’ll pay me whatever money I need, but I should get the team together and execute. That’s how I started my first agency 😅

> Well, first of all, I think you should be able to define your scope and services first. Make sure that you have the proper and right objectives at the start to make sure that you deliver on what the client is actually paying you to deliver on. It's so easy to go off on all tangents especially when you feel like you're seeing a lot of problems popping up.

Next, once you're sure about your objectives, clearly explain and work with the client on the standards you'll be using to provide your recommendations. Are they expecting you to provide the expert opinion? Are they expecting you to incorporate their employees' opinions? Are they expecting you to find the compromise in between? Answering this would help you to also come up with your approach on whether you will continue to ask their employees for their approach or not. Bear in mind, they have been working at the company as well and may be seeing things you're not or are just not able to explain to you why they do things the way they do.

Lastly, telling your client's personnel that their ideas are dumb to their face is a surefire way not to get future jobs so use that sparingly.

> So…before answering this question, I think it would be good to segment the different types of consultants. This sub is primarily focused on consultants who work for large, established firms such as McKinsey or Deloitte. Most people at these firms joined through established recruiting pipelines at an undergraduate or graduate level school. It is possible to join these firms from industry, but the path in is a bit less clear. 

And then there are tons of other, smaller more niche consulting firms that deliver a wide variety of services. These firms are probably mostly made up of industry veterans who for some reason wanted to provide their services to a range of client companies rather than work for one company.

If you want to enter consulting, I’d recommend just googling whatever industry you’re in and then add “consulting” to the end of your search query. Then look at the firms that pop up, check out the bios of their employees, and see if you have any common experience or traits. 

Without knowing your education or experience it’s tough to say what type of consulting you’d want to do, or if you’d make a good candidate for a consulting job.

Short version - it's super specific to your organization and the other party. There is no single answer for this. 

I recommend having a conversation with your manager if you have a level of trust with them. While not encouraged, if one of my team was looking to go to a client, I wouldn't stop it. I would see them as a potential buyer if I play my cards right. Also, helping people achieve career goals or moves is just good karma.

> Congrats on going solo! That's an exciting (and nerve-wracking) step.

From what I've seen working with PI and criminal defense attorneys, you're absolutely right about intake being critical - especially when you're getting good leads. A missed call or poor first impression can mean losing a high-value case to a competitor.

A few attorneys I work with started with a part-time intake specialist or virtual assistant who could handle initial calls, basic screening, and appointment scheduling. This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.

One thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.

Also, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.

The intake person is probably the right first hire though. Someone who can professionally handle that first touchpoint while you're building everything else.

Good luck with the new practice!

> Congrats on going solo! Smart move thinking about foundational tech early—makes scaling way easier later.

For personal injury, I’d focus on:

1. **Case Management** – Tools like Clio or Filevine are solid and scale well as your caseload grows.
2. **CRM System** – HubSpot’s free tier is decent to track leads and client touchpoints.
3. **Phone System** – Get something that can handle multiple lines and voicemail transcription. Once marketing kicks in, the call volume can surprise you.

One thing a lot of solo PI attorneys overlook is **how to handle all the inbound calls**, especially after hours or when you’re in court. Missing even one can mean losing a solid case. Some folks use virtual receptionists or call-handling tools that can answer, qualify, and even book consults automatically—way cheaper than hiring full-time staff, and it helps you stay responsive.

The “5-minute rule” in PI is real—if you don’t respond fast, potential clients just move on to the next name on Google.

Also, **set up your accounting system** early. QuickBooks plays nice with most legal tools, and it’ll save you serious time (and headaches) come tax season.

Best of luck with the launch—solid foundation now pays off huge later.

The best lever is sequencing. Your outreach should drive to “reply with two details” rather than “book a call.” Then you send a tailored Loom once they’ve self qualified. Then the booking link. That way the calendar is the reward for fit, not the default action.

  
If you do hire a caller, pay them on qualified meetings held, not meetings booked, and record everything. One week of call recordings will tell you whether they’re building pipeline or torching your brand.What are you selling, what’s the price point, and do you have any proof asset you can send in place of a live pitch during business hours?

\- Inbound AI Voice Agents (best for high-ticket businesses with high call volume, ie. Dental Offices, HVAC, Plumbing, etc.)  These are often used as overflow handling, so conditional forwarding from their line if a call is going to be missed (receptionist is busy, on another call, or it's after hours)  
\- Proposal and document automation (Branded templates with dynamic variables that are generated automatically following a virtual meeting, transcript is sent to an agent that plots into the dynamic variables, then sends the draft to a human for review/final editing)  
\- Blog automation/SEO/AEO - every business should have a blog, ours runs twice weekly automatically, one that hits trending keywords in our niche, the other that hits keywords we consistently want to rank on (took us to #1/#2 based on the terms in our market within 2 weeks) - it is very high quality, and hits all of the metrics that google looks for (internal/external linking, ranks us in LLMs, has a table of contents, has an estimated read length, and much more)

Tons of custom GPT's where we can just share links to for our clients and they can use.  These are super fast and cheap for our clients, we often just hand them out to bring leads in for larger projects once they see the value a simple GPT can bring.

Last month, a client called during a board presentation asking about our API timeline. Instead of voicemail, the AI answered using the project docs I'd uploaded - gave him actual dates and technical details. 

The difference is it's not just a message-taker. It knows your business inside out. When clients ask "This is Bob, can you put me through to Bill?" or "Do you handle X?", they get real answers immediately.

You're absolutely right about calling back quickly though. I get alerts for priority clients and return calls within 30 minutes. The AI just handles the immediate questions while I'm genuinely unavailable.

Don't get me wrong, Ruby is solid. I have had colleagues that were very happy with their service. However, their focus wasn't on deep personalization. For a law firm, where building trust is key, that might matter more than in other industries.

There are smaller companies, like Starry Solutions (who I use now) that provide that hyper-personalized service. They took the time to learn the nuances of my practice and my clientele.

Also, Starry Solutions was significantly cheaper than Ruby. They just don't have the brand-name recognition or the amount of resources that Ruby does.

I went through something similar many years ago when I started out as a receptionist. Some of the attorneys would be unfriendly or have a bad attitude when I was being friendly to them as they walked in. It didn't bother me though, but the office manager noticed and called them all out on it in one of the attorney meetings. Her main point was that I answered a very busy switchboard and did so professionally. I always had a pleasant attitude and greeted everyone with a smile and left my problems at home.  She knew privately that I had some medical issues. She said you when you walk through that office door, leave the bad attitude and be ready to be nice and part of the team. She said don't you think the receptionist has bad days? She does, but she's professional and doesn't take it out on you. She was a great office manager. I learned so much from her.

Law firm politics can be tough. Get to know your colleagues but don't share too much personal information. Identify the people who are willing to assist you and the ones who are overworked and stressed and act accordingly. 

Best advice I got when I started out: If an attorney asks you a question you don't know the answer to never say "I don't know.", say "I'm not sure, let me get back to you." and then go figure it out.

I also did hourly or flat fee payment work that I otherwise wasn’t interested in but those kinds of cases (family law, bankruptcy, property dispute type stuff) helped me pay my living expenses while I waited for my contingency fee cases to settle. I kept my expenses very low and did everything myself until I had saved up capital to hire a receptionist and assistant.

> I normally write off negative reviews like yours because everyone's had some disgruntled clients who totally misinterpret the situation and are impossible to please. I mean, I have all 5 stars on my reviews so far but I mean, I'm good at my job :P 

With that said, I do love talking shit about bad attorneys so you know my gossipy ass was out googling the firm anyway. If this is the one in Vegas, I actually think you might be on to something. 

I mean, 195 solid 5 star reviews of Casey Xavier as an *attorney* generally, but from my review they don't read like actual client reviews and there are no case details, extremely generic. They read more like 'friends' or colleagues. Generic praise for the attorney and/or experience 'working with them' which can be anything. And zero reviews on yelp at the same time. And like 182 of those reviews are all from the last two months. Prior to that explosion of glowing reviews, he had a couple 1 stars. **Definitely seems like he bought the reviews.** 

>The disconnect between management and employees is so fake it's almost comical, and don't even get me started on job security – or lack thereof. Do your best and still get shown the door like yesterday's trash? Check.

This is common at those mills though, they treat people like your case. High volume, low care. It's unfortunate but a lot of the attorneys are probably working for a temp service, answering service, or are just highly underpaid. PI is one of those fields of law where a lot of staff can be helpful, whereas my firm has 3 attorneys and no staff (a full-time receptionist is next though, it's too much). Case mills tend to underpay people and churn through staff like crazy and cheap out whenever possible. 

As to the offshoring work, it's actually pretty common for stuff like calling for medical records requests and formulaic, admin HIPAA stuff. I've only seen the bigger case mills do it, and it's not really a great sign that the firm cares about your case specifically IMO, but that sort of work doesn't really need to be highly skilled either.

They were supposed to make up the rest of their salary by building a solo practice.  If it was successful enough I would have made them partner.  Seemed to be a winning formula but covid ended up killing the firm. Payroll was too much in the end with no work for several months (associates plus paralegal and receptionist).  I started at the firm right out of law school with this same comp plan and I made 100k on the side easily within 2 years.  At 150k on the side I made partner. I liked the stability of the paycheck and ramped up my 401k by contributing a large portion of the paycheck.

Also, I don't fault the PI guy for explaining why he's not taking a case. A lot of people just want to be heard. If you go through that with them, they can be your best referral sources.

We MUST bring a blazer everyday even though it is 100 degrees out and rarely cold here. (Important to note, the guy attorneys have dressed in blue jeans and t-shirts 🙃 There are no female attorneys on staff).

Yeah this is super sexist. The men wear tshirts and the women have to wear blazers and heels? Wtf?? Very unsurprising that there's no female lawyers at this firm, your firm prob wouldn't hire them, only hires women to be support staff, and potentially wouldn't hire them as staff unless they're young and conventionally attractive. A lot of male bosses like hiring women to be staff but not lawyers cuz they feel female staff are less likely to ask for raises and more likely to be Your firm is sexist AF and could potentially get in trouble for gender discrimination.

> Most of the support staff is young girls in our 20s (myself included). Most of us have only started working there in the past two years, majority within this year. I have heard rumors of a mass quitting of Case Managers but don’t know anything beyond that.

Aaaaand I was right. Definitely a super sexist firm. The whole reason the other staff haven't been there that long is cuz everyone else quit. 

> very few coworkers really had any positive reviews of their experience.

How unsurprising lol.

> the one time I briefly used my phone to decline my father's call and texted him that I was busy (took like 30s if I am being generous) I received a "gentle" reminder from the HR rep training me to stop using my phone. Again, I was on it for barely a couple seconds to decline a phone call. Another one of the receptionists up front was told to never wear her Apple Watch to work.

Your bosses are fucking crazy. That's not normal at all. Don't be goofing off at your desk, but you did nothing wrong. If you can't even wear an apple watch to work that's crazy. It's like your firm has a really obvious pattern of controlling what their female employees wear...oh wait

> There are cameras everywhere. Most of the supervisors (HR, head attorneys) have a bunch of tv screens in their office overlooking the rest of the staff's desks like a mall security guard.

The rampant sexism was already egregious, but this is the creepiest part. Security cameras are one thing, but those should be pointing towards doors and windows- not your employees. Many states have laws specifically banning this kind of stuff. How big is this firm? The smaller it is, the creepier it is. Even if it's big this is still insane. Orwell & Orwell is clearly a nightmare to work for. These psychos def spend a lot of time using their cameras to perv on their female staff. Make sure there's no cameras in the bathrooms, a place this vile would totally do something like that. Guarantee your bosses spend

Regardless, depending on your phone system, you could create virtual extensions called Line 1,2,3 etc, add them to a queue and make them pickup lines for each user, and set the call queue to be sequential with those "lines." So when a call comes in, it would flash as "line 1" and once answered, stay busy and "line 2" would flash for the next line.

Since I can decide who I sell to I prefer smaller companies since often the boss will still pick up the phone himself. But if I get a Gatekeeper I just say my name and the CEOs name expecting to be put thru and it usually works. If the receptionist asks what its about I just say "I have another question". I just keep it super short, if they keep hassling me I just tell them I have a call coming in, say thanks and hang up and dial the next. I never spend time with them or get friendly with them. But thats mainly because for me its a numbers games and I dont just want to sell to very few, specific people.

> It will affect you because of the Automation and reasoning capabilities.  Look at it this way.  If your job entails you touching a computer (It will be automated). If it requires  you to touch paper (It will be automated).  Presently with plain ol AI.  The AI can retrieve data pretty much like you doing a search on the web.  But it can only search for data or predict its retrieval if its out there and it's been trained on it.  This means putting guard rails around the AI train so it doesn't go off track.  But AGI or Generative AI is where the AI can actually do tasks and can reason and make decisions as opposed to just plain retrieving information.  Prime example.  Anything a receptionist does can be automated.  Anything a sales person does can be automated. Anything a secretary/accounting/IT/administrative person does can be automated.  This is just a few off the top of my head.

most AI phone solutions still have 500-800ms response delays which feels awkward. and they struggle with callers who talk over them or ask tangential questions.

before you switch, test each option with your actual intake questions. call your own demo line 5x pretending to be a nervous client who rambles. that'll tell you more than any sales deck.

> That's a pretty complex set of requirements, especially with the "legal firm" influence and not being able to run demos yourself. It's tough when you're trying to shop for something with one hand tied behind your back.



The tools you mentioned are all solid but for very different use cases. Notion is a super flexible canvas but can become the wild west without strict governance, which might be an issue for compliance docs. Guru is great for quick, card-based knowledge for internal teams. The legal angle usually points towards systems with rock-solid version control and audit trails, which is probably what's steering the conversation.



The trickiest part of your list is the AI that automatically tracks federal policy updates. That's usually a separate, specialized service (like a legal tech or compliance intelligence tool) rather than a built-in feature of a general KMS.



a different way to think about this problem might be to separate the \*storage\* of knowledge from the \*access\* to it. Full disclosure, I work at a company called eesel AI, and this is the kind of problem we help with. Instead of a massive migration project to one new system, you can plug an AI into whatever sources you end up using (even your existing Confluence, SharePoint, Google Docs, etc.).



We see companies in regulated spaces, like Covergo in insurance tech, use an AI assistant right inside MS Teams. It lets their employees ask questions like "what's our approved language for X policy?" and get instant answers sourced from all their compliance docs at once, without having to hunt through folders. It has Salesforce and Teams integrations like you're looking for.



This approach doesn't solve the 'auto-flagging of new legislation' part directly, but it makes finding the \*impact\* of that legislation across your dozens (or hundreds) of documents a matter of seconds. Might be a useful angle to consider as you're doing your research. Good luck with the search

> The honest truth is nobody really knows what works for AI platform visibility yet. The "GEO" space is mostly people repackaging basic content strategy and charging extra for it. Our clients asking about this usually calm down when you explain that ChatGPT and Claude pull from the same web content that Google indexes, so good SEO fundamentals still apply.

Bundling it into existing SEO makes more sense than upselling a separate service you can't really deliver on yet. The tactics that seem to help AI visibility are the same things that help traditional SEO anyway. Clear comprehensive content, proper schema markup, being cited by authoritative sources, answering questions directly. You're not doing different work, you're just positioning the same work differently.

The client expectation problem is real though. Everyone read one article about AI search eating Google and now they want guarantees you can't give. Set expectations early that AI platform visibility isn't trackable the same way, there's no rank tracker for "how often does ChatGPT mention us" and anyone claiming otherwise is lying.

If you absolutely need to show something extra, monitoring brand mentions across AI platforms and creating content specifically structured to answer the questions your ICP asks these tools is a reasonable add-on. But don't oversell it as some revolutionary new service when the playbook is still being written by everyone.

> You can use AI, but you need to also have an idea on the context of the answers. If you just follow the answers blindly then you could end up wasting months.

There’s two things to unpack.

ICP - the types of companies
Personas - the people in those companies

For ICP, what types of companies need your service? Are they early stage or more mature? Do they need to have certain team sizes? Particular geographies? Using certain technology? Running specific strategies (paid ads - if you’re a PPC or CRO agency for example).

Once you’ve narrowed down on those; then you need to think about the Personas.

What titles? What responsibilities, what problems do they have.

Then you connect your service to solve those problems in those companies.

So have a think about those two points; use AI to answer some of these questions and then pick one ICP and the personas within them and start conversations about those problems/challenges. 

Does that help?

One of my friends said they dealt with a situation where a bunch of firewalls were neglected. No updates, no firewall rule configs. Everything was default settings.

The real problem was that no one in the company’s IT department wanted to take ownership of the firewalls, claiming lack of manning, training and resources after 4 rounds of layoffs in 5 years. The managed service provider claimed that was not in their contract scope.

Claude is pretty good for coding and generating simple applications. There are other services that create useful 'mock up' apps for brainstorming. The Gemini-CLI tool (just released) is also interesting, especially coupled with mcp services. 

On the whole I think we are still in the exploration and prototyping stage. 

I've been focusing on using generative AI with large scale SQL data (MSSQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL, CSVs, etc.) to allow a user to ask a question and get simple queries answered but also complex modeling.

> Here's what ~~A~~I have to say about this:

# 1. The Limits of AI in Complex Human Problems

* **AI Can’t Fully Replace Human Judgment**: While AI excels at analyzing data and automating processes, management consulting often involves nuanced human problems like organizational change, leadership dynamics, and corporate culture. These areas require emotional intelligence, creativity, and interpersonal skills that AI can’t replicate.
* **Custom, Non-Standard Work**: Many consulting engagements are bespoke and require deep context, industry knowledge, and problem-solving that is unique to each client. AI may assist but cannot fully automate such tasks.

# 2. The Role of Partners Isn’t Just Oversight

* **Client Relationships**: Partners are often the face of the firm, building trust and long-term relationships with C-suite executives. This relationship-based aspect of consulting remains hard to automate.
* **Strategic Thinking**: Partners often lead high-level strategy work, which involves envisioning future scenarios, aligning diverse stakeholders, and facilitating decision-making. AI can provide insights, but the decision-making process requires human synthesis and judgment.
* **Sales and Business Development**: Partners drive revenue by selling work, leveraging networks, and understanding client needs—areas where human touch is still paramount.

# 3. ERP and IT Transformation Aren’t Going Away

* **Complexity Will Persist**: Even if AI enhances efficiency, large-scale ERP implementations will still require significant human oversight and expertise. Customizing and integrating systems across complex, global organizations isn’t a one-size-fits-all process.
* **AI Adoption Itself Requires Consulting**: Many firms are still struggling to implement AI and automation technologies. Consultants will play a key role in guiding organizations through these transformations, even if the tools themselves evolve.

# 4. Demand for Consulting Is Likely to Grow Overall

* **New Opportunities Created by AI**: AI will disrupt industries, creating new challenges and opportunities for clients. This will likely drive demand for consulting to help organizations navigate disruption, adapt to new business models, and implement AI-driven strategies.
* **Geopolitical and Economic Complexity**: Global volatility (e.g., supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, ESG pressures) ensures that companies will continue seeking external expertise to navigate uncertainty.

# 5. AI Will Augment, Not Replace

* **Improved Productivity**: AI could enhance the efficiency of consulting firms without eliminating roles altogether. For example, it might enable analysts and consultants to focus on higher-value tasks rather than being entirely replaced.
* **Hybrid Consulting Models**: The future may see a blend of AI-powered solutions and human advisory services. Partners who embrace AI and integrate it into their offerings could remain highly relevant.

# 6. Resistance to Change and Trust
