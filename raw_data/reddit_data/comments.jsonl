I hired on JD as a contract reviewer, but I didn't directly manage them.  I know they did well, so far as I was involved in their oversight.  I have a lot of thoughts about how to make working with somebody in the Philippines work out, and a lot of stories about it.  I just can't go into them here, but I'm open to connect for a call to talk shop one day.  I'll give you notes on the holidays, 13th month pay, and employers of record, ect.\n\nFor VR and phones, I also have a lot of experience and I have a couple of tips.  Just about all of them will expect you to forward your phone to them for the first ring, but it is probably possible for you to configure your system to ring to them only if you don't answer.  I can help you if they won't and you have trouble.\n\nI'll say this though, that does increase the chance that your callers will hang up before they answer and they probably won't hesitate to point that out.  There will be a delay as the call switches between your phone and their line, then their standard stuff between that first ring and their answer.  Personally, I think this is fine.  I suppose some practice areas it might be a big deal, but for most imho, if somebody wants to talk to an attorney, they aren't going to hang up 4 rings in.\n\nA service is either going to bill you by the minute or by the call.  If that is important to you, then it will narrow which services you can use.  Both models have their advantage.\n\nAll of the services will ask you to pay for so much per month in advance, then bill you overages after.  If you just don't have the volume to meet their bottom teir at signup, just about every one of them are open to reducing your account to a pay as you go, but they won't sign up new accounts that way.  It is sort of a trick and no guarantees, but you can pay like as low as $10 a month for 0 calls a month, then $10 a call every call over 1, then they will deflect sales calls for free.  It is a solid deal, so long as the quality or config isn't chasing away clients.\n\nFor some folks, though, that also doesn't matter too much.  Deflecting sales and inquires outside of the practice areas is more important than catching every single qualified lead because the operation is losing too much doing that on their own.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1767969739, "created_utc": 1767969739, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nylq40m", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1q7jhqv", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nylq40m", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1q7jhqv", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1q7jhqv/true_solo_needing_to_add_employees/nylq40m/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1767969758, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2026-01-09"}

Your goal is to create a rough initial standard operating procedure. It will be improved on over time but you need to start doing this asap\n\n3) then do the same for the next top few service offerings\n\n4) invest in systems that make you more efficient. I use (a) back office berries to answer & calls, schedule initial phone consultations and paid consults\n\n5) have a very selective filtering mechanism early. I only do free 15 minute phone consultations.  ANYTHING in person is mandatory paid consult. I offer a deal of $350 for up to 90 mins but you choose. ANYTHING that requires me to review documents is a paid consultation. I get about 2-5 of these a month. \n\n5)  in your consult determine the top questions you need to determine whether this is a potential ideal client. If not, end the consult as soon as you can (respectfully of course). If so, make your offer in that initial consult. Don\u2019t negotiate. Don\u2019t talk any more about it. Simply, \u201cit be my honor to help you with this, I charge a $10k retainer and bill $450/hour. If you\u2019d like to move forward today I can email you my service agreement, Intake form, and invoice\u201d\n\n6) you need to have the minimum tech to make this as painless as possible for clients and you. I use Clio grow and Clio manage to schedule appointments, email retainer, email intake form, take payments, etc. you can use whatever you want but I guarantee you adding just these lead intake/sales SOPs and tech will make you like 20% more efficient almost immediately and increase revenue and efficiently over time \n\n7) you should be very anal about your cases. Say no to the cases that are not going to be profitable. If you want to help people or do pro bono keep that separate from your business. A business is only a business if it is profitable. Or else it\u2019s a prison. \n\n8) focus on your business before paying any marketing, hiring people, etc.. you need to build the systems first, then invest in growth if you want. Having these systems will solve so many of the problems you mentions. \n\nFinally, remember the old bull/young bull story. Focus only on the case at a time. Slow if smooth and smooth is fast.

For one category of practitioners, \"huge success\" means maximizing profit for minimal effort. For another category of practitioners, financial success is as meaningful as the quality of service provided; money is important, but not everything. People seeking the latter success should consider the following:\n\n\\#1 - Pick up the phone. Take your clients' calls. Take unknown calls (prospective clients). Do it.\n\n\\#2 - Have a client pipeline. If you don't have the connections yet to get referral work...try a combination of sources: (a) look for contract work in your discipline (small governments such as cities and counties, as well as non-profits, often outsource their legal needs); and (b) supplement your practice with a handful of private cases. The private cases are likely to make more money than the contract, so you'll be excited at how it supplements the contract income. The contract work might generate leads who want to hire you privately. Very symbiotic. \n\n\\#3 - Bill monthly. If you don't bill, you don't have money. If you aren't disciplined about accounting, outsource this. \n\n\\#4 - Be motivated to solve problems. When a question arises for which you don't know the answer -- try find and answer, make some phone calls. If you don't like working, learning, and researching, then you  shouldn't be a solo. \n\n\\#5 - Invest in your own productivity and comfort. Keeping overhead super low is pointless if you your work is inhibited and/or you're frustrated all the time because you have to do things the tedious way. When deficiency of equipment / software / space is costing you, resolve it. Buy the reliable printer. Rent the office that you feel good sitting in day after day. \n\n\\#6 - Make your own appearances. This is related to #1. Do your own initial consultations. Make your own court appearances. Clients don't want to hire your staff, they want to hire you. You might be thinking that if you do this, you won't have time to take on as many clients...and that might end up being true, but you can charge way more for time, because clients will see the quality difference. \n\n\\#7 - Be organized. Your efficiency (time is money) depends on this. Accurate billing depends on this. Your sanity depends on this. \n\n\\#8 - Demonstrate your \\[high\\] quality in small ways. When you're a hot mess, clients know you're the wrong lawyer. So be mindful about your clothes, office appearance, even the bumperstickers on your car. At your office, have water/tea/coffee available for visiting clients. Use nice business cards. Air sophistication. \n\n\\#9 - Consider how other lawyers see you. Other lawyers will (or won't) be referring clients to you, based on what they know about you. What they see from you can mean a lot for your business. \n\n\\#10 - Rest. Make sure you have the fuel to be successful in the first place. Make boundaries to preserve your down time. When a terrible hearing gets avoided by a great resolution...treat yourself! \n\n  \nAnyway, that's one type of \"huge success.\"", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1761843030, "created_utc": 1761843030, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nm7y7i4", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1oiko27", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nm7y7i4", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1oiko27", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1oiko27/solo_success/nm7y7i4/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1761843048, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_general", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-10-30"}

Can I send you ChatGPT's analysis of my legal problem?\n\nA: Please don't use generative AI to write your emails to us. And please don't ask ChatGPT or another AI large language model (LLM) about your legal problem and paste the answer into your email to us. Whether you're a potential client or a current client, these kinds of emails make it really hard for us to do our jobs.  \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nUnlike most law firms, we don\u2019t bill by the hour. Our flat fee model keeps our pricing competitive and transparent while allowing us to work efficiently. We are generally happy to answer any extra legal questions that you (our human client/prospective client) have for us, but we will not answer a string of nonsensical bullet points that you generated in a few seconds using ChatGPT.  \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nIf we responded to everything our clients generated with AI, our business model would no longer work because we'd have to waste significantly more time on each project than we did before ChatGPT became popular. It's not fair to our other clients for us to spend so much time answering largely irrelevant questions that no human would ever think to ask us.  \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nThe analysis offered by ChatGPT is almost never relevant to our clients' specific situations, and often isn't even relevant to the trademark application process at all. ChatGPT uses the web and other publications as its data sources, not real trademark application filing data. It seems to have no idea what you can and cannot include in a trademark application, or at what stage in the trademark process you should file an argument or petition against an existing trademark registration.  \n\u00a0\u00a0  \nChatGPT is even worse at drafting emails asking us about the services we offer.

I plan to ditch clio someday and am duping to leap and clio so that i don't have to migrate the data later. \n\nVXT works with many law practice management systems running the gamut from action step to Smokeball, Clio to Leap, and many others. \n\nIf you go with an annual plan, it's $37.50 /user /month. On a month-by  -month plan it's $50/user/month. There\u2019s an additional charge of $5 per phone number per month. But they tell me that one phone number can work for large firms with multiple users on separate calls simultaneously, so \u2026 I ported only one number and am dropping the other three I used for direct lines and a fax line. \n\nOver the past six years I've searched for and demoed several VoIP services and this is the best one I've found so far for a law firm. \n\nThe other VoIP services I've looked at are really geared towards sales and call centers, rather than a law firm environment. \n\nTo get them to create a communications log entry and a time entry most of them require either a third party connector or a zapier build. \n\nHomie ain\u2019t got time nor patience for that. \n\nI've used DialPad for 2.5 years and i hate it. The interface is hard to navigate, i struggle to find calls in the call history, the call flow builder bites, it drops calls, the phone often doesn't ring and my staff just get a voicemail notification. \n\nPlus, dialpad within the past 6 months did something annoying that requires you to use a third party connector to send a communications log entry to clio. It doesn\u2019t sync the ai summary. It just creates a blank communications log entry. \n\n I never could get zapier to import the AI summary and Dialpad creates a separate time entry for each call participant and you then have to scrutinize the bill to ensure you\u2019re not double or quadruple billing a call that involved multiple parties. \n\nDialpad claims a low per user price of $25/month, but I get hit regularly with additional charges and fees that make the price comparable to or higher than VXT. \n\nAnother VoIP I\u2019ve found that designed for law firms is CORVUM. Lower cost, no frills interface that works with Clio. Its best feature is a text message billing module that creates a time entry based on the character count in a given day\u2019s text exchanges with a particular number. \n\nBut when i used it, CORVUM did not offer transcription and an ai summary. \n\nBefore i switched to VXT I looked at over a dozen VoIP providers and created a \u201cwet dream\u201d list of features that a law firm VoIP needs and shouldn\u2019t bother with. \n\nVXT rated best on the lists of wants and don\u2019t wants. \n\nBuilt-in integration with practice management system to sync contacts and matters from the practice management system to the VoIP, which then posts the time entry and ai notes into the practice management system. \n\nNo programming required on my end. \n\nSimple, clean interface. \n\nNo desk phone needed. \n\nOption to take calls with either my computer or my cell phone. \n\nDecreased emphasis on sales and marketing analytics. \n\nSimple setup for text messaging at a nominal upcharge. \n\nSimple-to-use call flow builder with option to divert calls to an answering service or a particular user. \n\nAI summary and transcription. \n\nThe only thing VXT lacks is incoming fax service and a videoconference feature. But I can use Teams for videoconferencing and online fax services abound.\n\nI\u2019ve used VXT for a week now and I can already navigate it better than I ever managed with Dialpad. \n\nI know that\u2019s a very brief time to assess the VXT product, but it nails the things I really need it to do and doesn\u2019t inundate me with sales/marketing analytics. \n\nBefore I found VXT we were about to go with Quo (formerly OpenPhone). But we would have had to build an integration with Leap and Clio through zapier and some Reddit posts indicated displeasure with the service since the conversion of the company to Quo. \n\nContact VXT for a demo and if you\u2019ll dm me I\u2019ll give you my info to pass onto them. I doubt there\u2019s any sort of referral spiff, but it\u2019s always good to know where a lead comes from.\n\nI found VXT via an ad that popped up in my personal Facebook feed.

I'm an independent remote law clerk.  I service attorneys across the USA and a few solicitors in the UK.  (I'm a dual citizen and I went to law school in both countries) I've clerked in a few state courts and I've also worked for office of the Public Defender.  I'm barred with a couple tribal courts in CA and WI and do family court work there.  With respect to the attorney I work with, I am clerking remotely whilst I study the for the bar.  I'm also a mom and I enjoy working from home and traveling extensively over the summer and still being able to work.  I love this work.  And I love the prospect of working in the same capacity (with higher rates) once I pass a state bar.\n\nThe attorneys I work with are all solo or small firms.  I have been a remote clerk for the past 16 months and I work on an ad hoc basis.  Sometimes this means working with one attorney for 2 weeks at a time, then nothing for months.\n\nThe work I do is drafting motions, appeals, complaints and lots of discovery.  I'm Lexis-certified so I also do lots of legal research.  I have my own robust Lexis and Westlaw access.   I'm not sure if there's a big difference between what I do and what a paralegal does - but I do have 2 law degrees (USA & UK).  I don't do filing or anything in PACER and I don't really do admin tasks.  I mean, if asked, I probably would, but my rate varies between $75-$95 per hour, and I think it's more economical to get an admin assistant to do the admin work. Also, I am now so busy with work I've had to hire my own assistant to help project manage my services.\n\nWhen I first work with an attorney, I focus on providing a quality work product.  From doing that consistently, trust is built.  Some attorneys hand over parts of cases to me; some attorneys will hand over an entire case.  It really depends what's needed.  I don't have a personal preference here.\n\nI'm NEVER the attorney on record (as I'm not an attorney). I'm simply a ghostwriter.  I've set up my own LLC and my own website, specifically working as a law clerk.  Once I pass the bar I will probably need a new marketing strategy.  \n\nSo my advice to any attorney who is outsourcing:\n\n1. Find someone that you think you may be able to trust.\n\n2. Give them a small project first, build the trust.  Scrutinize their work product.  Is the quality as good or better than you would submit?\n\n  \n3. Ask them if they use AI.  Ask how they use it, how they ensure privacy.  Ask how they ensure their citations aren't hallucinations from the AI.  They should have solid answers for this.\n\n4. Ask about the terms of payment.  I bill my attorneys weekly.  I charge hourly but for big projects I will give a flat fee rate.\n\n5. Speak to them on the phone before you engage them to do work.  This is helpful.  Some of the attorneys I work with I've never spoken to them on the phone but the relationship still works.\n\n6. Ask them about insurance -- especially if they are sign as the attorney on record.\n\n  \nThat's all the tips I have for now.  If any attorneys here are looking for an ad hoc remote law clerk DM me and I can send credentials and a link to my website.

But I\u2019m doing well financially, nearly 20 years in, definitely worth it.   Ask me ten years ago, I was in a dead end in house job and would have definitely eventually gotten laid off and would have given you a different answer.  It sounds bad, but the beginning of your career you learn how to be a competent attorney, but the ones who make money are better at client and work generation.  And honestly, some of the best and sharpest legal minds I have ever worked with just suck at this and they end up working for someone else and their salary is capped on how much they can work. \n\nI have a family member in medicine and it\u2019s a different life. If you are in a major city, MBA\u2019s have taken over the medical profession and it\u2019s kind of similar. You get paid a high salary and work your butt off.  Unlike law, you can go to more rural areas and get paid a lot more, but you will have to also work harder and with less resources.  Whereas law needs to typically stay close to where the action is to generate clients. \n\nOne difference is that it is harder to be an entrepreneur in clinical medicine. In the old days you can set up a GP office and do well.  Less so today, MBA run clinics and insurance providers have all the power, the money route is to become a specialist and work for a hospital that can pay you.  The profession really got screwed by business people. Doctors are incredibly smart and hard working, but they got played.  \n\nWith law, you can at least create your own office still and learn how to find and build a practice and get clients.  With the rates that big firms have (and the quality of work received), the opportunity to undercut them is there for small and medium sized firms.  The same AI is being used by the associates in both firms, it\u2019s just the billing rate that is different if you pay for brand name.  \n\nSo with what I know now, there is more opportunity in law for disruptive services and a better work life balance compared to other areas like medicine.  Not to mention that the entry level cost and time for medicine is much higher, so also cost out the lost income there.   If you are great at studying and just grinding and taking abuse, you can do well in both, but if you think you are more business minded and see law as a service to be sold, it can have more upside than medicine.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1746564842, "created_utc": 1746564842, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "mqyar9t", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1kgafcv", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_mqyar9t", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1kgafcv", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1kgafcv/is_law_still_a_lucrative_path/mqyar9t/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1746564861, "saved": false, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 5, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-05-06"}

If you are the lawyer, to negotiate the bills with an LOP, you have to say the case value turned out to be less than you hoped and so the doctor should take less than you promised they would get. I have never litigated one but I could easily see a doctor saying that the LOP is a contract that guarantees full payment and, therefore, it must be paid at 100%. \n\nContrast this with a healthcare provider lien. A lien is a statutory right of reimbursement. Those are almost negotiable based on case value regardless of the amount of the lien compared to the settlement. The doc can\u2019t say \u201cyou promised,\u201d he/she/they can only say \u201cthe law promised.\u201d  \n\nDon\u2019t forget, a US medical provider always has at least two ways to get paid after the services are rendered. First is based on contract.  They have all the remedies that contracts give anyone including collection actions and breach of contract claims. Lien is the second if there is a know PI case. They often don\u2019t like the first because it is time consuming and recovery rates are low. They typically love liens because if the client is represented by a good PI lawyer, the doc is likely going to get paid and paid a lot more. Pushing for liens allows the client to get the treatment needed but does not completely handcuff you as the lawyer. And if the doc does not like the lien-based solution, remind them they can go for a breach of contract case.

This is Andy, one of the owners of SMB Team. First, I want to thank everyone for their comments here, including the constructive criticism!\n\nI\u2019d like to address some of the concerns raised in no particular order. Since this will be a longer post, I\u2019d like to invite anyone with additional questions to email me at andy \\[at\\] smbteam \\[dot\\] com. I\u2019m more than happy to hop on a call, answer your questions, and provide free marketing tips\u2014no sales pitch, I promise.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that we\u2019re not perfect. We\u2019re a fast-growing company, and like many of the law firms we serve, our goal is always to deliver the best results possible. Sometimes, things don\u2019t go as planned, but when they don\u2019t, Bill (my business partner) and I do everything we can to address the situation quickly and effectively.\n\nAlmost all of our clients (nearly 600 law firms) have either my cell phone number or Bill\u2019s, and we pride ourselves on being available. If any issues arise, we always encourage clients to reach out directly, and we\u2019re committed to resolving concerns swiftly. We genuinely care about the outcomes our clients achieve.\n\nI started the company in 2012 at my kitchen table, and Bill and I merged companies in 2022. We\u2019ve since grown to around 130 employees, which comes with its own challenges. As anyone who has built a business knows, growing pains and staff turnover are part of scaling. While we work hard to maintain a strong culture, sometimes team changes are necessary to ensure the best results for our clients.\n\nWe\u2019ve had to make tough decisions regarding staffing, but we believe those changes ultimately improve the experience and outcomes for our clients. It\u2019s never easy, but we are constantly learning and improving as we grow.\n\nRegarding some comments about our services being similar to other marketing companies: we offer a broad range of services that go beyond marketing, including fractional CFO, fractional COO, bookkeeping, and intake support. Our approach is holistic, addressing every key area of law firm growth\u2014consistent lead generation, intake systems, building a strong team, and financial planning. This sets us apart because we\u2019re focused on long-term, sustainable growth, not just marketing.\n\nI\u2019m also proud to say that every success story, review, and testimonial we share is 100% real. We\u2019ve never paid anyone to provide a testimonial or fabricated a case study, as that\u2019s both unethical and unnecessary given the results our clients have achieved.\n\nLastly, I\u2019ve noticed that some comments are from people who haven\u2019t worked with us directly, which tells me we have more work to do in educating the broader legal community. Our goal is to help as many lawyers as possible, whether they choose to work with us or not. That\u2019s why we share so much free content, from over 1,700 YouTube videos to various free and paid events. Whether you hire us or not, I\u2019m committed to helping as many law firm owners as possible grow their firms.\n\nTo wrap things up, I\u2019d love to speak directly with anyone who has questions, comments, or concerns. You\u2019ll hear from me personally, and you can see what I\u2019m all about. Then, you can decide for yourself if you\u2019d like to work with us\u2014no pressure and no sales pitch. Feel free to email me at andy \\[at\\] smbteam \\[dot\\] com anytime.\n\nAlso, if you\u2019d like a physical copy of my books *5-Star Attorney* and *Law Firm Growth Accelerator*, just email me and I\u2019ll be happy to ship a copy on me. *5-Star Attorney* is the first book ever written that shows lawyers how to grow their firms using social proof, and *Law Firm Growth Accelerator* shares everything we\u2019ve learned in the last 12 years about scaling a law firm for more freedom, profit, and better client results. It\u2019s also our entire system, so you can see exactly what we teach.\n\nAnd don't forget to check out my YouTube channel, *Lawyer Marketing with Andrew Stickel*, where you'll find hours and hours of actionable, free content to help you grow your law firm.\u00a0\n\nThanks again for all the feedback, and I look forward to connecting with anyone who reaches out!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1727989590, "created_utc": 1727989590, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lq78168", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1e25r1g", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lq78168", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1e25r1g", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1e25r1g/smb_team/lq78168/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1727989606, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-10-03"}

There is just so many little low hanging fruit type things that you can do that get your name out there.  Tip staff well and leave a card.  Tell everyone that you are a lawyer.  Give your staff bonuses to refer cases and have them all tell everyone they are a lawyer.   I have been growing a firm for a year and a half - our organic traffic used to be under 200 a month on google, it's over 12,000 now and been growing like a weed.  We have a full time in house call center to handle the call volume.  We try to find a home for every call.  Something comes in that we don't do - were referring it to someone we know that does that and saving them some time searching the internet more.  Those referrals come back full circle.  Happy to answer any questions and point you in the right direction.  DO NOT JUST BLINDLY TRUST MARKETING COMPANIES.  You need to know your way around the ad accounts and make sure they arent wasting money on leads that you arent interested in.  Google has gotten bad and exact match keywords have become more broad and the broad stuff has just become an asterisk for whatever google wants.  You will see that you have to manage negative keyword lists daily or you are burning dollars.  Ad companies and google arent going to come give your refunds.  Keep your finger on the pulse of what every dollar is doing and how you are measuring those results through call data or lead data or chats or forms or email.  Whatever it is - those leads that don't convert are lost opportunity, unless you follow-up with them with ongoing email campaigns, friendly reminders, helpful blogs, etc.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1718160744, "created_utc": 1718160744, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l87r81z", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_18076y4", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l87r81z", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_18076y4", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/18076y4/law_firm_owners_what_do_you_do_for_marketing/l87r81z/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1718160761, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-06-12"}

I graduated 10 years ago and also had a ton of trouble getting my first job.\n\n>In Canada, where I live, you are required to article before you can be called to the bar - basically a 10 month apprenticeship with a qualified lawyer.\r  \n\r  \nWhat worked for me - made a huge lists of firms in my city that I was interested in. Sent out a personalized cover letter with a copy of my transcript, resume, and references to the most senior person at each firm. In my email I said I would follow up with a call next week. Probably sent out 50 -75 applications this way. Then I\u2019d follow up each day with a telephone call to the firms on my list, crossing out the ones that weren\u2019t interested.\r  \n\r  \nSome were rude but most were surprising nice and were happy to chat. Some recommended other firms or put me in touch with other lawyers they thought might be hiring. Some agreed to meet me for a cup of coffee just to chat. I got 3-4 interviews from firms that had no plans to hire but liked my application and my enthusiasm. I botched a couple of them but all you need is one. I ended up articling at a 10 lawyer firm with a solid reputation. It ended up being a horrible place to work but I got called and then moved on to better things.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone that met with me said they got dozens of resumes a week but I was the only one that actually called (and called continuously). One lawyer who never answered his phone eventually agreed to meet me if I would stop calling him (he never told me to stop, was just screening my calls).\r  \n\r  \nAt the time I was searching for articles there was an articling crisis like never before - a lot of new grads couldn\u2019t get jobs. With the shortfall in articling positions it meant every job posting had hundreds of applicants. I found this was a good way to get myself in front of some firms that weren\u2019t even interviewing anyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA couple other comments on reflection:\n\n1. While I applied to job postings, I didn't focus so much on those - I figured they were getting hundreds of other applicants who were also vying for their attention. Looking back I don't know if it would have been better to focus more on these firms or not.\n2. Articling students generally aren't paid a ton -  I wonder if this factored into my ability to get interviews with firms that weren't actively hiring. Like taking me on wasn't going to be a big expense. \n3. I spent an insane amount of time perfecting my covering letter and resume. I had heard that any mistake in them was reason for a potential employer to pass on me. Now I hire articling students and employees myself - I barely glance at the cover letter and just care about the substance of the resume. I don't eliminate anyone for minor formatting or other errors. Maybe if we had hundreds of qualified applications I would though? I did get at least 2 interviews from lawyers that really liked the writing in my cover letter though.\n4. If there is no requirement to article where you are, consider trying to start your own law firm as part of your job efforts. After I finished my articles I again had trouble finding a job and most firms I spoke to told me if I had a book of business that would really make me more desirable. From this I started my own law firm - helped me pay bills, get some experience and ultimately get another job. \n\n* Try to get a few mentors (try to tap lawyers you are contacting for work/networking and see if they'll offer some mentorship). You will also learn a ton about managing a firm (obtaining insurance, trust accounting accounting requirements, retainer letters, etc.). You don't need office space - can do the whole thing virtually. Getting a handful of clients will show firms you are more entrepreneurial and have some experience.  \n* If you do start your own law firm - you need to be careful what you charge for your services. On the one hand if you offer reduced fees (which you can with little or no overhead) you'll get clients and experience fast. The downside is that you won't be able to transition these clients to a firm job.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1704381411, "created_utc": 1704381411, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1704381682, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kgachy0", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_18y6tay", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kgachy0", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_18y6tay", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/18y6tay/admitted_attorney_cant_find_an_entry_level/kgachy0/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1704381435, "saved": false, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 4, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general", "blocker_not_ready"], "_date": "2024-01-04"}

This person, if they have a nice personality, can also handle client inquiries, answer (non-legal) questions, and take messages.\n\nAs time progresses you will train the assistant to prepare documents from templates, and how to file with the court. Of course you review pleadings before approving a filing, but having someone to prepare documents and organize files is a big deal.\n\nAs you grow, the assistant may also help with billing tasks. I would recommend a separate bookkeeper or accountant to actually handle the money, but an assistant can make sure that billing statements and requests for payment go out on time to keep your money coming in.\n\nI consider a paralegal to be a separate position. There is a lot of blurring between roles and tasks, but a good paralegal should be able to talk to clients, do legal research, and draft substantive legal arguments for your review. An untrained assistant who doesn't know legal  can not be expected to do those things. \n\nSome attorneys will hire a person to do intake interviews, which is kind of like a consultation but without giving legal advice. The purpose is to vet the client, assure them that your firm can take care of their matter, give them an idea of what to expect next, and get them to sign up and make a deposit of funds (for hourly work). This is like a sales role and is kind of advanced in terms of training required. \n\nAdmin work? \n\nUse a service like Gusto to handle employee pay. \n\nSet up a separate account at your bank that's just for payroll.\n\nMake a checklist of tasks that new employee will have to do. One of new employee's jobs will be to expand the checklist with \"how-to\" descriptions for everything they do. This document will be come the manual for your law office, so that new hires can refer to it, and so that you can edit and correct any mistakes in employee assumptions or conduct. \n\nHelpful to offer a lower hourly rate for training pay, then rate bumps up after new hire can complete tasks A, B, and C. Don't make the tasks too hard or the employee will think you're playing games. A bump in pay will come for demonstrating they can reliably do tasks G, H, and I. \n\nNew employee has to understand confidentiality, conflicts, and the difference between legal information and legal advice. Tell them \"when in doubt refer questions to the attorney!\" \"Don't make predictions or give legal advice!\"\n\nHave them sign a confidentiality agreement. Prepare a welcome letter in advance, that spells out terms of employment and probably emphasizes that the position is \"at-will\" employment. \n\nAll of the topics I've mentioned here are the subjects of numerous books, webinars, training programs, business coaches, etc. This post is intended just to get you thinking.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1692904407, "created_utc": 1692904407, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1692910070, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jxlcwf0", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1608cz8", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jxlcwf0", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_1608cz8", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1608cz8/when_did_you_hire_your_first_staff_member/jxlcwf0/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1692904411, "saved": false, "score": 34, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 34, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing"], "_date": "2023-08-24"}

Defendant (borrower) did not reply to the petition that was properly served. Default judgement was granted and sheriff sale date was set. One week before the sale, the defendant gets a lawyer. The sale is postponed and a motion to dismiss the judgement is filed based on an allegation of improper/insufficient service. Also included in the filing was 7 pages of straight BS reminding the court that it had the power to grant the dismissal. \n\nI went to the hearing and factually destroy the service allegations. I told the judge there was no legal basis to grant the motion to dismiss nor was there an equitable basis because the defendant still had every avenue available to redeem the property. Further, I told the judge that granting the motion would set a precedent that people could avoid paying their bills, service, etc. and delay the process simply by finding a lawyer willing to knowingly make up an allegation and file an answer. \n\nThe judge said that she agreed with what I said but she was granting the motion because \u201cthey have a lawyer now.\u201d  I asked for the legal or equitable basis for the ruling. She yelled at me and said she will do what she pleases and what she feels is right regardless and the defendant has a lawyer so they should get more time. I argued and asked why my client should continue to go without payment and continue to pay the taxes and insurance while the defendant lives there for free and that treating my client differently just because they are a bank isn\u2019t following the law. She got mad and yelled that I could \u201ctake her up and just see what happens.\u201d She knew I wasn\u2019t going to appeal and she let me know that the actual law means absolutely nothing - they do what they want for whatever reason they want. \n\nSo if you get yelled at, just smile and nod and get out of there as quickly as you can, realizing the judge is probably just a power tripping asshat with insecurities who probably hasn\u2019t been laid in months. \n\nYes.

Grow\u2019s tedious form builder you can\u2019t build a form such that a client can enter useful information, e.g. witness names / addresses / age / expected testimony, because to gather such information in the form you have to program the form to obtain info about a pre-existing contact. \n\nIn Grow you should be able to create custom fields as you build an automated document. \n\nNo. \n\nFirst you must create custom fields. Surely you can create custom fields while building an intake form ! Right?\n\nNo. \n\nYou can, but should not, creat custom fields in Grow at all. \n\nStupidly, a custom field created with Grow will not import into Manage. \n\nSo\u2026\nYou create custom fields in Manage, import those custom fields into Grow, link form fields to the custom fields, and then build the automated document. \n\nI paid Clio to build intake forms at $50 each for 5 areas of law.\n\nPretty forms. Good data. But\u2026\n\nThe forms asked for times, dates, integers, contact cards, picklist responses, multiple choice answers, yes/no responses, radio buttons, etc. \n\nAll incompatible with both the Grow document automation tool and with Manage altogether. \n\nSo, pretty, useless forms contained data that I had to cut-and-paste or re-type, which was the very evil I sought to avoid by biting into Clio so that I could automate. \n\nI\u2019ve spent DAYS with Clio tech support calls and Clio remand Bo better than Microsoft outlook or Google Workspace. It does billing, but WiseTime, Bill4Time, and others do billing at a lower point. \n\nOften, One tech support person has told me to do steps 1,2, and 3 to unlock a Clio capability.

I quickly found that anyone wanting me to do a simple flat fee matter wasn't worth the money they were willing to pay based on the overhead costs of onboarding new clients and offboarding them when the matter was concluded.  I now only take contested litigation matters.   You expressed below you were worried you'd lose some of the high dollar matters.  I have my staff call consults before they come in to do conflicts checks and during that I have them get a summary of their issues; that way I can look at what it is and determine if it's something that's appropriate for myself or for an associate.  I also have an answering service handle inbound intake requests that gives me a brief summary of the matter and some identifying information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, I cut down on advertising.  What's the point when I can barely handle the work coming in?  Phone still rings based on google reviews and basic SEO.  People often shop lawyers anyway so I may not be the first call and that's ok.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth, I opened up branch offices.  This was partly to get more attorneys into the firm (hire them where they live and all that) and partly to have work handled in areas closer to where the clients were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFifth, I got militant about payments.  I do hourly billing so probably a little bit different but if people don't make their retainer requests I drop them.  Your client's wouldn't keep going to work if their employer's paycheck's bounced; it's bizarre to me that clients think their attorneys should work for free just because they need their services.  I'm not a charity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI myself hired a consultant and wasn't that impressed.  I'm on my second one now.

Don\u2019t even consider it. Run. \n\n\nSource: Me - ex 2100 billable lawyer and current local government lawyer \n\nOkay, telling a lawyer not to consider an issue is completely useless so here is why I think you shouldn\u2019t do it and an answer to the questions you posed:\n\n\nThe only firms I know of that are still requiring 2100 are insurance defense firms. If that is the case here, you will absolutely hate your job daily. \n\nYou will spend hours daily reviewing medical documents and writing letters summarizing and analyzing them to determine what damages are attributable to the incident and what the settlement value is. \n\n\n*Why hours on just this?*\n\n\nBecause a lot of people have on-going treatment, were in treatment for something prior to the incident, malinger, or (not extremely common but you\u2019ll see a few within your first year) an attorney sends discovery regarding costs clearly unrelated to the incident, but are temporally proximate to the  incident or ongoing treatment (you\u2019ll quickly figure out which of those attorneys have too large a case load, are intentionally doing it to see if it slips through giving their client, and thereby themselves, financial gain, or are just poor attorneys). \n\nThis will literally be the bulk of your job. Review documents, summarize, analyze cost, attempt to settle for lowest cost possible. You will sit in your office all day on the computer and making occasional settlement phone calls. \n\n\n*How do you bill 2100?!?!*\n\n\nOh boy\u2026 you will hear the phrase \u201ccapture your time\u201d and that will have to be your mantra. Everything you do needs to be accounted for. Insurance companies will not let you block bill so you better know each companies billing guidelines so you don\u2019t violate their definition of block billing. Also, insurance companies have started automatically flagging billing entries with certain words and denying them which means at the end of the month you\u2019ll have to spend time fixing your billing entries as you learn what is and isn\u2019t allowed (and the time you spend fixing everything isn\u2019t billable and will add up as you\u2019re learning). \n\n\nIf the mind numbing work and hours don\u2019t scare you away, here is the scariest risk of an ID firm that requires 2100: CULTURE AND ETHICS\n\nYou can\u2019t overlook the fact that, ultimately, every single private practice is a business. It\u2019s purpose is to produce a profit for its owners. In a law firm, the non-equity lawyers role is to generate revenue for the firm by providing services at a certain rate. The revenue generated by the non-equity lawyer must exceed the cost to the firm for employing the non-equity lawyer. \n\n\nID is a cut-throat field. There is a lot of business for sure, but there are a lot of competitors for that business and margins are slim. At a firm that requires 2100, the business apparatus of the firm determined that in order for the firm to maintain/grow profit, it was necessary for its non-equity lawyers to generate at least (2100*average billing rate). \n\n\nThis leads to a very high pressure to actually hit that number. At some firms, you\u2019ll have senior associates telling you that the only way to meet your requirement it to just bill a .4-.8 per 100 pages of docs reviewed regardless of how much time you actually spent reviewing them. Some people even purposefully delay emails/responses so they can bill them each one as an independent .1. \n\n\nEven if it\u2019s not an insurance defense firm, the 30k raise doesn\u2019t make it worth the increased amount of time you\u2019ll spend working, additional stress, and, in all likelihood, higher medical expenses.", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1675634225, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1675671878, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "j7d0bak", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_10ufv1h", "locked": false, "name": "t1_j7d0bak", "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_10ufv1h", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/10ufv1h/2100_billable_hours/j7d0bak/", "retrieved_on": 1678264591, "score": 14, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 14, "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_general", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-02-05"}

That's the reaction patients are put off by. \n\nUnfortunately,  many patients mistakenly believe Doctors know EVERYTHING about the science behind ALL of the products they use. So their questions,  I believe, are from a place of innocence, not challenge or suspicion.\n\nThink of a way to answer questions you have no answer for in a way that will assure them & quiet them down, but not lose faith/trust in you. It's a slippery slope. You, the doctor, have to assess the situation.  \n\nAnd yes, patients may ask questions about things beyond their pay grade; while being mindful of your time, ask if they want the long or short answer and go from there.\n\nIf they question EVERYTHING, perhaps you need to offer to schedule a consultation appointment (cash) with a knowledgeable staff member to go over the complete treatment plan and provide a handout with answers to basic innocuous questions.  That way you're not taking up chairtime or taking too much of the Doctors' time away from patients. \n\nI've done that many times. It's actually quite fun. \n\nPerhaps the patient could be required to submit a list of questions so the Doctor can answer the questions beforehand.  \n\nHaving demonstration typodonts, visual diagrams/drawings and other teaching aids is helpful too. \n\nIn one office I worked in we had a special consultation room just for this purpose.  Every patient got one.\n\nJust remember too much information leads to information overload. \n\nSimply explain you'd love to address their concerns, and need to set up an appointment (probably not covered by ins) to do that. Here are the fees.....are you interested? PIF is expected at time of appointment. Otherwise you can answer simple, basic questions as they arise. \n\nPersonally,  I'd  recommend no less than 45 mins to an hour so they don't feel rushed. Plus, if it's not the Doctor giving the presentation,  you won't have to charge as much to where it might be cost prohibitive.  \n\nIf they start asking too many \"deep\" questions,  simply explain the person doesn't have a dental license and can't give medical/ dental advice.....only what the Dr. has authorized her to share. \n\nThere's a saying that goes something like......\nMost people won't remember what you did, but they'll always remember how you made them feel. \n\nMake your patients feel valued, appreciated, special and worthy of your time.

We charge a $75 cancellation when it happens and require deposits of 1/2 the planned tx for the appointment. When they complain, and they always do, the front is told to tell them only the dentist can remove the charge and would they like to speak with me. If I\u2019m not currently available, they get a call back number for that day. I always take the call or call them back\u2026if they are too emotional/irrational to listen, I have the staff get their number whether I am available or not so they cool down some.\n\nMost people just don\u2019t understand the business structure. We\u2019re not like Walmart with a cashier standing there for whatever comes in. I explain that I or the hygienist reserve special time for just them. When they call at the last minute, I still have to pay that hygienist and assistant to just sit there and do nothing as I have no opportunity to get someone else in that we can help. I tell them everyone wants dentistry to be less costly and that this is the number one thing that makes it cost more and we are trying to keep their costs down. They invariably say something about $75 being too much. I then tell them the precise number of times they did it and to think of it instead as $/each time and how we graciously gave them multiple passes before. Then it\u2019s the, \u201cyeah but this time my house flooded!\u201d (Which is usually a bs made up answer if they didn\u2019t start with it in which case we likely would have accepted the excuse and moved on before I\u2019m involved) in which case I answer I\u2019m very sorry to hear that, but your house didn\u2019t flood the other 14 times and I have to draw the line somewhere. Sometimes I will pull out the this has to be a mutual respect relationship. You love that I never leave you sitting in my waiting room more than 6 minutes because I respect your time, you must respect my time as well\u2026.and you aren\u2019t. I rarely reverse the charge because I give my well-trained front the latitude to assess the situation and decide whether to go down the charge or deposit path.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a bad review over it, which frankly surprises me as this has been my approach for nearly 10 years. Probably lost some patients over it though, but I don\u2019t want those patients. Let them mess up someone else\u2019s schedule. I tell them that too when they threaten to leave (I\u2019d love to continue being your dentist, but honestly I would rather you find another provider than for you to remain and be someone that doesn\u2019t show up regularly. I will even provide you recommendations if you like\u2014-a few have even come running back begging for me to take them back and never miss again).\n\nTraining that front though on how and when to be flexible and understanding is crucial to the whole process though.\n\nI will also say this cancellation problem has become 5-7x worse since 2020. People have become so jaded from the stress of the pandemic and the shit customer service breakdown across the board that they are more readily not caring about being considerate themselves to places like their dental office.

I\u2019d suggest looking into medical billing and coding for oral healthcare. \n\nThere\u2019s such a lack of knowledge in this area at practices and most dentists are afraid to tackle medical insurance/suggest the patient to do it. \n\nThere are lots of CPT that are mirror to CDT codes beyond implants or bone grafting etc. Even restorations are truly considered prosthetics. \n\nDental care is not an essential benefit, but congenital defects are and habilitation services for functional impairment. Someone with a peg lateral has a birth defect so a crown is considered prosthetic intervention and can be argued to medical insurance that the primary purpose is to correct congenital defects. \n\nAt this point you wouldn\u2019t even need to have a contract with the insurance yet because you can have patients petition you in network under network gap exception. There\u2019s no other dentist, perio, or pros doing this so the network doesn\u2019t have a provider. You then can work with a rep or have the patient ask about the max allowable amounts to figure out your rates. \n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s also just preventative services, X-rays, cbct scans, services related to dental caries that all have icd-10 codes and cpt codes. \n\nThe reason why I\u2019m suggesting this as a business opportunity.

We highly recommend VoIP.ms, an established telecommunications provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers. The VoIP.ms team is ready to help and has taken several steps to make sure things are seamless for you. We believe VoIP.ms will provide you with excellent service, customer support, and competitive rates.\n\nWith that said, we understand you might have pressing questions concerning your account, the reason we are shutting down operations and billing issues. We have prepared some\u00a0questions and answers\u00a0we believe are more urgent concerning this matter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGeneral Questions\n\nQ: Why is VoIPo ceasing operations?\u00a0\n\nA: Due to challenging market conditions, significant financial losses, and a key vendor disrupting our ability to process credit cards or issue refunds, we can no longer operate. This was a hard and difficult decision made after exploring all available options.\n\nQ: When exactly does my VoIPo service end?\n\nA: All VoIPo telecommunications services will permanently cease on August 6th, 2025 at 11:59PM EST.\n\nQ: What if I have billing or other questions about my old VoIPo account?\n\nA: VoIPo will provide limited support through closing via e-mail at\u00a0support@voipo.com.\n\nQ: When should I start migrating to another provider?\n\nA: Immediately. The sooner you begin, the smoother your transition will be, otherwise you might suffer longer service interruptions.\n\nQ: What do I do with my VoIPo adapter?\n\nA: VoIPo is not requiring the return of any equipment. You may use the equipment with VoIP.ms (or any other provider) if they support it or dispose of/recycle it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMigration to VoIP.ms Questions\n\nQ: Can VoIP.ms access my VoIPo account to help?\n\nA: No. VoIP.ms cannot access your VoIPo account information or resolve VoIPo-related issues.\n\nQ: Why is VoIPo recommending VoIP.ms?\n\nA: VoIP.ms is a well-established provider with over 15 years of experience with residential and business phone systems, as well as VoIP resellers, excellent service quality, competitive pricing, and the technical capability to handle VoIPo customer migrations smoothly. Learn more about VoIP.ms right here:\u00a0https://migration.voip.ms/voipo.\n\nQ: Will VoIP.ms honor VoIPo's rates/contracts?\n\nA: No. VoIP.ms operates independently with their own pricing and terms. However, their rates are competitive and often lower than industry standards. See\u00a0https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost\u00a0and\u00a0https://voip.ms/pricing.\u00a0\n\nQ: Will my current equipment work with VoIP.ms?\n\nA: Most equipment will work with VoIP.ms, but will need reconfiguration (ie. factory reset). VoIP.ms built this extensive knowledgebase article to help you out:\u00a0https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Migrating_from_VoIPo_to_VoIP.ms.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nTechnical Questions\n\nQ: Can I keep my phone numbers?\n\nA: Yes. Your phone numbers can be ported to VoIP.ms. Start the porting process before August 6th to avoid any complications.\n\nQ: How long does number porting take?\n\nA: VoIP.ms will coordinate this process and keep you informed of the timeline. VoIP.ms will expedite any number porting to ensure minimal downtime (eg. 1-2 business days).\n\nQ: What if I have technical problems with my current VoIPo service?\n\nA: VoIPo technical support is limited during the closure period. For ongoing service, we recommend beginning your migration to VoIP.ms as soon as possible.\n\nQ: Will there be any service interruption during migration?\n\nA: VoIP.ms will work to minimize downtime during number porting.\n\n\u00a0\n\nVoIP.ms Specific Questions\n\nQ: What if VoIP.ms can't help with my VoIPo account issue?\n\nA: VoIP.ms cannot access VoIPo accounts or resolve VoIPo billing/service issues. Contact us directly at\u00a0support@voipo.com\u00a0for VoIPo-related matters.\n\nQ: How much will VoIP.ms service cost?\n\nA: VoIP.ms uses transparent pay-as-you-go pricing. Rates start as low as $0.85/month with no hidden fees.\u00a0See\u00a0https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Service_Cost\u00a0and\u00a0https://voip.ms/pricing.\n\nQ: Does VoIP.ms offer the same features as VoIPo?\n\nA: VoIP.ms offers similar and often more advanced features.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\nVoIPo Team\n\nEmail sent to:\nsofar+voipo@foo-projects.org\n\nVOIPO LLC\n602-19 Spectrum Pointe Drive\u00a0|\u00a0Lake Forest, California\u00a0|\u00a092630\u00a0|\u00a0United States\u00a0|\u00a0support@voipo.com\n\nAnti\u2011spam policy\u00a0|\u00a0Report\u00a0an\u00a0abuse\u00a0|\u00a0Unsubscribe", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1754073796, "created_utc": 1754073796, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "n6eb9jg", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1mezs0r", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_n6eb9jg", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1mezs0r", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1mezs0r/voipo_eoleos_update/n6eb9jg/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1754073815, "saved": false, "score": 5, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 5, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-08-01"}

I get that what you're saying is The Way It Is; I've had a worm's-eye-view of the process of reactivating and then transferring a 'dead' telco number myself. But one of the nice things about being a fiction writer is that you get to re-write the rules occasionally. So, here's my Final Answer:\n\n* Late February: The telco places a cell tower in service which is supposed to extend coverage for this rural area. They send techs out to verify signal strength, and then to notify customers that wired POTS is being discontinued as of March 31st and \"such a deal I have for you!\" on wireless voice and Internet.\n* The telco's current terms of service require one full month's notification for cancellation by the service provider. But due to inclement winter weather, the techs are a couple days late showing up to the last customer site (my characters' sawmill) and don't deliver the notice until March 3rd.\n* My characters pay the March bill on time and in full for service through the end of April.\n* The discontinuance of POTS is not just because they're tired of servicing those few rural holdouts, it's because they have a failed switch in a major metro area and customers there are screaming. This switch out in the boonies is the most eligible to be repurposed. So they cut the power and the wires and truck it out of there on its way to Charlotte on April the 15th.\n* Since my characters were not given required notice under the ToS and since the bill is paid, the number is not canceled right away. They're able to port their number over before it's officially canceled after the required month's notice.\n\nYes, I know that I'm overthinking this, but I like to respect my subject matter and my audience, even (especially!) teens/kids. So for those with experience in the field, I know it's a stretch...but if I can get my audience to accept a telekinetic teenager on the run from a psychic Deep State operative while a shapeshifting billionairess plots designs on them both...a screwed up telco shouldn't be too much to swallow...!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1735234200, "created_utc": 1735234200, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m3wgjtx", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1hman86", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m3wgjtx", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_m3w6ci8", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1hman86/how_long_to_port_a_number_after_phone_company/m3wgjtx/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1735234223, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-12-26"}

I would like to use the VoIP ethernet connection I have set up. I researched this a couple of years ago and liked the SNOM phones (like the D735). I would like to get to a cheaper VoIP service where they can't steal my phone number from me (I have heard that Nextiva and Google Voice have done this to people). I don't need fancy features for VoIP service, just unlimited (or a high minute number) minutes, ability to forward to my cellphone when I don't answer my desk phone, and VM I guess. Open to VoIP provider and phone maker suggestions.

Unfortunately we cannot remove 911 service from your account/service. If we did not charge a fee, we would likely have to shut FreePhoneLine service down all together as it does not make sense for us to absorb increasing fees to provide free services. \n\n> \n\n>We recognize that adjustments to your bill may not be ideal, but there is no contract that states you will receive free-to-use phone service indefinitely. The service is subject to change and there is no penalty for cancelling service. We have provided more than 60 days notice for you to make other arrangements should you disagree with this change.\n\n> \n\n>The CRTC makes it a legal obligation for VoIP providers like FreePhoneLine to provide 911 service:\n\n>[https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/911/can.htm](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/911/can.htm)\n\n>[https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/911/voip.htm](https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/911/voip.htm)\n\n> \n\n>With VoIP service (even if it's just the fax line like your case), we're not able to know your location when you make a call, therefore we must use a third party 911 service that will answer your call and verify your location (ask you or if unresponsive, lookup your 911 address in your account) then transfer your call to the correct area for emergency service dispatch. The costs of this third party\u2019s services have risen to unforeseen levels due to the rapid inflation we have had in recent years. It's no longer financially viable to provide free 911 service. Your unlimited calling is still free, but 911 has become expensive and we're legally required to provide you with it.\n\n> \n\n>You are not in any kind of contract with FreePhoneLine for your phone service.

The way our network is set up is we have every CAT5 cable coming down a pipe in the cieling that goes into a patch panel on our track, then from the patch panel into two Netgear switches (oddly, all phones just happen to be on our top netgear switch, just somehow worked out that way to use the PoE function), then from the switches, it goes into a Ubiquiti Edge Router X, then to our Fiber ONT (which is in bridge mode so I can control the network better via the Edge Router X). So ill poke around in the Edge router to see if there is any multicasting configuratings I can set up to get that working. Looking around on the further with the VOIP Server we are using, they do not seem to have anything on their end for that and their tech support DID tell us - its something where the phones need to be configured for that - not the server side. So it would have the be the latter to take a look into.\n\n  \nFor the second part of your comment, same answer from the VOIP service - it has to be set up via the phones, not the server side. The DND function IS native to the phone. The 3rd menu function button on all phones is \"DND\".  Now, how you explained it on the server side of things - this is exactly what I figured what was going on. I put my phone in DND, and no other phone sees it, my thought was \"Well, the server isnt TELLING the other phones \"That person is in DND right now\" because...it doesnt know. Its not sending that information of DND from the phone, to the server, then back to our location to tell the other 3 phones. But this is where I get confused because it DOES WORK as far as being on calls or being free. The server is clearly telling the other 3 phones, that 1 phone is currently on the line with someone. So why DND won't work? Puzzling me - which prompted me to come here to ask \"What on earth is going on!?\" LOL \n\nNow, I did leave something out in my OP that I felt wasn't necessary, but maybe itll help work out in the end. We recently switched ISPs. We were using Comcast for years with traditional cable internet/phone and we wanted fiber. Not to digress too much here but Comcast was our only option here in our industrial complex because the landlords son apparently had some relationship to comcast and wouldnt allow another ISP? IDK, even the landlord was like \"um what? Im not aware of that\" but who knows, thats what this NEW ISP told us which is a Fiber ISP (Bluestream Fiber, I use them for residential and theyre amazing and their tech support is great I can nerd out to shit with them). Enough digressing, this is what prompted us to move our phone systems to this. Our final set up appointment is tomorrow. We did decline to use one of their phones they would lease to use which was Polyfon? (probably spelt that wrong), we wanted more options and they said any VOIP phone works and it saves money on the bill if you just buy your own. Ill be honest, these Fanvils are AWESOME in my opinion. The service will actualyl be through them but we wanted to learn the phones oursevles so we can troubleshoot them ourselves when things go down. Its why we manage our own network, and its why were doing things this route with the phones aswell. So VOIPStudio just happened to have a free 30 day trial where we can atleast test them. Maybe with BlueStream, itll all be different? We don't know. Well know tomorrow when the tech comes in to finish the job and hell know how to have THAT part set up properly. Since im pretty IT savuy, I just wanted the tech to come in, put in what he needed, and be on his way because 95% of the work for him was already done but well consult with him on how to get everything we want to work on the phones which is only the 2 things mentioned and go from there. We're just worried because we didnt get their leased phones, he might not know, hence coming here.\n\nBut thank you SO MUCH for the info, im gonna do some more deep diving today on this", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1721316007, "created_utc": 1721316007, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lds7x30", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1e5sz41", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lds7x30", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_ldpieaz", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1e5sz41/help_a_newbie_please_extension_monitoring/lds7x30/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1721316020, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["positive"], "_date": "2024-07-18"}

We do it all the time using SIP Trunking (Telnyx, Twilio, VoIP Innovations, etc) and a server running FreePBX. SIP Trunking is where a provider sells a service to connect a computer/server PBX to telephone lines. There are many providers for SIP Trunking and many different hosted PBX platforms, but we find FreePBX to be simple and many features. A PBX is a computer/server/appliance that operates a physical phone system and contains all your programming, to make your extensions/apps/phones connect and pass that on to the SIP Trunking provider. Then we add a mobile app called SangomaTalk (aka Sangoma Connect). There are many softphone/mobile apps that you can use also (Linphone comes to mind if you want a free one or your provider doesn\u2019t have a branded app), but we have found the ease of setup, security, and call quality on SangomaTalk to be superior to others in our testing on our equipment. \n\nThe USA companies I mentioned above also operate internationally and with international numbers, but someone can maybe point you to a German provider than can do the same for a better rate and better matching your needs/taxes/etc. \n\nHowever, what you are asking for is extremely simple and should be available in any Cloud PBX offering. A cloud PBX is often sold with the SIP Trunking and PBX together as a single purchase. Everything is in the cloud, so you don\u2019t buy any equipment. And it is priced per extension. \n\nYou need:\n\n1 phone number (often called a DID)\n1 inbound route (programs what happens on PBX when DID called - points to ring group)\n1 ring group (can ring all extensions simultaneously, sequentially, etc)\n3 extensions (this is usually what you pay for when you setup this kind of service $/mo/ext)\n\nThen decide what happens to unanswered calls. This is setup in the ring group. I assume they go to a single voicemail if all 3 extensions miss the call. But the unanswered call could also go to an automated attendant (press 1, 2, 3 system) and then go to multiple voicemails or different places based on the digit pressed by the caller. \n\nOutbound calls for each extension will just be setup to show your main number. This is called CNAM (caller name and number). Some providers refer to this as caller id masking but that is really an improper use of that term with VoIP and more refers to when people have multiple copper telephone lines. \n3 extensions (and, 3 mobile apps free or licensed)\n\nIf the app is proprietary then they will just send you a link to click on and setup is usually automatic. If you use a free app, then you\u2019ll have a server address, username, and password to enter in the app. \n\nWhen you receive a call it will ring in the mobile app (this is a SIP client that works just like a desk phone). You would have options like answering calls, transferring between extensions, hold, conference, transfer to outside number, recording, etc. When you place an outbound call you just use the app and people will see your business name and number (CNAM) on their caller id. \n\nThe cost for this is commonly about $35usd per extension in USA. But you could find providers for a simple system like this under $15/mo or over $50/mo per extension. \n\nHope this helps. I don\u2019t want to claim knowledge about what provider to use in Germany, someone else will know better or a google search. But hope these terms and configuration details help you get a system setup more easily. \n\nI told you my hosting setup because that\u2019s how it is done on the back side. But with only 3 extensions, you probably want a company that will do all that for you and just bill by the extension. That way you don\u2019t have anything complicated to design, program, maintain, or keep secure. \n\nBased on your description, you\u2019ll love this setup. But, all your phones will need basic reliable internet (cellular or wifi) to make/receive calls. If the internet is fast enough to browse the web, you\u2019ll be fine on the speed. But, it must be reliable and not spotty or you\u2019ll have poor call quality or dropped calls. \n\nGood luck!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1715457143, "created_utc": 1715457143, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l3m6ymb", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1cpew5m", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l3m6ymb", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1cpew5m", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1cpew5m/multiple_mobile_phones_for_1_number/l3m6ymb/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1715457157, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_switched", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-05-11"}

Even during the business hours the person answering the chat works for some BPO. Even calling their advertised support number and trying to get a certain department you will most likely be answered by tier 1 support who doesn't actually work in that department (E.g. selecting LNP option and still getting the same person who couldn't help during a chat session).\n\nTheir first line of support will chat will with their internal team and then just read back what the internal team wrote, clearly not understanding what they're actually saying. I guess it's better than nothing, but still not great. Any time I need to actually get something done I just automatically call my account rep to get it escalated. Urgency doesn't seem to register with support chat. They will just say some canned response like \"the team is working on it.\"\n\nI used to have thousands of numbers with them, but switched to another carrier a couple of years ago. Mostly used Telnyx for a few services and a backup for outbound. Too many call quality issues that would constantly need route updates. When you're managing thousands of end users, you really don't have time to constantly supply call samples  only for them to wait past 72 hours and then have them ask for another one. I moved to another carrier and have had almost zero issues with call quality since (at least as far as carrier related issues!). Makes life a lot easier not getting inundated with tickets from customers to then have to troubleshoot at the local network level with another IT company and then to go to Telnyx for support and ask them to fix. \n\nI want to be fair to Telnyx and say they do have some useful features. Debugging/Call reports work well mostly. Access to invoices is easy. Setting up different SIP trunks and outbound profiles is simple. \n\nThe biggest issues I had with Telnyx:  \n-Numbers were given to another Telnyx without any notification. Months went by until the customer brought to my attention that one of their spare numbers didn't work. It was active in my account and was being charged the whole time. Support couldn't explain why it was in 2 different customer accounts and wouldn't give it back. This was part of a customers block of 100 DID's that they ported in a couple years before that. Customer didn't put p much of a fight so I gave up trying to get a resolution.   \n-Numbers were ported away without notification for months while still being charged and marked as \"active\" in my account.  \n-Needed to work out billing issues in which Telnyx had to refund thousands of dollars for. We had to bring this to their attention and their response time isn't very good.   \n-Too many call quality issues. Switching our traffic to another carrier was the only real resolution for us. It wasn't the ISP, it wasn't the LAN. Too many of the same symptoms across too many customers. All resolved by switching carriers.\n\nI suppose it's normal for a company to have tickets get lost in the mix sometimes. I assume they get overwhelmed by customer complaints like anyone else would. But it's hard to get things escalated when there's a legit issue (example, customers number ring busy or calls cannot complete intermittently). We don't have insight on how their support team is actually handling things.

The first, and easiest ask would be \"do they(the university, presumably) have any form of call forwarding for your analog line?\" Chances are they do, and you'd just have to enable that-because this is all it sounds like you're trying to do. Now, whether they'll allow this is a separate story. It's also possible, even likely, that whatever phone system they're using to provide service has an app you can install on your phone. If that's the case, there would almost always be some setup you'd have to do.\n\nIt is 99% likely that your phone line is VOIP, in that it travels over computer networks, but by the time it gets to your dorm is turned back into analog signal. This means that someone at university who runs the phone systems almost certainly has the ability to do this-whether they have the inclination(or permission) is a whole different story. \n\nAs for adding your phone line to Unifi Talk, that's basically a no. Unifi, like any provider, can only provide service to numbers they own, and it's exceedingly unlikely you'll be able to tell the university to transfer your number to them. You can initiate a transfer of ownership from a number you pay for and manage, but I get the impression you're not receiving a bill for this in your name. \n\n  \nYour first step should be to reach out to the IT department at your university.

If not, then provide a solution that does not require changing providers. If it is indeed the only way to do it within that ecosystem, say \"Unfortunately, while overkill, your current solution is the only way to do this with your current provider.

I have actually done this before with ABC123, and found that Setting Y caused problems with Service K. Make sure you read the documentation at link\\_to\\_website or you will have a bad time.\"\n\nHere is a bad reply:\n\n\"You should use ABC123 for this. XYZ and Provider W also work, but I find ABC123 has really good pricing and customer support\"\n\nOne of them answers the question (\"Which can be integrated?\") while also giving helpful insight (\"some settings misbehave\"). The other answers the question but in a biased way, and instead of giving helpful *technical* insight, promotes one option over another.\n\nIf on the other hand you think ABC123 is a *bad* choice you are free to do so if you clearly articulate the specific challenges that came with *doing exactly the same thing as the OP*. Simply saying \"I wouldn't use ABC123 because they incorrectly billed me for three months in a row\" would be a violation of the rules because while incorrect billing is a risk of doing business with ABC123, it is not a risk that is *unique* to ABC123 in a technical sense. On the other hand, saying \"I wouldn't use ABC123 because their API requires PHP, which has limitations X,Y,Z that might interfere with your planned deployment\" is fine, because the API requiring PHP (vs, say, Python for Provider W) is a legitimate and *unique* technical difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If that's the case, in all honesty, what can we talk about here? \n\nYou can sort the subreddit by \"New\" you'll see plenty of posts and comments that don't break the rules.

I don\u2019t wanna talk to sales! lol\u2026 I\u2019d pay $50-$100 a month for support one step up where someone personally gets assigned my ticket and works it and follows up daily until resolved. And not those automated updates that are like \u201cHey we\u2019re working on your issue\u201d\u2026 IMHO that response is trash and just pisses me off! They don\u2019t count as a response to me at all, they just irritate me and remind me I have an open ticket that will probably never ever get human eyes on it again. \n\nMy opinion and recommendation would be to focus and track one call close metrics, and work on that metric a lot! Then there would be no follow up issues, but why not do LIVE escalations on the tickets? Try hard for that one call close please! i realize that\u2019s isn\u2019t always possible but damn I\u2019ve asked some dead simple questions, that result in let me get back to you, and then it dies. Your beat chance for \u201cgreat\u201d service is one call close imo! \n\nI think i\u2019ll just enter all my future tickets as P1\u2019s and see if that helps! Although support will just likely knock it down to P4, where i feel like it just dies lol. But hey worth a shot? I use that tactic often with premium aws support and it works \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f!   I get my answer asap haha \n\nI like that you responded, i actually thought that wouldn\u2019t happen and i\u2019d be asking for new vendor recommendations! But i appreciate the outreach, but yea still I think your \u201cSupport is trash\u201d to be honest! nothing changed my mind yet\u2026", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1684283075, "created_utc": 1684283075, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jkfrt2v", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_13jaykz", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jkfrt2v", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_13jaykz", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/13jaykz/telnyx_support_is_trash/jkfrt2v/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1687823334, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-05-17"}

Let me clarify:\n\nThere's 2 things I want to know:\n\n- How in general consultants tackle multiple clients and is my situation unqiue or are there other approaches (i.e you secure contract work that is billed per devliberable/project instead of daily rates comes to my mind.. as then you can just focus on the deliverable instead of billable hours and you don't need to worry how you juggle things as long as the work is done or what you suggested.. tracking 20 hours or however much your worked and saying you're unavailable the rest of the day etc. if you have work with another client or some 3rd approach which i dont know about etc.)\n\nI'm asking this quesiton because either I'm doing something wrong or I have unrealistic expecations for what actually is consultant work, so I needed more clarity on that. If my situation is pretty standard and most clients need you to be dedicated the typical 40hours per week and you're billed per hours worked on their project then consultancy is probably not for me as I'd rather get the benefits of being a fulltime employee. For me the idea of consultancy is to be able to offer a service and have multiple clients (as long as you can deliver to all of them) and not be billed on hours worked but rather on results and deliverables, in fact you should be rewarded if you can deliver something faster with the same quality.\n\n- The second question is regarding my specific scenario which to be honest is also not fully clear to me... I haven't actually started work on the project. On the one side we're talking about a project that is say 9months long fixed-term with a target deliverable, on the other side they want me to track billable hours and pay me on that. \n\nI'm sorry but if I'm ready with all deliverables at the 3 month mark, why would i deliver it then if im being payed by the hour? Wether I stretch my work hours to be longer to collect a full pay check, or just be a perfectionist so everything takes me twice as long, there is no incentive to actually complete the work as fast as possible.This is why I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. \n\nWhat you said if I do have a second client is what I'll do - be upfront about it with the first hour and tell them I won't be available for meetings with them if I'm already busy and in meetings with the second client OR if they're really expecting me to be 8hours dedicated all day to them I'll simply decline any adittional clients as I wouldn't have the capacity for both and I'll probably look for another altenrative path in the future.. either billing per project or something else.\n\nMy intention is not to short any client, that's the whole point of the post, if I wanted to do that I wouldn't be asking for permission or discussing it online, it's more so to understand if this is typical or if I'm missing something and how to achive what my goal is if it's not possible with my current contract work.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1743537084, "created_utc": 1743537084, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "mkwqp8h", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1joysot", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_mkwqp8h", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_mkvhdsf", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1joysot/how_do_you_handle_multiple_clients_timetracking/mkwqp8h/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1743537100, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_not_ready"], "_date": "2025-04-01"}

I went ahead and asked ChatGPT for you. Consider yourself consulted:\n\n\nTo launch a successful AI consulting firm, here\u2019s a structured approach addressing your questions:\n\n1. Choose High-Ticket AI Consulting Services\n\n\t\u2022\tAI Strategy Development: Guide clients in understanding and adopting AI to transform their operations. This service often commands premium rates as it targets C-level executives.\n\t\u2022\tCustom AI Solutions: Build end-to-end AI systems tailored to specific client needs, like predictive modeling, automation, and optimization. Tailored solutions have higher value as they address unique client pain points.\n\t\u2022\tData Science and Analytics: Offer advanced analytics, including predictive analysis, anomaly detection, and customer insights.\n\t\u2022\tML and AI Training: Upskill client teams to leverage in-house AI capabilities. This can lead to long-term, high-ticket retainers.\n\t\u2022\tAI Implementation and Maintenance: Ongoing support and monitoring ensure client systems stay optimized, allowing for recurring revenue.\n\n2. How to Get Clients\n\n\t\u2022\tNetworking: Attend industry events, conferences, and online meetups to connect with potential clients. Partner with firms that offer complementary services.\n\t\u2022\tThought Leadership: Publish insights, whitepapers, and case studies to build credibility. Contribute to AI publications, LinkedIn, and industry blogs.\n\t\u2022\tReferrals and Partnerships: Build relationships with other firms, especially in tech and consulting. Often, larger firms outsource specialized AI work.\n\t\u2022\tCold Outreach: Identify target clients (mid-to-large firms in sectors like finance, healthcare, and retail) and reach out through email or LinkedIn with personalized value propositions.\n\n3. Billing Structure\n\n\t\u2022\tHourly Billing: Common for open-ended projects. Rates for specialized AI consulting can range from $150 to $400+ per hour, depending on the complexity.\n\t\u2022\tProject-Based Billing: Define a project scope and set a fixed price. This model works well for defined deliverables, offering predictability for both you and the client.\n\t\u2022\tRetainer Model: Charge a recurring monthly fee for ongoing support and maintenance. Retainers build long-term client relationships and ensure stable cash flow.\n\t\u2022\tValue-Based Pricing: For high-impact projects, bill based on the estimated value you\u2019re delivering. This can significantly increase profitability but requires experience in scoping client ROI.\n\n4. Compensation for Employees\n\n\t\u2022\tBase Salary: For skilled AI talent, average annual salaries range from $120k to $200k+ for experienced engineers.\n\t\u2022\tEquity Options: Especially in early stages, offering 0.5\u20132% equity can attract top talent and foster long-term commitment. It\u2019s also a cost-effective way to compete with larger firms on compensation.\n\t\u2022\tBonuses: Offer performance-based bonuses tied to project milestones or firm revenue goals. This can motivate employees without the immediate cash outlay.\n\nNet Profit Margins in Consulting\n\nAI consulting firms typically target a net profit margin between 20-30%, given the higher rates and lower overhead costs (especially in a remote-friendly model).", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1729994122, "created_utc": 1729994122, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lty31v2", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1gd0dcq", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lty31v2", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1gd0dcq", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1gd0dcq/i_want_to_start_a_ai_consulting_firm/lty31v2/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1729994137, "saved": false, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 6, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-10-27"}

Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts \u2014 GWACs, as they\u2019re affectionately known \u2014 allow agencies to issue task orders to pre-vetted companies without going through the full procurement process, but also tend to lock out companies that didn\u2019t get on the bandwagon originally. According to USASpending.gov, CGI Federal got a total of $678 million for various services under the contract \u2014 including the $93.7 million Healthcare.gov job, which CGI Federal won over three other companies in late 2011.\nIt\u2019s also true that CGI Federal began lobbying as it started winning government work. According to OpenSecrets.org, it has spent $800,000 since 2006 lobbying on several different tax and appropriations bills. That\u2019s nothing, though, compared to the many millions of dollars deployed by heavy hitters like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon.*\n\nCan\u2019t be an IT contractor without doing a little bit of lobbying. (OpenSecrets)\nWhat exactly were they responsible for?\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to a June report from the Government Accountability Office, a total of 55 contractors were retained to work on the rollout of the federal health-care marketplace. CGI Federal was the primary one, and had received $88 million out of the $394 million that had been spent at that point (the next biggest recipient got $55 million). Along with building sites for the states that elected to participate in the federal marketplace, it\u2019s in charge of knitting all the pieces together, making Quality Software Services\u2019 data hub work seamlessly with Development Seed\u2019s sleek user interface and Oracle\u2019s identity management software \u2014 or \u201cdesigning an IT solution that is adaptable and modular to accommodate the implementation of additional functional requirements and services,\u201d as CGI Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell put it in a September hearing on the progress of the site.\nShare this article\nNo subscription required to read\nShare\n\nWhat exactly went wrong?\nThat is a matter of some disagreement. And the answer isn\u2019t necessarily that CGI is wholly responsible.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSome people think that the system was underfunded: Donald Berwick, who administered the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2010 and 2011, says the site failed because they didn\u2019t have enough money to build it from the start. Others point fingers at the Department of Health and Human Services, which took years to issue final specifications, preventing CGI from really getting started until this spring.\nEither way, it\u2019s clear that the site itself isn\u2019t well constructed: IT professionals told the Wall Street Journal that in addition to specific pieces not working, the whole thing was \u201cbuilt on a sloppy software foundation,\u201d potentially due to the haste with which code was written. Slate described just how difficult it is to coordinate multiple contractors creating different components of a complex Web portal.\nEvan Burfield, who founded the relatively small company that worked with CGI to build Recovery.gov, says the problem lies more in a federal procurement apparatus that makes it nearly impossible for an agile newcomer to bid on projects that in the private sector would take much less time and money. Plus, with so many contractors, everyone could technically fulfill the requirements in their statement of work, and the thing can still not work in the end.\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIf it had been a $4 million Web site, it would\u2019ve had higher likelihood of being a success,\u201d Burfield says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just CGI. It\u2019s any collection of government contractors, if you put them together, will find a way to put together something complex enough to justify $400 million.\u201d\nEven though White House technology officials like Todd Park understand the value of lean development and have taken steps to open the procurement system to smaller companies, the overall structure of contracting rules would require an act of Congress to change.\nWhat\u2019s it like inside the company these days? \nThe healthcare.gov debacle has taken its toll on the working environment at CGI Federal\u2019s 10-story complex in Fairfax, Va., according to a staffer working on a related project who asked not to be named. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of agitation and anger, because CGI really prides itself on having family flexibility,\u201d he said, noting the firm\u2019s liberal telework policy. Instead, the Obamacare contract has sucked more and more staff off other projects, and people have been working around the clock to first get the site ready for Oct. 1, and then fix it when things started to go wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of frustration,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cPeople are getting sick, fainting in conference calls.\u201d\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThat\u2019s only an escalation in an already unstable work environment. The firm has grown very quickly and turnover is high, as people get poached by larger contractors that can pay higher salaries, the staffer said. Offices sometimes have more contractors than full-fledged staff \u2014 which makes things difficult when you\u2019re putting together a project that requires as much specialized knowledge as a health-care exchange.\nOne thing is clear, though: CGI\u2019s leadership is really excited about the health-care work, and wants everyone to think it\u2019s going okay. Last week, they held an annual meeting with a dinner reception at a nearby Marriott. \u201cThey addressed some of the health-care exchange things that people have been hearing on the news,\u201d the staffer recalled. \u201cVague things about how health care is changing in the U.S. and how CGI is going to be at the forefront of that. \u2018You guys have probably heard some stuff, but this is indicative of any huge rollout of any project.\u2019 \u201c\nA CGI spokeswoman declined to comment on the staffer\u2019s observations.\nHow\u2019s the market reacting to it? \nPretty well actually! Here\u2019s the one-month chart from the New York Stock Exchange:\n\n(NASDAQ)\nCGI Group\u2019s stock has been on the upswing since its huge acquisition of Logica, which added $3 billion in market cap. And it hasn\u2019t been punished much by the negative press in recent weeks, either. TD Bank Securities research sent the following note to clients:\n\u201cOur concern was that CGI (as a main contractor on the federal health exchange) would be linked in a negative way to exchange difficulties. This by and large has not happened \u2013 there is no indication that CGI failed to deliver on its commitments \u2014 and the stock is up 4% since Oct. 1 (when enrollment in exchanges began).\u201d\nBecause of how federal contracting works, it\u2019s also unlikely that CGI will be less competitive on bids in the futur", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1723086624, "created_utc": 1723086624, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lh1tp6j", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1emt8nn", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lh1tp6j", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_lh1tnl4", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1emt8nn/need_advice_on_starting_in_consulting/lh1tp6j/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1723086640, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service bill", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-08-08"}

I've noticed that many people have discouraged you from pursuing your idea. Here's my recommendation: take every single reason you were given for why it  wouldn't work and find solid answers for each one.\n\nFor instance, someone says you don't have a niche, then find one. If someone mentions your lack of experience, know  that if you can master a concept well enough to offer value to a business, they'll pay for it...bottom line...The means to the end don't matter as much as the end itself...especially in this internent age where one can quickly master a topic..at least compared to decades ago... I could go on and on, but you get my point. Regardless of the idea you pursue, someone will tell you it won't work. So, instead of moving on to the next thing, find answers to each of those points and keep moving forward.\n\nThat being said, if you can't find satisfactory answers or workarounds to why something won't work, especially when it comes from smart people, and I see many of them responded to you, then maybe your idea needs A LOT of refinement and you need to go back to the drawing board. But, as I mentioned, expect to keep hearing \"it won't work.\" I'm sure Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs all received thier fair share of \"it wont work\", but they persevered, adapted, and found solutions to the challenges they faced.\n\nNow if  you do decide to pursue your consulting idea and develop a valuable service or product, you might want to explore this platform that connects [small businessess](https://consultantvue.co/small-business-consulting/) with  independent consultants.

At the same time, you have to invest time and effort in acquisition, because client contracts eventually end. But maybe the client want to keep you around and has another project for you ... now you have to somehow clone yourself, because you have two clients demanding your time. Or, you bet that the client will extend your contract, and he doesn't, so you're suddenly left with no client, no project and no income until you can acquire the next one. \n\n2) The middlemen - It's almost impossible for a small consultancy to get a direct contract with a corporation. Most medium-sized and almost all large companies have a \"preferred provider\" list of suppliers, and are very unwilling to onboard additional suppliers, especially small consultancies. So you end up having to sub-contract under one of the existing suppliers (usually one of the big consultancies or a recruiting agency). That costs you between 15% and 25% off the top. I did this for 5 years (I was a partner in a boutique), and the other company was earning \u20ac300 per day for the work I was delivering - \u20ac1,500 per week, 46 weeks per year = \u20ac69,000 per year for writing an occasional SoW to the client and issuing an invoice every month. (And they managed to fuck those up massively, even though I had recorded my working hours every day in their own SAP CATS time tracking system). \n\n3) The payment delay - Most clients will try to push out the invoice payments as long as possible. You can ask for net 30, but they'll try to get you to accept net 90. Even if you do manage to get agreement for net 45, it's usually between 60 and 90 days before the money hits your bank account. So, if you do work in April, you issue the invoice on May 2nd, and if you're lucky, you'll have the money in July, but in reality, it'll probably be early August. I used to work for a client who paid its bills after 120 days - their attitude was, \"if you don't like it, too bad. If you don't want to wait for your money, then go find another client, because we've got a dozen other consultancies waiting to go to work for us.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday, I am in an industry management position - and I understand the situation a bit better. We also have \"qualified suppliers\" and it's a major pain-in-the-ass to get a new supplier on-boarded. It takes about 4 to 8 weeks for a supplier to be qualified by the sourcing department, then they have to issue a change ticket to get the new supplier added to the ERP system (master data changes are executed by the IT department). The qualification process includes a long questionnaire, credit checks, and (for some critical parts) an on-site vendor audit before the supplier can be qualified.

One that is easy done with [voip.ms](https://voip.ms)\n\nThe cost of voip.ms is incredibly low, and configurability is awesome. There's a reason they are dominant in this field. They charge per use/per minute, but at a rate of like 0.005$ - 0.009$ per minute (half a penny to a penny per minute). There is no \"per-extension\" cost. It's all shared minutes. So very cost effective. There is no monthly fee, it's just whatever you pre-pay.\n\nThe only downside to [voip.ms](https://voip.ms) that it's a self-service system, and customer service is only available through chat -- but they are very knowledgeable and helpful and once you get going, it's not hard at all to understand how things work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow is from what I recall and there are likely subtleties, but overall each of these steps is pretty straightforward to do on the web portal.\n\nIf you have problems, you can simply ask the online customer service rep to help you out. If you really need additional technical help, I can probably help (DM me). I can probably get you up and running within 2 hours or so (max 3).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 1 - Register** a voip.ms account. Note your 6-digit account #, ex: \"345678\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 2 - Finances -> Add funds** to the account (eg: 15$ to start).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 3 - Transfer your existing office phone number to** [**voip.ms**](https://voip.ms)**.** (if this will be a new number aka new office, skip this step).  You will have to take a picture of your current carrier's invoice showing your name, address, account number, and phone number, to identify you;  on the same page write, by hand, \"please port this number to voip.ms\" and then sign. It will take about 10 days for the request to complete.  **Go to DID Numbers -> DID Portability** and follow instructions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 4: DID Numbers -> Order DID(s) :** Register 1 new DID (aka: phone number). This will be a temporary number you will use to set up your office while your previous number is being ported over (or this new DID will become your actual number if you didn't have one before).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 5:  Sub-Accounts -> Create Sub Account.**  Create 5 sub-accounts (1 sub account per co-worker).  These will look like: \"345678\\_JIM\", \"345678\\_BOB\", etc.  When you create these subaccounts.  Assign voice mail number 101 through 105. By default (which is what you want) each sub-account will be assigned the DID you got in step 4, so all outgoing calls made by all co-workers via VOIP will look like they are coming from your office number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 6 (optional, but nice): DID Numbers -> Ring Groups -> Create new ring group.** Name this ring group \"everyone\" -- and in the ring group, select the 5 sub-accounts you just created. This feature will allow everyone to receive a ring if a caller selects an option to speak to  \"the first available lawyer\". Everybody's phone will ring, the first one to pick up wins the call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 7: Record an auto-answer message**. On your computer using an app of your choice, record a MP3  saying: *\"Welcome to our offices. To reach Jim, press 1. Bob 2 \\[..\\] If you are a new customer and would like to speak to a lawyer, press 0\".*  Save this MP3 to your desktop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 8: DID Numbers -> Recordings -> Upload a recording.**  Select the file on your desktop and press upload. Name this recording \"welcome message\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 9: DID Numbers -> Digital Receptionist (IVR).** Create a new IVR.  Select the \"welcome message\" you just uploaded for the audio.  For options, type digit \"1\" - and route this to JIM's subaccount.  For digit \"2\", route to Bob's subaccount, etc.  For digit \"0\", route to the ring group of all co-workers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 10 (some days later) : When your old office number is finally ported to voip,ms** \\- Go through each of the 5 subaccounts, and change it to the correct phone number. When that is done, you can release the temporary DID. You wont have to change anything on your coworker's mobile phones, it all will adjust automatically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 11 : Set up VOIP app (Bria or GroundWire) on your & coworker mobile phones.** (I use Bria, many prefer GroundWire).  Give each co-worker their subaccount ID and password, along with the server used by the mobile app to sign-in (usually will be something like [montreal5.voip.ms](https://montreal5.voip.ms), [tampa3.voip.ms](https://tampa3.voip.ms), or whichever server you selected as the one closest to your geography).  Each co-worker will need to buy and setup their voip app on their mobile phone, but this is easy...\n\nDepending on the mobile voip app you choose and your smartphone type (ios or android), setup instructions can be found here: [https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Softphones](https://wiki.voip.ms/article/Softphones)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Step 12: If you want to get a bit more fancy...** If people are working at their computers most of the time, and they already have headphones because they are on Zoom or Teams all the time, it's possible to also make your people's laptops a softphone and answer on the computer. It's more comfortable to use a headset than a mobile. That way, when someone tries to reach jim, it will ring on all of Jim's devices -- mobile and laptop.

Smaller firms tend to keep this in house because it allows them to keep control. In bigger firms, this gets much harder because the staffing gets pretty tough.\n\nThe first question you need to answer is whether your current set up works. A paralegal doing the calls is expensive. He/she has other skills so they may be able to do other things that make more money.  You could then hire a dedicated intake person to handle the calls. The cost differential would be small because your paralegal (theoretically) could be making you more money. But here\u2019s the rub: you have to hire a great intake person. If the intake person sucks air, it will kill your firm. That\u2019s why lots of firms outsource this. The intake person is a mix of legal knowledge, compassion and sales.  Good ones are invaluable. Bad ones are fatal to the firm. \n\nIn my mind, the best next step would be to document your process with your current paralegal. Figure out what they do. How many calls a day?  How much time does it take per call?  What is the sign up rate (of the cases you want)?  No one is 100%. What are the cases you want? Don\u2019t want?  You need a very very very detailed process so you can then go to market and find someone to do it.  That person could be an in house hire or from a service. Either way, you need to know the process in exquisite detail and be able to track the results. You can\u2019t measure success any other way. \n\nOnce you implement the new hire, you need milestones and metrics to measure success. This is a royal pain in the a$$ because it feels like babysitting. But you have to do it to be sure you\u2019re not getting screwed by the new hire. If you don\u2019t, you will be in 6 months and realize you have no cases coming in because your new person didn\u2019t know he/she was doing it wrong (or was just bad at the job). \n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u2019ve done this.

Don't let anyone lie to you about their expectations. \n\n2) My SAs are amazing in their \"support\" of me, so I \"support\" them back with equal passion and zeal. So *together* we've managed to hit some impossible deadlines and sometimes triumph on behalf of our clients. They are as respectful of my abilities and limits as I am of theirs. I wouldn't work for someone (attorney or not) who didn't respect their need to support me. That is the \"price\" of loyalty. \n\n3) I have been handed a task and told \"go.\" BUT, along with that, the guidance to figure the shit out, and the acknowledgment that my first draft wouldn't be perfect. The best part of my training is when my SAs answer my questions with \"here is where you can look this up\" instead of annoyance. It makes me smarter and more capable, and also reflects that THAT is what they want.\n\n4) To quote:\n\n> \"I've only been litigating a year and have no idea what I'm doing. It's a whole new area of law for me.\"\n\nAs a newb to the legal field, the biggest shock for me was learning that my SAs (both of whom I consider to be among the smartest, most ethical, and kindest humans I have had the privilege to know)... don't think they know shit. \n\nThey are ALWAYS looking things up, NEVER assuming they \"know what they are doing.\" Both are litigators. Litigation is, by definition, NEVER the same thing twice in a row. My opinion on this matter is worth fuck-all, but you asked the question, so my answer is: if you don't love it being new where you don't know what you're doing, *but can do it with the right support and time and love*, don't litigate. But that is YOUR choice. I f'ing love the fact that my last career will be filled with learning new skills until I'm too mentally weak to learn more. Then I'll die happily. But, that's me. Your mileage may vary.\n\n5) To quote, again:\n\n> (cue panic attack today crying in my office)\n\nI \"retired\" from being a professional chef to focus on being a paralegal. There's a well-known phrase in the restaurant industry about \"crying in the walk-in\" which means going into a big-ass refrigerator and closing the door before you let loose on those excess emotions. The reason it's a trope is that... well... e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e has done it, and instead of thinking overwhelming emotions are \"toxic\", the food service community accepts it is part of life.\n\nIt's 10X that in the legal community, but somehow some/most of y'all don't simply accept that. What you do as lawyers is passionate, HARD, taxing, challenging work. And YOU have to accept the responsibility for success or failures. We paras? Legal assistants? Admins? We have ZERO authority. We support you. YOU have to bear the brunt of being right or wrong, ethical or not, winning or losing. \n\nI've cried more in the past year than I did in the past decade before I became a paralegal. But not once has it been \"woe is me\" tears, it's just... I'm the one who has to read through medical records and summarize a traumatic crash that left a successful woman unable to perform her job, and an insurance company fights to profit at her expense. I'm the one who has to transcribe 441 voicemails from a psycho stalking an ex, highlighting the most ugly possible ones, so that we can make sure the ex gets a restraining order. \n\nBut **I**, I, am your SUPPORT. YOU have to do the hard work.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't trust an attorney who didn't cry, because what y'all do is EVERY day hard if you do it right, and sometimes you lose even when you are righteous. So all I have to say to you is if you feel alone when you cry in your office, your \"boss/es\" should understand you rather than making you feel alone. Mine do. Empathy is a superpower, and even at my advanced age, I would NEVER work for a human who didn't embrace mine.\n\n6) If you ask your superiors for guidance and they don't give it to you, they are not worthy of your efforts. I don't know whether two days is enough, I'm too new to law. But... at my \"peak\" in terms of people I managed, I had roughly 200 people whose jobs depended on my leadership, and roughly $500 million in \"revenue\" for my company resting on my shoulders. I couldn't imagine ignoring an \"ask\" for guidance. And if you, as you put it, \"plea for help,\" any worthy \"boss\" would respond. So ask yourself this: are they WORTHY of your efforts?\n\nAnd last...\n\nA couple years ago, I accepted what seemed like a \"dream job\" as a chef. Great boss, great opportunity. Well, the day after I accepted the offer, the great boss quit, and I was suddenly starting a job with THREE empty positions above me. I was salaried. My first week, I worked 82 hours, all due to problems outside my control. I did the math, and realized that instead of being a chef at a pretty hot/sexy hotel in my town, I would have made more money (this is not an exaggeration) working minimum wage where I live. \n\nI *PROUDLY* put the job on my resume, and when I was asked why so short a time, I was honest, gave my reasons for leaving, wished that I could have stayed there. \n\nDon't diminish your pride in your value because it wasn't appreciated. Be honest about your reasons for staying or leaving.\n\nI love the last phrase of the post I am commenting on:\n\n\"You are a lawyer-stick up for yourself.\"\n\nMany humans don't have that first part, so please... take advantage of your education, your hard work, and your privilege. \n\nStick up for yourself. No one else will unless they love you, and one can never assume that. \n\nY'all chose a really fucking hard job, being attorneys.

Because honestly, the answer is that there's a lot of reasons that can be individual to that lawyer. \n\n1.  Many states require or encourage lawyers to take pro-bono cases as a public service by the bar to the public and require some reporting of that as a part of annual licensing.  The American Bar association encourages this.  Some lawyers do generally view it as a community service.    https://www.americanbar.org/groups/probono_public_service/policy/arguments/ \n\n\n2.  Depending on the context, lawyers may have particular cases or causes that they care about and choose to take pro-bono. It may be friends and family, political affiliation, or genuine community service.   Doing pro-bono work is also a good networking activity in some context. \n\n3.  At the end of the day \"out of pocket\" expenses for any particular case for most lawyers are small, it's just time and effort. Don't get me wrong, if you charge for your time as your profession, your time is valuable.  But a lawyer taking on a pro-bono case with a small time commitment is not the same as  say, requiring a contractor to build a free house (which requires a substantial financial commitment). \n\n4.  Lawyers, in some cases, particularly in the criminal or family law context, will get stuck by ethics rules on cases where they haven't been paid but cannot withdraw due to prejudice to their clients.  This varies state by state. \n\nI don't do a lot of \"true\" pro-bono cases, but I do a lot of community service work. I'm on the board of my local law library, I'm on the board of the local food pantry. For several years I coached the local town high school's mock trial team as a volunteer.

I use smith.ai to answer my main line, and I only pay $10 a month for them.  They screen sales calls out for free.  Legitimate calls I pay them $10 a call for, with a minimum of $10 a month.  My volume fluctuates significantly, so this deal works out so well for me.\n\nI was once very skeptical of a virtual reception service when I thought they were killing expensive leads for a client.  I put together a quality control where the line forwarded to a cloud service that recorded every call and used ai to both transcribe the call to an email notification and ran sentiment analysis on it, notifying if it detected a call going sideways.  The service forwarded right through to the virtual reception line, so it was like in the middle.  Of course, the act of recording and ai analysis was announced on the line for privacy and eavesdropping concerns, and it was disabled for callers from Illinois because of BIPA.  \n\nI only ran this for like 3 or 4 months before I was satisfied with the service, then I cut it out to reduce cost.  Always an option if you think your VR might suck.  There are a lot of them out there that sell themselves as legal only, or even run by and mostly staffed by recovering attorneys.  Others, like smith.ai, that offer options to use your scheduler, collect payments or run conflicts checks for you.

Calculate Cost of Sales (Labor)**\nCalculate how much it costs, in labor, to service your clients. Including your time, contractors, etc.\n\nThe idea here is to ask and answer: \"How many hours total does it cost to service clients?\"\n\nLet's say it takes an average of 10h per client across all roles. Break down how much time is spent per role to calculate capacity per role. You'll use this downstream to know when to hire to meet your demand.\n\n\n**Step 2. Calculate Cost of Sales (Software)\nCalculate how much you spend on software to service your clients. Clio Manage, law libraries, document prep software, Word, cloud storage, etc.\n\nThese are only software related to actually services the client. Not just to run your business (those are operating expenses).\n\n**Step 3. Calculate Other Cost of Sales**\nFiling fees, document prep fees, copy making, paper, ink, etc. Again, things directly associated with actually servicing a client.\n\n---\nAdd all of that up for the same period you calculated CAC for and you have your **Cost of Sales**.\n\nNow, calculate your Gross Profit for that same period by subtracting all Cost of Sales from Gross Revenues.\n\nGross Profit = Gross Revenue \u2013 Cost of Sales\n\n*Gross Revenue is really Lifetime Gross Revenue; the total amount of money you make from all customers over time before subtracting costs.*\n\nAnd *Gross Profit* is really Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP); the total amount of gross profit you make from all customers over time.\n\nTake LTGP and divide it by the # of clients and you get your average LTGP per customer.\n\nNow you can calculate your LTGP:CAC ratio.\n\n---\n## Improving the Ratio\nImproving the ratio comes down to two things:\n\n1. Reduce your costs\n2. Increase revenue\n\nFor most businesses at your stage, you should focus on increasing revenue before reducing costs. A lot of folks get this backwards in the early years, run out of steam, and go bankrupt.\n\n### Increase Revenue\nThere's only two ways to increase revenue:\n\n1. Get more people to buy from you.\n2. Get people to pay more.\n\nAnd yes, people buy from you. Your service is your product.\n\n## Get More to Buy\nTell more people about your stuff\u2014that's **advertising**; it doesn't have to be paid media either.\n\n**Increase availability** \nThis is the single biggest point of leverage I see firms lose out on.\n\nTake more calls. Follow up more and faster. People don\u2019t just want to hire a lawyer from 9\u20135 (that's when they're working).\n\nIf someone calls you after hours and you don\u2019t answer, they'll call someone else. Whoever answers first is probably gonna get the deal.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this...and you don't have to make more money either.\n\nMake it as easy as possible. \n\nCan potential clients text you to inquire about your services?

I am not a fan of ads really, the best cases are from other lawyers or word of mouth. I tried them and mostly they were more expensive than they were worth.

Work really hard at getting positive Google reviews. You simply ask clients who you believe or satisfied if they\u2019re willing to give you five stars and to write a word or two.\nIf you do good job, you should be able to get reviews, but don\u2019t be discouraged if only one or two out of five or 10 people you help actually give reviews.\n\n2. don\u2019t overlook YouTube videos. You can talk about common subjects or questions that your clients ask ask you without giving specifically legal answers. Of course you should always have a disclaimer that it is not legal advice. You\u2019re giving just examples of certain situations and that every situation can be different.\n\n3. I\u2019m a big fan of \u201cdo it yourself\u201c websites and content let\u2019s face it you are the product that people are considering purchasing. For that reason, I think it\u2019s best that the content you post to be your very own. This takes time but when I have downtime, I use it for this and for the videos, which means I seldom have downtime as I use any spare time for marketing.\n\n4. There are several platforms that basically offer some version of a \u201cdo it yourself kit for making a website. There are ones like Wix that are not specific to law firms. I am very fond of and us Lawlytics as they are budget, friendly and geared towards lawyers.\n\nMany other web providers exist, but they usually charge quite a bit of money.\n\nI also think you should avoid the various Legal directories. Door paying them to list your name in their directory and usually you don\u2019t get a very good return on investment. I\u2019m sure there are some lawyers who\u2019ve had success with companies like AAVO or Legal Match but in my experience, they\u2019ve never been worth the price.\n\nTry not to make the mistake that I did several years ago and using somebody who promised the moon but had a flat fee monthly for their Webb service. It cost me something like 60 grand and almost put me in bankruptcy. fortunately, I learned from the mistake and was able to recover and have implemented the things I\u2019ve discussed above. That said I would really avoid anything that requires a long-term expensive contract. I also would take with a heavy grain of salt.

Also if they mess up they will credit the call and call the PC back if you ask. One area where it tends to make mistakes is understanding the geography of my state, which makes sense given that the receptionists are from all over the country. Probably the hardest part of instructions is getting them to understand which counties I accept for some services but not others (e.g. mediation/appeals vs. trial-level work). I don't use their chat service bc it is more expensive than call answering but I imagine it might be helpful for some types of traffic.

Almost all of their plans provide a will/power of attorney document for each member on a plan at no additional cost. so for your $30-$50 bucks you get an attorney discussing and preparing your basic estate plan for you. That alone makes it a good value.\n\nAttorneys generally charge by the hour. So if you have legal concerns that really need an answer, paying $50 for a month's worth of attorneys time is (again) a good value.\n\nIt won't fix everything, and won't do everything for you, though.\n\nI think the biggest issue Legalshield/Pre-Paid legal has always dealt with but never really bothered to address is the disconnect in their business model. Being a tiered sales company using outside sales people, they've always had people over-promising the product. There's no incentive or no real check on it since the law firms cannot be directly involved in marketing (ethics) and LS doesn't control the associates directly and harshly enough to control the expectation issue. LegalShield prioritizes catering to their sales associates over their product/the firms, so any concerns about salesmanship are largely ignored. \n\nIf LegalShield ever bothered to actually put the product and the firms first (which would require the sales structure be de-prioritized and forcing it into second position), i think the reputation and value would skyrocket. \n\nRight now, all of Legalshield's marketing, training, and corporate develop prioritizes getting more sales people into the tiers and securing more associate managers to increase profit potential. That comes at the expense of expectations and market share when the sales model hasn't changed for decades and they refuse to develop an updated strategy to clear the current plateau.

Rather, think of it as a dozen buckets you set out to catch slow drips of clients. It might feel disappointing to put out a new \"facebook page\" bucket and not see immediate returns, but when you have dozens of trickles of phone calls it really adds up. \n\n**Here's what has worked for my EP clients:**\n\n1. Solid SEO on your website. Make sure it's well set-up. However I doubt ongoing SEO will be valuable unless you happen to live in a city where few other EP firms are making an effort. Instead consider the following: \n\n1a) Write blog posts that answer common EP questions. Most people search in the form of questions. If you have a blog post that is phrased the same as their question, along with the answer, then you'll likely get a call here and there.\n\n1b) Write blog posts that answer uncommon questions. A single blog post that answers a question no other law firm has answered will reliably generate calls for years. \n\n2. Facebook page - have a facebook page and a way to keep it updated every week or so. The \"freshness\" shows you are active and hard working. The page itself isn't going to attract new clients, but it is one of the things people check on when researching you. \n\n3. YELP - Don't bother advertising with yelp, but do have a business listing and work hard to get a few 5-star reviews from your clients.  Again, this won't attract new clients but lots of people research there, so you want to have a good rating. \n\n4. Google business listing - Probably your most important listing. Call friends, family, and anybody who might give you a good review and get a few on there. One very important aspect of this tool is to ask people to specifically mention \"estate planning lawyer\" or some other variation of what you do. Google treats this like gospel and if everybody in your reviews is saying you're great with estate plans, it is way more likely to show you to people looking online. \n\n5. Youtube - Again, it's unlikely a video of yours will result in calls (but it can happen), but I am always surprised at the number of clients who say \"I was researching you and saw your video about....\" You don't have to go crazy, just have a channel and a handful of videos that let you introduce yourself and the firm by perhaps answering a few questions, or describing the EP process for new clients. \n\nAll of that is possible to do for free yourself. Here's the paid stuff:\n\n6. Do a few online searches and see who and what already ranks for your key phrases. For example, if stupid AVVO ranks #1 for \"estate plan lawyer\" then consider trying out a listing on AVVO for a while and see if it generates calls.  If they don't appear, then don't waste your money. Some jurisdictions will have random sites like \"thumbtack,' or \"ELocal\" or some other small-time directory show up #1. If they rank well in your area, try them out.  \n\n7. Paid lead services - paid lead services can work, but are usually overpriced and often do not work. The way to weed out the duds is easy: insist that they let you do month-to-month, with a generous method for disputing bad leads, and no shared leads. Lead services vary in quality from location to location, so there's no one company that works everywhere. I have had clients who see great success with one lead company, only to find it's a complete waste one state over. \n\n8. Google leads - Google wants everybody on their leads service. It shows prominently above everything else in search results. However it is by far the most expensive advertising you can do with Google. It's worth checking out to see how the price and results are in your area, but I find for most small firms it's simply a budget eater. \n\n9. Google Ads / Adwords - Google ads can generate a fairly steady stream of ads for you, if set up well. Save yourself money by very carefully setting up spend budget, location, keywords, and negative keywords. I've seen way way too many firms blow cash out the window with poorly configured ad campaigns. Avoid using Google's adwords consultants, who seem focused on getting you to spend the most possible and who simply don't understand things like jurisdictions and attorney advertising rules. A good Google Ads campaign doesn't need to cost a ton. Even a few hundred per month can bring in cases. \n\n10. Facebook advertising - Google Ads is focused on people who already know what they want - Estate Planning. Facebook is focused on more traditional advertising by showing ads to people who may not be actively searching for estate planning, and hopefully creating the desire to get it done. Facebook lets you target demographics of all sorts, like people of a certain age, income, etc. So they are very powerful. However, you'll want to be updating your ads regularly and make sure you keep your facebook page updated as well. \n\n11. Direct mail - haven't had a lot of success with this as far as ROI goes, but I know some firms will simply send out a  \"congratulations\" letter to all new home buyers, inviting them to come in and make a trust, perhaps with a discounted rate if they bring in their letter. In my experience this will bring in enough clients to cover the cost of the campaign, but not the return you'd hope for. That's up to you if you feel like it's worth it to generate a larger pool of people who call you their lawyer or not. \n\n**General stuff:**\n\nI have never heard of a 9x ROI being a minimum. I personally go with 5x, since most attorneys where I operate hover around a 20% fee split if they refer a client. I figure the advertising has to be at least as good as or better than the cost of splitting fees. However most of my clients do highly competitive PI, so we see much higher ROI on campaigns for things like criminal defense, probate, family law, etc. \n\n* Avoid people who try to sell you on \"packages.\" You don't need an SEO \"package\" or extraneous services bundled in with whatever service you are after. \n* The places I would hire help rather than DIY would be: \n   * setting up Google Ads (just not help from Google representatives themselves!) unless you're experienced there already. \n   * creating graphics for your facebook or other ads. Design is hard. You don't want to look like an amateur\n   * videography & editing for your 4 or 5 youtube videos\n   * Photos of yourself, your team, and office for use on website, ads, etc.\n   * Creating the landing pages on your site for your Google Ads / other ads. \n* Optional spending if you don't have the time to DIY:\n   * Writing those blog posts each week.\n   * Updating Facebook\n\n**Here's the order of priorities:**\n\n1. Website looking good, with professional photos and design, and landing pages for each service you offer ready to capture leads from your ad campaigns. \n\n2. Online directories like Google maps, yelp, bing, AVVO, Jusita, etc. set up and each with a dozen 5-star reviews. Ask friends and family to help with the initial batch of reviews. Get them to mention \"estate planning lawyers.\" \n\n3. Google ads running, trying to capture people who already have their shopping shoes on. Do search ads only, not display ads or leads for now. You want people already low in the sales funnel.\n\nOnce those are up and running, everything else can be added in as your budget and bandwidth allow.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1718383100, "created_utc": 1718383100, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l8lpbx0", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1df772c", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l8lpbx0", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1df772c", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1df772c/social_media_vs_google_vs_bing_roi_estates/l8lpbx0/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1718383116, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service expensive", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_not_ready", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-06-14"}

Does a website need to be \"SEO-friendly\"?\n2. Does an \"SEO-friendly\" website lead to an SEO contract proposal?\n3. How much to spend monthly for SEO to be worked?\n4. How much is the monthly cost of a website to run (not including SEO service)?\n\nI will give you simple answers to your questions.\n\n**(1) Yes, you are correct.**\n\nYour website should be user-friendly. But it has nothing to do with an SEO contract. Mostly, modern-design website template has included 'SEO-friendly' as the minimum feature.\n\nSo, what makes a website \"SEO-friendly\"?\n\n1. It has a good structure on the page, such as a page should have a minimum of one (1) HTML tag of H1 and has another H2 and H3 for subtitles.\n2. The website should have breadcrumbs.\n3. The website should have an XML sitemap to register on GSC.\n4. Website load speed should be under 3 seconds.\n5. That's all for now.. :)\n\n**(2) No, it isn't.**\n\nSEO service is a separate task from building a website. But, if you hire an SEO service, one of their jobs is to make your website \"SEO-friendly\" (if it isn't already).\n\n**(3) Normally, you will see the result within 3 - 6 months.**\n\nBut here is the caveat. When you see your website rank is good on SERP, doesn't mean all the work is done. You still need to maintain the page. That's why some SEO agencies or freelancers offer monthly contracts. If you don't maintain the page, it could sink into the search engine results.\n\n**(4) There are many parameters to put into consideration to answer this one.**\n\nWhere is the website hosted? Do you have a paid third-party plugin (if using WordPress)? Do you have another service integrated into the website? But for normal use, building a website could cost you around $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the complexity. This is just for development, not including the cost of hosting and domain. Some big agencies could charge you way more expensive.\n\n**Simplest solution..?**\n\nUsing WaaS (Website as a Service). This is a rare term used in the internet.

I vowed to myself that when I got back on my feet I would never be dependent on an employer again.\n\nMoved to a low COLA city, travelled to some highly compensated foreign language doc reviews to start saving up for rental properties. Also worked for a CPA who worked for HNW families and celebrities so I learned how to do bookkeeping. Gradually got a few properties going which now mean I wake up on the first of the month with the mortgages paid and about $3k to put toward my day by day operating expenses. I.e. they net about $36k/year after debt service and property taxes (yes, I made substantial improvements in each to get them from how I bought them to justifying those rents.)\n\nWhile scouting for properties I got cold called by a realtor and switched to him. I figured out how to close my own houses and he asked me if I wanted him to refer me clients. I said sure and promptly approached a local lawyer who did real estate and asked him if I brought the clients and gave him 50% of my fees would he cover my malpractice insurance and teach me how to do it. He said sure.\n\nAfter about 6 months to a year I could do 99% of a deal front to back with my eyes closed and adjusted my split to 90/10. Within two years that realtor, who had cold called me as his very first cold call, became the #1 producing agent in a top 3 brokerage in our region. One of his clients left sales to become a realtor and is now #10. Other realtors saw that I was a lone wolf, completely independent from the political BS and the kickbacks that abound here, and started throwing me deals.\n\nAfter three years I approached the title company I work with (who I picked because they are the best and the fastest and not because one of the local real estate brokerages is telling me I need to pay them $800 a month  and use their preferred title company to get referrals) and asked them to teach me how to be examining counsel. They did and now I get EC fees on my purchaser deals, and am additionally able to deliver my deals that much faster than other attorneys who use the bigger and slower title companies and don't write their title commitments themselves.\n\nThe bookkeeping was my main gig before the real estate took off and I still keep a small group of pet bookkeeping clients (one of them pays 100% of my health insurance so that's taken care of, and the rest nets about $1k a month on top). Being a business management consultant yourself and having a professional level understanding of bookkeeping comes in REAL HANDY when your solo side gig starts taking off and you need to start doing your own escrow accounting for a real estate heavy practice.\n\nIf you are organized, do not procrastinate, and can keep track of several moving parts, real estate has an excellent dollar to effort ratio. I work out of my house and pay 10% of my gross to a firm to provide me with an office I barely go to, my malpractice insurance, and access to a conference room and a professional copier/scanner. The real estate work is netting about $75-85k and still trending upward at this point for about 2-3 hours of desk work a day, which I usually do in the late afternoon/early evening. Otherwise I bring my phone wherever I go and answer emails and calls from the gym, a hike, dog training class (the kids are 15 now and I still have them, and none of us ever has to worry about how many dogs a landlord will allow ever again), etc.\n\nThis year I've started travelling about one week out of every month to anywhere that has an internet connection so I've been to Ireland, Portugal, just got back from Austin, will be seeing The National play in Detroit, MSG, Toronto, Berlin and Munich this year, have plane tickets to visit family in Denver, also doing some Midwest art trip my mother wants to go on in the fall, etc. It's all possible when you have your own book of business and can make your own rules.\n\nI absolutely love my clients, the realtors I work with, and the lifestyle I am able to enjoy. I could not be happier with how everything fell into place.\n\nOh and two years ago I turned down ~$125k to work for a large local firm. My days of commuting in to work every morning and having to ask if I can take a trip somewhere I feel like going are behind me.\n\nBasically?\nFigure out the business management side of things first and then make friends with other professionals. Refer work to get work. Instead of pretending to know everything, tell people you don't know stuff and ask them to teach you. Always be honest and represent your clients. Banks and brokers I have held to the fire til they did right by my clients throw me work now because in the end they respect a competent attorney who always answers the phone.\n\nHuge mistakes I see other attorneys making is focusing on appearances \"oh we need a fancy office\" and hiring for all of their organizational/admin work rather than learning how to do it efficiently themselves. Honestly folks, let get of those \"I didn't go to law school to organize my own calendar\" hang ups. Learn how to do the bookkeeping, how to use a Google tracking sheet, stop procrastinating, keep track of your own deadlines and get your work done ahead of time. If I have personally driven out to a client's property to singlehandedly drag a futon out of the second floor and get it listed on Buy Nothing ($2k credit to the buyer MY ASS), you can use a calendar by yourself. The number of other attorneys I see who waste their time being disorganized and spending 70% of their gross on largely useless administrative support and other overhead is insane. They're working 40+++ a week keeping the cash flow going to maintain it all and I'm sending their paralegal a quick email from a riverboat in Europe and taking more home in the end.

You've spent a fortune getting this person, don't drop the ball when they do. Phone must be answered appropriately. Phone number and email addresses accurate. No dead links.\n\n Google still weighs location above many other things. So make sure your domain name addresses however it is people find you. If they mostly find you by name and your group pops up easily, then you are fine.  If people can't find you without already knowing your site, you might consider updating your domain to something that addresses location and potentially  your practice area because that way your practice area and location are everywhere on your site aitomatically. You can still keep your practice name domain as a landing page. But your main site needs a name that fully supports your SEO.\n\nTHIS IS THE SINGLE MOST COMMON MISTAKE I SEE. A BAD DOMAIN.  Although it's nowhere near as common as it used to be.\n\nThese are things that are often not a one time job, but need to be monitored. \n\n\n*Spend some time on keywords.*\n  The biggest success I ever had was using the form names used in an obscure branch of government law for ads and SEO because the only people that used that term were people who potential clients for this firm.  \n\nGet real familiar with your firm's practice areas and how people find your practice areas. Note, this is different  if you are a name brand firm in your area this may be less important, but not much.  Basic content marketing and basic seo (tags and file labels and image labels and blogs and H1/H2  headings reflecting your search needs)  are basically free and shoukd be done as a matter if course. This takes discipline mainly. \n\n*Focus more on relationship marketing.*\n\nReal talk, most big deals are done on the golf course, not the internet.\n\nEven if you are a small firm that needs awareness to even get started,  building relationships with people that cab feed you business should be your main focus. CPAs and other professionals that work with business owners mainly.  Or if you get work from other firms, work on those relationships.  People hire people they know and trust.  Look at who those people are in your life. If your principles/partners are utterly incapable, you need to hire someone who can fill this role.\n\nOther stuff that works:\n\nLunch and learns, as well as teaching classes can give you a reason to contact potential trial clients and keep you top of mind plus can provide evergreen content to support seo if recorded.\n\nPR in terms of news stories, partners awards, charity events where your firms name is prominent.\n\nBillboards- highly dependent  on area in terms roi..\n\nA pretty website is worthless if no one sees it. \n\n*No one hires a lawyer based on a pretty website.*\n\n Easy to find the info visators need and supporting people finding you is its purpose.\n\nPs- the worst results I ever had -in any industry- was an attorney who had a common name and insisted on using his practice name as his domain.  It was a vanity thing.  He didn't have the money to overcome this handicap with ad or content marketing. Which would have been hugely expensive in his market.  I tried everything in my arsenal to get him to understand what would work better.  To this day, you have to put his exact website in the search bar to find it. It's horrible. That being said,  almost all of his work comes from other firms that know him personally.  It's still annoying to try to find his address and phone number because it's so far down the search results.\n\nEdit to add:  my measure of success is how much good quality work my firm gets.

Still generally true, so posting it below. But a couple of minor updates:\n\n- feel like the customer support is regressing - maybe related to them signing up too many customers without equivalently growing their customer support team.\n- they keep talking about having some kind of secret sauce behind how they choose the right llm in responding to queries, but it has been difficult getting substantial details about that. Hopefully in the near future. Related to the above point. \n\n-----\n\nI agree with some of this, and disagree with some of this. I use Harvey regularly, and have done so for the last 12-ish months. I'm at a non-US firm with about 5000 people worldwide. \n\nAGREE\n- Harvey is a wrapper. They seem to have given up on substantially \"tuning\" the models that they use. They just announced that they are making available Claude and Gemini (in addition to GPT) - Expanding Harvey's Model Offerings\n\nI don't necessarily see this as a negative. My general view of LLMs is that they will become commoditised, and the value will be in the layer(s) that sit on top of the LLM - there are so many good LLMs now. \n\n- Harvey is expensive. We got a substantial discount in the first couple of years for getting an enterprise licence. But it'll become very expensive (I don't have the exact figure, but USD1000/seat/month sounds about right for a rack rate). So if I was running my own firm or part of a small firm, I wouldn't look at Harvey for that reason alone - there's too much competition out there, whether from foundation models or from wrapper companies. \n\n- A lot of Harvey is hype. They clearly have a very solid, dedicated marketing / PR team. They do interviews with the right crowd, their blogs are very polished, and their founder's public messaging always stay on point. I mean... it's Silicon Valley. \n\n- I have generally been unimpressed thus far with the workflows. They have just introduced a \"customs workflows\" feature for building my own workflows, and a \"playbooks\" feature for building playbooks based on existing documents. Both of these have have some promise, but I need to test them more to have a strong view either way. \n\nDISAGREE\n- I have found Harvey useful - so I disagree with OP's general negativity about the product.\n\nIt is definitely not perfect. But a couple of comments there:\n\n(1) It has improved massively since I first tried it in 2023. My view (that I told my firm about) at the time was that Harvey was crap, and we shouldn't get it until it improved massively. I also think when they first started out, they tried too hard at tuning (see above). \n\n(2) There are three main positives about Harvey that I see now. \n1 - the wrapper is straightforward, simple and easy to use - this is a very big deal for busy lawyers who don't want to deal with crap interfaces. \n2- the output is generally good. At an individual level - document summarisation, BD article preparation, short advice writing, sense checking answers, bouncing ideas, proof reading, improving emails (including by uploading samples of work) - it's generally worked pretty well. E.g. I was asked to put together a short pitch the other day, answering 5 questions, where I knew I had the source materials from a few different documents - Harvey put it together for me at a solid level. Saved me a hour or so there. \n\nAt a team level - Vault has been a game change for data extraction from mass documents, e.g. we've had good results using Vault for DD in the property space.\n\nThe major qualification - you HAVE to put a lot of time in to write the prompts, clean the documents to be uploaded (so that they are good quality uploads), and verifying results. So there is no way that you can go from 100 to 0 in terms of time used. But even if you save 20-30% of time - that is a massive saving, both on an individual or team level - particularly on fixed price / capped fee projects.\n3 - very good customer support (see above). \n- I don't believe you need to be a senior ex-big law person to build a good Gen AI product for the legal industry - so I found all of the stuff that focused on that within the OP to be fluff. The people that I've dealt with, primarily on the support side, have been solid in their knowledge of both the law and the product. (See below.)\n\nOTHER COMMENTS\n\n- Harvey is geared to big law and big corporates. It is not geared to SMEs (see above). So it needs to be assessed in that light. E.g. they have dedicated account managers (the ones I've dealt with are all junior/mid level ex-big law), and their helpdesk responses have generally been quick and on point. They will work with us if we want to do things like hackathons or discuss use cases. They have also spent a lot of time working with firms on things like confidentiality / location of data / data segregation etc - getting a product through the IT / governance process of law firms is no joke. \n\n- Harvey has enough money now that they can build partnerships with orgs like LexisNexis. This is key - one of the main issues to date for many in my firm is that Harvey didn't have enough data sources (and their RAG feature has been slow to be introduced). Been able to bring LexisNexis proprietary info into the fold will be a game changer (for that reason also, I expect CoCounsel (or whoever TR backs) to be one of the long-term winners). \n\nOVERALL\n\nI've enjoyed using Harvey and continue to use it much more than CoPilot, but I also think it is facing a LOT of competition. \n\nInternally, we're open to the idea that after a few years, we may switch to something else (we are testing a couple others). But the feedback so far from our users have generally been positive about Harvey. Note that we do not allow users to use external (non approved) LLM.\n\nAs above - if I was running my own law firm or if I was in a SME firm - I would not use Harvey. Plenty of great LLMs / wrapper services out there that are much cheaper (or even build your own LLM), including those mentioned in this thread. I think it's an overpriced product aimed at law firms and big corporates - but in that context, it provides a solid service.\n\n-----", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1769833596, "created_utc": 1769833596, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "o2qingo", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1qrio2s", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_o2qingo", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1qrio2s", "permalink": "/r/legaltech/comments/1qrio2s/harvey_ai/o2qingo/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1769833614, "saved": false, "score": 18, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "legaltech", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ypxn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaltech", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 18, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service expensive", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_tried_rejected", "positive"], "_date": "2026-01-31"}

It's a total pain in the ass.\n\n - It's not MRR because they only want to buy when they need to refill their bucket of hours\n - You're still working by the hour\n - What about when they don't use all of their hours in one month? Now you're in a roll over situation, could roll over month to month and accumulate. \n- it\u2019s an accounting nightmare to track\n- the client never really trust you when you say you use X number of hours for a task\n\nIt's just a pain in the ass. I stopped doing that pretty quickly.\n\nThe way that I price recurring services is frankly unstructured.\n\nI look at it as a whole, and I usually chunk into things like teams. So as an example, when it comes to the web team, if I add up all of their MRR and then I add up all of their expenses in a month, am I making the profit margin that I want? That's kind of like take number one on pricing.\n\nNext, I confirm that the price that I'm paying is not too low for the marketplace and not too high that it\u2019s going to drive people away, even if I am hitting my profit margins. I really don't want to be making too much money frankly because then I'm just opening myself up for clients to leave for cheaper options in the future.\n\nThe final evaluation is the company as a whole, certainly in startup mode, you're not going to have the volume that you will in a couple of years, making it tough at first. I just need to make money every single month, which means I change my pricing as my volume and expenses change. \n\nI price in totality of the company to be quite honest with you - how is the whole company doing vs. individual services.\n\nI know it's not scientific. I've tried going down to, like, how much do we make per hour and profit per service and person. I've done all that analysis, and frankly, it just doesn't work. I keep it very simple. The natural tendency is to make it complex with tons of data analysis, and let the data decide. Or price way higher than you should and hope for the best in the end. But in the end, it just doesn't matter as long as I'm pricing it properly for the client, pricing it properly for the market, pricing it properly for me, and I make money every month in totality, not at the line item level.\n\nAll that said, I don't want to take a hit on any given line item. For example, if you are losing money on something like say a website because you then make money on something else as an add-on like SEO. It's very easy and natural for you to say to yourself, \"Well, websites are a loss leader \u2026 it\u2019s ok.\u201d That\u2019s a fool's folly. You should never knowingly lose money at any level.\n\nI know I didn\u2019t give you a direct answer. I don\u2019t think there is one. I also think that when people try to make it overly scientific, that\u2019s when they get into trouble. I\u2019m not saying, don\u2019t analyze\u2026 You should. But it really comes down to a gut call that someone, you, needs to make.\n\nI hope that gave you a lot to think about and it helps you. Best of luck launching your agency. Keep in mind, right now is the hardest part ever for you.

I\u2019m up to 15-20k per month. Started as niche on local service businesses. A nursery and a lawyer fell in my lap so I help them but my focus is local services in my dma. \n\nQuestion / problem I\u2019m seeking input on: \nCurrently, my largest client, a service provider of expensive outdoor projects. I have a great relationship with the owner, they very much appreciative of efforts. There is an older family member that handles the finances that has recently gotten involved in email threads, very impolite and a bit rude (this doesn\u2019t really matter, but I\u2019ve busted my ass for the results so I\u2019m a bit butt hurt full transparency) (they had very poor digital presence before I got involved). I \u201cfought\u201d for about a month have them agree to implement form posting direct to crm & utilizing call tracking software. This has been done since mid April 2025, until then they were relying on office staff to answer phones & receive email submissions and manually entering leads into crm. \n\nThey have been able to close about 400k in jobs since January - may from my efforts that were tracked in their crm (more accurate since April) total spend with fees is about 20k per month. Finance person is critiquing roi - fair enough. But the kicker is: \n\nThere is 5m in estimate sent / estimate viewed status since January from my sources.

I started my agency in parallel with 2 other guys who also started theirs in the same niche. And we met 2 more guys doing the same thing. Lead gen + appointment setting for Medspas.\n\nYes I would agree, I went a completely different route than they did right off the bat. They were much more confident in their service delivery (which back then, was based on nothing) and went almost straight away towards growing their client base. \n\nI do not say what I do not know. Which made it really difficult for me to sell my marketing services, even though I was the only one with professional sales experience. I was only comfortable asking to work for free with an extremely small commission on the backend. \n\nI knew nothing about the space: not what their services did, the effectiveness of the services compared to others, downtime, COGs, length of treatment, what tier of skilled labor was required, etc. \n\nI thought Botox was for lips.\n\nMy first client was cheap, that\u2019s why she took me on. But I got very lucky. She offered like every service the space has. Over 150 different services.\n\nI mapped every service on an excel sheet and had multiple, multi hour meetings with the owner every Sunday going over every treatment to answer all of the above questions.\n\nIn the meantime, I already sold a few moderately high-ticket, very profitable packages for her and she started to trust my judgement. Which allowed me to create an excel calculator with the treatments I found, from talking with her client base over the phone, people would want.\n\nWith essentially being allowed to do whatever I wanted, I would call her client list and based on my deduction from the discovery, I\u2019d make a custom package for them in real time and say, \u201cWell Sarah, you\u2019re not going to believe it, the promo we\u2019re running today is EXACTLY what you\u2019ve been looking for\u201d.\n\nThis really accelerated my knowledge of, not only the space, but also another business skill I wasn\u2019t aware I was building: creating offers people want to buy. And being able to gauge if this was a good or a bad package based on their reaction over the phone.\n\nMined you, I was losing money this whole time. Was a week away from homelessness. That triggered me to finally push for \u201cmonetization\u201d. It\u2019s really been up ever since. The rock bottom situation was last June.\n\nBut the reason why I\u2019m sharing this, is because you\u2019re right. I remember just a few weeks before I hit financial and emotional rock bottom, I was talking with one of the previously mentioned guys.\n\nHe was already collecting around $10k/m (rev), which at the time seemed like an insurmountable task. And it was all from service delivery! \n\nHe was telling me about his packages, and me obviously being familiar with the business numbers behind the treatments in those packages, told him that his clients aren\u2019t making any gross profit from his services. Yeah, the revenue numbers look great, but after you take into account COGs AND acquisition costs, the value is literally zero. \n\nHe at first did not know what I was talking about and once he understood, said the thought never even crossed his mind, nor did he care.\n\nI\u2019m saying this not to frame him as a bad guy, more as to say most people in this space, at least mine, are young guys looking to make a buck with no deeper understanding of business.\n\nAnd this deeper understand, and the drive to always try to go deeper, has allowed me to really build my own moat.\n\nThe experience selling over 50 original packages allowed me to eventually stumble across the single package we offer now. It is completely unique and there is absolutely nothing like it on the market. Zero. \n\nNo inspiration was taken from what I saw others were doing (in regard to packages). Just playing around with my intuition and excel sheet to see what stuck.\n\nYou are correct when you say that I do not panic. \n\nHyper fixating on one main problem for over a year has made us really incomparable in the market. We charge on average 10x more than our competitors and our clients who pay that would be writing a suicide note for leaving. \n\nThey sometimes try in parallel, testing another company out with a different Medspa service, and then complain how bad it is.\n\nThank you for having me reflect on that aspect of the journey. I have never given it much thought before this.\n\nMoral of the story: Delayed Gratification.\n\nKeep your personal expenses comically low boys!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1730458881, "created_utc": 1730458881, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "luu6xlm", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1ggxzst", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_luu6xlm", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_lutx3ua", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1ggxzst/wanted_to_share_a_win/luu6xlm/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1730458900, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service expensive", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-11-01"}

This is a grab bag of advice. \n\n1. Start putting x% of every dollar you earn into an owners equity account before expenses. If you plan for profit from the start you will actually build a business. \n\n2. Write out and automate all your operating procedures. If you do it twice start writing. If you do it three times it\u2019d better be perfect. \n\n3. Look at your SOPs you\u2019ve been building. What are you doing more often? Those are your best services to sell. \n\n4. Simplify your offering to one sentence your clients can repeat to another colleague at a networking event when they are complaining about their own business problems. This will be very concrete and specific. Senders.co is my favourite example. Went from a cold outreach agency to focusing only on email deliverability. Clients could then have this conversation, \u201chey my emails keep going to spam. How do you set up your email outreach?\u201d \u201cWell I got a friend who solves all my email deliverability. I\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d  You need to be someone\u2019s \u201cI got a friend\u2026\u201d answer. \n\n5. You need to focus on building pipeline enough that you can turn away at least 30% of clients in an up market. In a down market this will give you a buffer. \n\n5.1. Client acquisition comes from having a simple problem solution position as I mentioned\n5.2 Write out your expertise in detail\n5.3 Speak at events\n5.4 Invite your prospects to workshops to help them solve a small part of their problems. \n5.5 Find a larger partner who can downstream partners to you like a big software company or another large agency; use their marketing channel to push your thought leadership and workshops. \n5.6. Network network network. Find out where your clients are going and go there too. Use your clients to introduce you or give you a favorable review live during the networking event. \n5.7. Ask every client for a referral.\n\n6. Keep your old book of business engaged. Old clients are future clients. You should be recovering at least 10% of old clients. I\u2019d aim for 25%. \n\n7. Track time. Optimize. Automate. Cut. \n\n8. Learn how to find other problems your clients have and then offer to solve them. Don\u2019t just sell what team members you have on your bench. Learn to continuously find problems you can serve. \n\n9. Be resourceful on staffing. Meet other agencies you can subcontract to. Us Upwork or a specialist like InCommon. Fake it until you make it. Whatever. \n\n10. Keep your existing team training. Cycle in training time.\n\n11. Increase your rates.\n\n12. Business development is more important than fulfillment. You can always find someone to fulfil. You can\u2019t always find clients.\n\nThat\u2019s just a braindump from the Agency Cocktails club I ran.

Lots of folks find the vast scale of it draining, so kudos for lasting through that initial stress.\n\nThe key to a good \"productized email marketing service\" is going to be differentiating yourself from what's out there. Just a quick search on Reddit, Google, or TikTok is gonna bring up like 50 hustle bros that say they're already the best at what you're trying to sell.\n\nSaw you listed services in one of the other comments. Here's my thoughts:\n\n*  You said \"Email Campaigns: Up to 10 per month\"\n   * That's a good baseline package. I recommend if you're trying to sell different services, come up with a few tiers that people can choose from. If you're looking to sell 10, then offer, 5, 10, 25, and 100. Most folks aren't going to want to take the cheapest or the most expensive, and they'll typically take 10. If they take 5, try to upsell them after a few months. If they take 25 or 100, pop some champagne.\n* You said \"Subject Line Creation, Copy Editing, A/B Testing: Testing of subject lines and content\"\n   * All that's pretty standard/expected, and can mostly be done by ChatGPT at this point. I think it's best to just say they're included and move on. You're not going to differentiate yourself with any of these. \n* You Said \"Analytics: Advanced reporting with engagement analysis\"\n   * Make sure you have some examples ready for clients to review, since everyone says they have analytics.

Are there specific sectors you specialise in? \n\nDo your clients advocate for you/give testimonials? The most successful videographers I know have grown their businesses by recommendation/word of mouth, or because they got one or two big name companies (even if that\u2019s \u2018big\u2019 on a local level) that gave them credibility for new clients to trust them. This is helped even more if they\u2019ve got onto a preferred supplier list in bigger organisations. Marketing managers who go on to other companies will use them because they know and trust them. This can make it hard for other videographers to compete because it\u2019s a bit like finding a good hairdresser - once you find them you hold onto them! \n\nAs a long-time buyer of videography services, I definitely think the market\u2019s changed. Brands that get customers on Facebook, insta and TikTok etc can get away with phone and app edited videos, reels etc, especially if they\u2019re churning out a lot of them. That\u2019s not to say that all social media managers are any good at video or even design/graphics - but some are and it works for their audience. \n\nThat said, I know companies that pay for videographers to come and film and edit batches of content in one go that they can use for their socials over time.\n\nSome companies, particularly those with small budgets, may have a go at making longer videos that would normally be something they\u2019d hire a videographer for (with varying results!). If there\u2019s someone in house who says they can do it, the technology is readily available then they\u2019ll try and save a few quid.\n\nI used to take a more hands on role with videographers eg I\u2019d storyboard, script and do the interviews (I\u2019d be edited out, but would be the one getting the interviewee to say what I wanted them to). However I don\u2019t have time for all that now, so I use a company that, while more expensive, once briefed and I approve their approach, goes off and does everything. The final edit usually goes back and forth a few times, but they always do a good job. \n\nWe\u2019ve recently started doing more animated videos eg to convey company successes/facts and stats or explainer videos. The company we use for conventional videos, make animations too so I didn\u2019t have to look elsewhere, but I know not all do so that could be an area to get into if you\u2019re not offering that already.\n\nIf budgets are being squeezed then I can see some companies dropping or cutting back on videography, but there\u2019ll always be sectors/organisations that need them. \n\nOP: whether this is a temporary lull or a permanent shift, if you\u2019ve been going for six years, you\u2019ve got this!

Especially if they have capital (VC-backed or self-funded). The angle for idea-stage can be a quick, confidential and well-polished MVP, which can go a long way if they're planning to fundraise/pitch. Sure the barrier to making MVPs is lower with nocode tools etc, but this drives higher scrutiny, competition and standards, which is where your expertise shines.\n\nIf it's more of a bootstrapped startup, you can probably negotiate a small equity share in lieu of higher upfront compensation. Obviously this is riskier but if you believe in the product, team and vision, the reward can be greater.\n\nAside from startups, consider the many successful businesses with established cashflow and traction in their market. Advances in AI and computing present an opportunity for many of them to modernize their workflows. Changing market conditions are pressuring many to adapt (increase their capacity to serve excess demand) or answer surging expenses (increase efficiency by cutting costs to remain profitable). In either case this will push many to vertically integrate (where you come in to build their outsourced tools in-house, or to leverage their data and SOPs with AI and automation). \n\nIn many cases this looks like you assessing their tech stack and logically designing in-house product to replace these services and save them in the long run on subscriptions and retainers. Or if you go the AI/automation route, consulting to identify those assets and repetitive tasks to spin into systems saving them work hours (and potentially increasing conversion rates or unlocking new offers for a compounding effect).\n\nThis agency model (+ AI) is quite attractive to me and I'd love to connect and explore collaborating if anyone is open to expanding their current team or forming a new one.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1704553209, "created_utc": 1704553209, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kgl8f6w", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_18xhkgp", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kgl8f6w", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_18xhkgp", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/18xhkgp/any_experience_with_running_a_product_team_agency/kgl8f6w/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1704553225, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service expensive", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-01-06"}

I started my first agency when one of my clients asked me to get the entire sales funnel built for them, since they didn\u2019t have a team available at the time for them to take my copy and implement it in landing pages, automations and emails. They told me to find whatever talent I needed, tell them how much money I need, and get it done. So that\u2019s exactly what I did \ud83d\ude02\n\n2. For you, it should be LinkedIn. Startup founders are extremely active there because that\u2019s how they meet new team members, potential investors and even journalists when they need access to the press. \n\nBuild your authority by posting 3 kinds of content: (1) case studies and examples of your work, (2) thought leadership pieces proving you understand the startup ecosystem and the problems startups face (that you can solve), (3) educational how-to content that provides step-by-step processes to solve the problems you usually deal with, to demonstrate your expertise in your service.\n\nContinuously expand your network with both startup founders, CTOs and VCs (who can be like a factory of clients for you).\n\nEngage with their content, comment on their stuff, like it, share it if relevant.\n\nStart conversations with them focused on networking and building a relationship before selling. \n\nBuild a CRM (you can even do it in Notion) of everyone you engage with, take notes about them, and FOLLOW-UP!\n\nHop on virtual coffee chats.\n\nBook appointments where relevant.\n\nStructure win-win deals.\n\nAsk for introductions or referrals if relevant.\n\nThat\u2019s sort of what your funnel should be like.\n\n3. Tips on hiring: \n\n- Work with people on a per-project basis as independent contractors before they prove themselves. It can be a very costly mistake to hire the wrong person, they\u2019ll be hard AND expensive to get rid of. \n- Pay talent well and offer as many bonuses as you can. Creative talent is difficult to retain.\n- Make an enjoyable work environment, take care of your employees, make everyone feel like a family.\n- If someone wants to leave (to start their own thing or otherwise), let them go. If you don\u2019t and instead you propose higher salary, etc. it\u2019s a big mistake and their self-importance will grow excessively and create problems for you further down the road.\n- Assess personality-fit before hiring. Ideally you want to assess 3 things: skills, personality, and moral character in your hiring process. Skills are the least important, moral character the most.\n\nThat should give you enough food for thought for now.

The pros is THE DEMAND which is freaking massive, and also the PROFIT MARGINS, and the fact this is where the market is shifting. People are now buying products directly from social media apps like TikTok. I\u2019ll put things in perspective for you. When I was making $30K a month running my agency, my costs were only about $2,500 a month so I was brining in about $27,000K in profit BUT I\u2019ll tell you also more truth behind that later on\n\n2. Niches: I believing in Niching down but when you\u2019re first started out, you should work with several different niches because you need to find out #1 Who you can drive results best for and #2 Which niche you actually enjoy working best with and #3 Which niches do have the money to work with you. Example, you may be super good at working with online fitness coaches, but completely suck with finance companies. Even though finance companies may have more budget, if you can t provide results for them, you won\u2019t ever grow your business!! However DO keep industries who make money versus don\u2019t in mind. I love working with clients who have very healthy profit margins\n\n3. Edit videos yourself until you can\u2019t anymore. I used to edit myself up until I was making about $6K consistently. Then I learned how to outsource (which this in itself you\u2019ll have to learn how to do properly) \n\nSo this is the truth about SFC Agency.

The form does not specify how much the government is to pay. Instead, it is written that it is a $0 contract for professional IT services.\n\nThe government has been in turmoil since the beginning of the year after its contracts with the McKinsey firm made headlines again. The total amount reached $104.6 million for 24 contracts awarded since 2015. The three main opposition parties want to force the government to reveal the entirety of the documents.\n\nAccording to Professor Clarke, such contracts challenge a principle at the heart of the Statute of Westminster: that of a neutral, merit-based civil service that is able to serve the government regardless of the party in power.\n\nShe suggested that the government probably signed such a contract to move faster instead of having to put out a new tender each time. \"It's a complicated process,\" she concluded.\nThe MP for Beauport\u2013Limoilou tried to find out how much this 81-year contract would cost taxpayers. The senior policy advisor for the Treasury Board, Sean Boots, was cut off by the committee chair before he could answer and will have to send his response in writing.\n\nTransparency issue\n\nThe president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, a union representing 72,000 members, has sounded the alarm. \"The government has been relying on expensive outsourcing for years,\" said its president, Jennifer Carr. \"McKinsey is just the most recent example.\"\n\nShe said such outsourcing jeopardizes the security of government computer systems, is less transparent and undermines accountability.\n\nConservatives have pointed to the consulting firm's ties to the opioid crisis. The firm has also been ordered to pay nearly $600 million to 47 U.S. states for helping pharmaceutical companies boost sales of the psychotropic drugs.\n\nIn addition to the issues of costs, contract awarding and transparency, the use of McKinsey raises the issue of increasing immigration thresholds.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois is concerned about the links between the Century Initiative pressure group, which advocates public policies to increase the Canadian population to 100 million people by 2100, and the consulting firm.\n\nIts co-founder is Dominic Barton, who was the CEO of McKinsey until 2018. A year later, he was appointed Canada's ambassador to China, a position he held until 2021. He is due to testify before a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.\n\nMcKinsey says its \"work with the Canadian government is entirely non-partisan\" and \"focuses on fundamental management issues, such as digitization and improving operations.\"\n\n\"Despite what we have read or heard recently in the media, our office does not make any recommendations on immigration policies or on any other subject,\" she said on January 10.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1735135835, "created_utc": 1735135835, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m3qhxkb", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1hm186u", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m3qhxkb", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1hm186u", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1hm186u/world_record_80_years_federal_government_contract/m3qhxkb/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1735135850, "saved": false, "score": 65, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 65, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service expensive", "_search_bucket": "churn_billing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-12-25"}

Calendar sync needs to be real-time or you'll create more problems than you solve (learned this the hard way).\n\n4. For industries - I'd add elder care to your list.

As long as they're still reasonable and within ethics boundaries.\n\nIncrease rates as you can justify it and do so regularly.\n\n### Sell More Times\nCan you sell more things to people? Simple divorce, sure. Now what about name changes, new power of attorney documents, etc.\n\nBank future goodwill from referral partners by referring them to an estate lawyer, financial planning referral, etc.\n\n---\n## Reducing Costs\nThere are two main ways to reduce costs:\n\n1. Get clients for less (i.e., reduce CAC)\n2. Get results for less (i.e., reduce COS)\n\n### Reducing CAC\nThe best way to reduce CAC for most firms (especially solo lawyers) is to get better at sales (reducing Sales CAC). As I mentioned before, being more available, taking more calls, doing it faster, and following up more are the keys here.\n\nYou spend all this money on getting leads, don\u2019t let them go to waste by not doing everything you can to close them.\n\nKeep increasing this until you:\n\n- Have 16h of coverage minimum. You can always scale it back if you need. But it's not hard when texting is an option.\n- Follow up with leads within 5 minutes of them first contacting you. It doesn't have to be you. You can hire and train anyone to do this. Again, it's not hard when you have a single number people can text and anyone can respond to.\n\n**Tip:** Develop a script for closing. You can't give legal advice until they hire you. Someone else can qualify them before you close them. If you need help with this, DM me.\n\n**Reducing Marketing CAC**\nThere's a ton of ways to do this. It's more of a diagnosis process of figuring out where waste/opportunity exists.\n\nHere's how I think about it in terms of ad spend:\n\n- How much did I spend on paid media?\n- How many people saw my ad (Impressions)?\n- How many people contacted me (leads)?\n- How many people contacted me that were qualified?\n\nWith those numbers you can calculate your Cost per Impression, Cost per Lead, and Cost per Qualified Lead.\n\nIf one of them is a bottleneck, then you can investigate deeper.\n\nBunch of people seeing your ad (impressions) but no one's contacting you? Then figure out why.\n\nAre they seeing them but not clicking to your site?\n\nThat's probably a targeting problem. Make sure the right people seeing them? e.g., let's say you're doing Google Ads, are you bidding on the right keywords, in the right geographies, at the right times? If so, is the ad copy good or generic?\n\nIf people are clicking the ads but not contacting you, then make sure nothing's broken with the page or contact method. Then, make sure your page is convincing? Are you talking like a lawyer or a person? The copy matters more than the design.\n\nSpeak to them problem. Make them feel understood. Answer the questions in advance with the page. Don't be lazy, add video. You don\u2019t need high production here. People just want to hire someone who's real and they can relate to.\n\nMaking it easy helps too. e.g., add a texting option.\n\nDo you have lower commitment offer? e.g., a lead magnet that lets them fill in some info and get a step by step checklist to file themselves.\n\nYou won't lose money doing this. You'll get their info and they will end up hiring you anyway when they realize how easy it is to mess up and file something wrong.\n\n\n**Are the leads contacting you not quality leads?**\nThis can be fixed with better targeting and better messaging. Make it very clear who you're for and not for. \n\nYou can always refer out more complicated cases and figure out how to serve lower value leads with a productized offer. There's a lot of money to be made in high volume efficient delivery...\n\n**Better Software**\nSoftware costs can balloon out of control, but they're usually worth it if you just calculate the cost of your time. That doesn't mean some aren't better than others, though.\n\ne.g., Clio Grow is just bad. Even HubSpot's $20/m Starter plan is leaps and bounds better than Clio Grow (again, Clio Manage is great; Grow is not). HubSpot's Pro Suite isn't cheap but easily pays for itself when you factor in time and labor savings. And it integrates with everything. Lawyers use Clio because it's \"made for lawyers.\" But being made for lawyers and being good are two different things.\n\n**Better Talent**\nSome agencies are good. Some are bad. They should make you more than you're paying them. But don't measure this by the month but using a rolling window.\n\nHave hard conversations. If their cost + ad spend isn't getting you a positive ROI, they need to be able to explain why. Sometimes it's their fault. Sometimes it's yours.\n\nThey should be talking about bookings and clients. If they're only talking about impressions, clicks, and leads, press them harder.\n\nMonth to month contracts are fine. Performance is best. e.g., I only work with solo lawyers and charge them a flat rate per client they sign.\n\nFolks who do pay per lead can be good too. But it can go way wrong when the primary KPI is leads...it's easy to get someone a ton of leads that never become clients.\n\nThose closer they are to the money, the better.\n\n## Reducing Service Costs\nThis comes down to being more efficient and hiring better talent. For most new firms, this starts with streamlining document work.\n\nChecklists, automation, and the ethical use of AI. Create checklists for everything. That's how you'll be able to hire more people and get labor arbitrage.\n\nBut again, worry about making more money first.\n\n**Side Note:** Don't outsource your phone. Everyone seems to want to do this. It's rarely worth it. Don\u2019t let a potential leads first interaction be in the hands of some external company. It's one of the most important moments. Keep it in house and it'll pay dividends in the long run.\n\nI've heard thousands of calls that have a third party answer service...and they are not pretty. If only firms  would call their own number and listen to how it sounds, they might realize how bad it is.\n\nAnd think about it from a potential client's perspective. This firm's website just promised me they care and will fight for me\u2014but when I called they didn't sound like they cares at all...\n\n---\nAlright, there's plenty more I could go into and break down how to actually do all this stuff. DM me if you have questions or just want to chat about it.

I feel like most tools are geared towards PI (bigger money, larger firms, etc) so you will have plenty of options.\n\nWhen I think of a CRM tool, I think about that as being something working hand-in-hand with marketing, following up on leads, prospective clients, doing follow up to book consultations (also sending reminders of upcoming appointments) and then taking the lead to \"client\" status.\n\nI have used a few different tools trying to find the one that worked for me (high-volume solo criminal in Chicago). I tried Clio (hated how many steps I needed to go through to create files and a discovery soldering system which did not appear to have been fixed some three years after I left them) and Clio is about as big a name in the industry as there is. They were huge on being early adopters of integrations with other tools (something I tip my cap to). I then went to Smokeball, which I liked a lot, but at the time didn't have a Mac option, no application for my phone, limited integrations (I see now far more integrations which is great). I then moved to MyCase which was quite good and the recommendation I would make for most people. Certain levels of customization to make it your own, all the tools I would trust firms would need, PC/Mac applications and plugins, they really upped their integrations up as well. What I ran into as an issue was they had a data size cap for individual files (1GB) I routinely have files that go above that and I was stuck uploading to a Google Drive for random large files rather than having my complete file together.\n\nI am currently with Filevine which is the most daunting, but also most customizable option there is. There are upfront costs with them that arent required with other such software, but you really can make it \"your own\" from layout to what sections are called and what order things appear (along with required data to be entered, etc.) but it can take serious time and not insignificant money (2,500-5000 id suspect) to get you off the ground on top of the fees for the base software itself. I do love it and continue to learn and hone the software further for document automation, AI tools that Filevine I feel is at the forefront with, etc.\n\nFor true \"CRM\" as I defined above, there are many of companies that offer similar tools, for a more legal focused version: Lawmatics, LeadDocket, LawRuler. I used the first two. There are companies that then white label Go High Level as a CRM tool (LawHustle as an example). I ended up going to Go HIgh Level and finding a guy through Fiverr who had GHL experience to build out my own tool, with my own workflows while not having to pay a different company a monthly premium to use the tool I can get to on my own. I am VERY excited about how the tool will work for following up with leads via email, text, voicemails, an AI Chatbot coached on my website and the criminal defense book I wrote, all to maximize my marketing dollars, increase show-rate for consultation and make signing clients as easy as possible.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1735881614, "created_utc": 1735881614, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m54z8io", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1hrw62q", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m54z8io", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1hrw62q", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1hrw62q/small_three_person_pi_firm_crm/m54z8io/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1735881629, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "customers hate AI phone", "_search_bucket": "churn_voice_quality", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-01-03"}

I hate clio. In button vLex and FastCase methinks clio can only fuck it up given my terrible experience with clio. \n\nI\u2019ve posted this on other threads and repost here because the same questions come up. So here\u2019s my experience with Clio for five years and Leap since January 2025.\n\nI\u2019ve used clio for 5 years and become more frustrated with it everyday. I\u2019d had high hopes early on and did deep dives on automation training and everything possible to leverage technology.\n\nBut.... Clio document automation is cumbersome and tedious. Tech support gives me contradictory advice from one call to the next. I had to create hundreds of custom fields to track basic data for automation and clio doesn\u2019t let you sort them. Everytime i want to accomplish something easy I'm prompted to buy a subscription app.\n\nClio is a barely glorified Outlook / Microsoft Business abortion of a piece of Crap software platform.\n\nAnd clio grow is even worse.\n\nI even paid a consultant $3,000 to help me automate my probate practice. Money wasted.\n\nI signed on with Leap because Wealth Counsel is packaged with Leap for a total price of $200/month per seat. \n\nI was very wary given my experience with clio.\n\nBut...\n\n... I\u2019m continually impressed with Leap. Document automation is so much easier with Leap than it was with Clio.\n\nFor various practice areas Leap has pre-programmed tables to ID and connect everybody associated with the matter. For estate planning, for instance, Leap features prompts for you to fill in all family members, all heirs, all devisees, all assets of various types, all executors, all agents,...\n\nThen you click a button and it imports all that data into wealth counsel, where you complete the interview and create the estate plan as you normally would with wealth counsel.\n\nSo far, i have not had to create many custom fields in Leap. In clio i would have to have created dozens or hundreds of custom fields by now.\n\nI created a deed template recently for up to four grantors and two properties. Took me about one hour.\n\nYou can even create a replicating table that enables you to program one row in a table and it will automatically create unlimited rows. So if you've got 10 heirs you program one row with the data you need to track for each heir. Then you can get the merge field data for each heir imported directly into the document you need to create.\n\nIn clio you have no such option to create replicating rows, so I\u2019d have to build a form with a custom field for each separate item. Grantor 1, Grantor 2, Grantor 3... . And then custom fields to describe each person and their ownership interest.\n\nSo for a probate Estate in clio i\u2019d have to build out a form with up to 20 heirs, 20 devisees, 20 creditors, with additional custom field sets for each of those 60 items. Overbuild early just in case you someday have an estate with dead heirs and lots of per stirpes fractionated shares.\n\nIn Leap i just right click on the prompt for Heir, add as many heirs as i have with contact and biographical info for each, click on forms and templates, import my basic form, choose replicating table, insert the preprogrammed fields i need (name,address,relationship to decedent, age if a minor, share of inheritance), and it will automate as many rows as i have heirs.\n\nSimple.\n\nSame with deeds. 10 Grantors in a quitclaim deed for 15 properties?\n\nNo problem. No muss no fuss.\n\nI have done 10 or 15 estate plans with Leap + Wealth Counsel and look forward to doing more as i build that practice area.\n\nThere is a steep learning curve to Leap, but once you get the knack for it the software works well.\n\nThere aren\u2019t as many integrations as there are for clio and some others, but frankly i haven\u2019t missed any of them. It integrates with Microsoft 365 Business, various accounting softwares, and a reasonable number of other things. There\u2019s just much more built in to Leap.\n\nAnd the integrations that exist are built-out by leap, so they aren\u2019t as buggy as some of the hundreds of apps available for clio.\n\nI recently switched to VXT Limited for VoIP phone service with AI transcription and summaries that import straight into your matter in LEAP or Clio seemlessly along with a time entry. I formerly used DialPad and it really sucked compared to VXT.\n\nLEAP just released a Zapier integration, so you can make it play with pretty much any app. \n\nI'm going to make it integrate via Zapier with my timekeeping lifesaver, WiseTime. \n\nThe biggest hurdle I\u2019ve had so far is Leap\u2019s treatment of contacts.\n\nYou can create either a \u201ccard\u201d for a contact or you can create a \u201cperson.\u201d Imagine a rolodex filled with business cards and cards for companies.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a card for the White House. You call the switchboard one day and wind up talking to a low-level staffer. You don\u2019t need a new card for the staffer, so you scribble the staffer\u2019s name, email, and direct line on the White House card.\n\nBut a year later you see that staffer on the news as the new White House spokesperson.  You email your congratulations and in reply receive the spokesperson\u2019s new direct line and contact info for an assistant. Scribble that assistant\u2019s info onto your new card for the spokesperson.\n\nLeap works the same way. The \u201ccard\u201d is the family, company, or significant \u201cperson.\u201d The \u201cperson\u201d is just someone affiliated with the \u201ccard.\u201d You may eventually convert a \u201cperson \u201c into a \u201ccard,\u201d but there\u2019s no need to pack your rolodex with a card for every person with whom you come into contact.\n\nThere is a learning curve to it, but it strikes me as much more capable than either clio or practice panther. And when you figure in the sum you'd pay for all of the apps those others would require the price of LEAP is competitive.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in a demo then DM me and I\u2019ll connect you with my Leap account manager. If you're shopping for new practice management tools LEAP should be on your shortlist. \n\nClio offers a referral bonus and i have NEVER even thought to take advantage of it because i so loathe clio.\n\nI maintain a clio subscription only because it works with Wise Time, a passive time tracker that makes timekeeping a breeze. When i get Leap to integrate with Wise Time I'll ditch clio completely.\n\nWise Time does not offer a referral bonus and I encourage you to try it because it\u2019s just that good.\n \nThere are a few Wisetime competitors that I'm trying right now because they're at a lower price point (Memtime, ManicTime).", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1761203459, "created_utc": 1761203459, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nkx20zz", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1oc83v8", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nkx20zz", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_nklosmt", "permalink": "/r/legaltech/comments/1oc83v8/clio_is_unstoppable_now/nkx20zz/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1761203476, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "legaltech", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ypxn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaltech", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "customers hate AI phone", "_search_bucket": "churn_voice_quality", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_general", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-10-23"}

He thought it was impossible to automate such tasks (they were very hard complex for a robot) but he wanted to try with me. On my way home, I started thinking of the frameworks and tools I'd use.

Coming to an end are the days of promising to send in a SME, and some kid with 0 field experience shows up to try to BS some strategy slides in a few days.\n\n2. The dunning-krueger threshold is also being lifted. People that barely understand a topic can have a discussion with an AI that sounds versed, and make the mistake of thinking this equates to having good in-house knowledge. People without skills can't assess skills, so they are stuck thinking that mediocre is good, and won't be able to tell the difference between 5/10 strategy from a bot or the usual 7/10 strategy that come out of consulting. This causes a crisis of communication, in which real SMEs have to work harder to help the lower end of the curve understand that they are screwing up by listening to a low-competence bot. Historically, this is a losing battle, as in the previous iteration, the consulting industry did the same thing by claiming to be the SMEs, to cut out the real SMEs and convince clients to give them the money instead. Now the bots are going to do that to consultants.\n\nThe answer is that the world is a competition, and now the robots have raised the standard. Consultants that want to survive need to get better.

For instance, the distance between GPT-4 and GPT-4o-mini was about 14 months, and in that time they reduced resource utilization by like 14X (going by API costs) while maintaining benchmarks and adding features.\n\nIn general terms, think of our current stage of AI as 3 components. The pre-processing, the LLM stage, and the controller or post-processing. In the pre-processing, the system understands the prompt and can doctor it and direct it to various modules to service it. For instance, if you ask a math question, the pre-processor can pull out a calculator so the LLM doesn't have to do math. If you ask a particularly difficult question, the system can pull out Python and write itself an algorithm to solve it beyond what a normal calculator could handle. You usually don't see this stuff, it happens in the background.\n\nThe LLM stage (the actual language brain) is what we are saying is fairly close to max ability for now. We already fed the architecture all of the world's knowledge and spent years maximizing optimizations. So the current version of GPT-4o, by my guess, is perhaps \\~80% as smart at doing language responses as we are going to get without a significant tech breakthrough... for now as of 2024-early 2025.\n\nThe controller or post-processing stage has tons of promise. In addition to using the pre-processor to help digest the prompt and introduce fancy modules to crunch data, the controller can run parallel processes to hack at a problem from multiple angles. We know from various tests that an LLM responds better if it has multiple chances at the same question. I've seen research that shows that a low-smarts LLM can answer as well as a smart one if it is allowed to refine its own answer 100 times in the background.\n\nWhat the o1 and o3 models are doing is taking advantage of this controller / post-processing approach. They are using their smartest model, and then it tries to improve on its own answers by pursuing various iterations. The underlying LLM is still near some form of GPT-4o, but the result you get comes from multiple versions of itself trying to digest the question from multiple angles and then forming a roundtable of copies of the same robot to analyze everything the robot can do to try to come up with a perfect answer.\n\nOpenAI proved with o3 that if you let the machine eat as many resources as it wants, it gets within range of passing the current AGI tests we have available. This doesn't mean that o3 is AGI, it means that our tests were not expecting the robots to get this smart so fast; and we need new tests that are harder and more precise in what they check for. \n\no3 is still missing proper self-learning and memory systems. OpenAI is for sure working on this stuff but it's not ready yet. But systems like o3 (the proof of concept), or o1 (the current smartest robot available via API), already outclass 99%+ of humans at specific questions and answers on broad topics. How many humans can answer expertly on finance, biology and quantum mechanics at the same time?\n\nAlso, currently o3 eats a crazy amount of resources. The full unfettered version intended to push the limits can use like $100k worth of computing resources to answer a tough question. It's nowhere near ready for prime time as a bot available through an API. But it shows where we are headed with this approach to AI.

Because practice owners want to see it work with their own eyes first before making a decent commitment -- understandably so.\n\nAny sort of categorization, like coding, is an easy win and huge time-saver while still having a manual review after each round. Omnichannel messaging (text, email, web chat) is another great use of AI. The beautiful thing about this is that it's 24/7 + pay as you go. More patients are booking online than ever and availability is money. You can even have a human in the loop approach to ensure 100% transparency as trust gradually builds up.\n\nAnother hidden use case I'm very excited about is waitlist fill-ups and phone call handling with AI. Lot of office staff is burdened by last-second cancellations and constantly handling multiple phone calls. Each missed call is a potential appointment that might've been missed and could go to your competitors. With AI, this is not an issue because it can reach out to many people + handle many calls at once.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about what I said, feel free to let me know.\n\nAI isn't perfect, but there's a lot of potential if people get it right.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1733011545, "created_utc": 1733011545, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lzsl4p4", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1h2x86o", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lzsl4p4", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1h2x86o", "permalink": "/r/Dentistry/comments/1h2x86o/practice_changing_technology/lzsl4p4/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1733011558, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Dentistry", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rpgi", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Dentistry", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "AI loop phone", "_search_bucket": "churn_cant_handle_calls", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-12-01"}

We're expecting huge revenue growth just from after-hours and unanswered calls. Why? Because they serve geriatrics almost exclusively. Senior citizens don't want to text. They just want to talk.\n\nTypically, a practice like this will pay several dollars a minute for a virtual receptionist that's handling calls for multiple businesses. They can easily make mistakes, and of course leave a bad impression because who cares? They're not a real employee of yours.\n\nAnd that's not to mention how most practices don't even account for working hours when their receptionist is on the phone. The practice I mentioned earlier showed me how they MISSED 30 calls DURING working hours. That's just within the hours of 9-5. They're doing high-ticket procedures (thousands of dollars). That's a lot of money being left on the table. This is the definition of hidden revenue that most practices don't realize they're missing out usually because they don't track this type of stuff or just sweep it under the rug as nothing.\n\nYou take a product like the one I've built -- integrates with your PMS to book appts, look up and create patients, can work with a human in the loop for extra safety.. it'll do everything a regular person can plus more with the unanswered calls, 24/7, at literally 5-10x less the COST. It can pick up the phone after-hours or if your receptionist is busy on the phone with another office or insurance after it goes through a couple rings.\n\nIs it perfect?

Some vendors on Amazon sell them with power included. We buy directly from voipsupply and pass on any discounts we get from them to customers. You can also buy the phone from voipsupply they are a good supplier and will help with any defected phones. The POE switch can be placed after modem/router provided by your ISP they are plug and play so no crazy setup or configuring.\n\nYou get all the normal features of a PBX, forwarding, transfer, caller ID etc. call recording, voicemail to email with transcribing, FREE CRM integrations if needed.\n\nOptional features:  \nIVR (Interactive Voice Response) this is so when people call in they can hear a prerecorded voice asking them to press a button to call an ext, group of exts or a dial by name. We hire professional voice actors avg cost is about $50-80 for the recordings.\n\nToll-Free numbers -$7  \nTexting (SMS to app) - $5  \nTexting (SMS to email) - $10  \nTexting (SMS to UI) - $10  \n\n\nAll and all this shouldn't cost you more than $60 to $80 per month for an office of that size. even at our \"full price\", which we never charge, this setup would cost $85 per month.

I assume that if one person is talking to a customer that has called in, another customer is still able to call the dial-in number and talk to someone else.\n\nFor sure, either direct phone numbers or extension numbers are very possible.  The answer to this question is somewhat provider-specific, but technically, inbound call routing can be configued any way you like.\n\n> Other than the physical VOIP-capable phones, what do we need to support this?\n\nA PoE (power over ethernet) switch would be helpful.  Every VoIP phone worth considering can be powered by PoE, so you only need to run one cable to your phone.  If you want your service to withstand brief power outages, you can place your fibre equipment and PoE switch on a UPS.\n\n> Finally, we may need a physical fax machine; it sounds like that can be handled by a separate line and an ATA, is that correct?\n\nIf a physical fax machine is a critical requirement, make sure the service you choose supports two things: ECM (error correction) and T.38 (the fax standard).  Without these two things, you will surely notice performance issues.  Alternately, use an email-to-fax / fax-to-email service, forget the hardware, and save some paper.\n\nLastly, be prepared to replace your router.

And I hate to say this, but since you were the one pushing for this change, I'm sure upper management is looking for you to fix it as well.  I had to read your post a couple times, but I think I know what the problem is and I will give you my recommendations.\n\n- Your sales rep was not lying to you when he said that you can use your own IP phones.  However, you still need to contact your carrier's tech support and confirm that the make/model of the phones you want to use are compatible.  At the end of the day, SIP is SIP, and you just need to get phones that have been tested for interoperability by your carrier.  You should have a PoE switch to power your phones.  If you don't, you will need to order power adapters with the phones as well.\n\n- You should have received a welcome email from your carrier to setup your admin account.  If you did not, you need to contact tech support and see how can access your admin portal.  Once you have access to your admin portal, you will need to manually add each phone to the cloud PBX.  There should be a devices link where you will be able to  select the make, model, and then a field to enter the MAC address.  You will need to do this for however many phones you want to put into production.\n\n- Now that you have the phone make/model that you want to use, you will need to get the SIP registration information from your carrier and configure each phone with those settings.  You will need to get this information from tech support (unless they have some FAQ online that has this information).  Typically, if you had ordered the phones through your carrier, the phones would have been pre-configured and registered to your cloud PBX.  It would have been plug and play as the installation tech communicated to you.  Since you told your sales rep that you wanted to use your own phones, you will need to configure your phones with the correct SIP registration settings.  Those SIP settings would be the username, password, SIP Server address, SIP registration port, backup SIP server if applicable, proxy server and port if applicable.  Most VoIP carriers will push their own configs to the phones once it has successfully registered with the PBX, but the important thing is to get your phones provisioned and registered to the cloud PBX.\n\n- In the admin portal you will need to create your users, build your extensions, assign your users to the devices/phones, create your ring group(s), create your auto attendant, and route calls to your phone numbers accordingly.  Your carrier should have \"how to\" guides on how to accomplish this.\n\n- Since you are up shits creek with no service because you don't have any phones working, you should check with tech support to see if there is a soft phone app available for smart phones, or if there is a web based soft phone.  If those are available, I would go into the admin portal and create all the users with their extensions.  Once the users have been created, a welcome email should be sent to the users to setup their account.  Users can then log into their apps using their email address and the password they created to begin using the phone service.\n\n- If no smart phone app or web based soft phone is available, you should either have your carrier forward your main number to a cell phone so that at the bare minimum, calls can be answered and someone can take messages.  You can do this yourself through the admin portal if you've familiarized yourself with the settings in the portal.\n\n- This will most likely take you 2-3 days to resolve depending on how many phones you want to put into production and whether or not you have those phones on hand already.\n\nHope that helps.

So if I can make GoTo VOIP services work with whatever hardware that is out there that is ideal, otherwise I have to keep Grasshopper as my forward to whatever service I switch to, and end up paying for two services. (Had my 800 number for 8 years and all of our customers know it, so keeping the number is paramount.)\n\nThanks in advance for any advice ya'll might be able to provide!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1718874136, "created_utc": 1718874136, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l9fq1dh", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1d59zbd", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l9fq1dh", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1d59zbd", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1d59zbd/monthly_requests_thread/l9fq1dh/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1718874154, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": true, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2024-06-20"}

Keep in mind, there are a lot completely legitimate business cases for spoofing. For example, your kid's school broadcast calling everyone to tell them about a late start due to bad weather. In this example, a broadcasting service would likely transmit the number of the school so you would recognize it. \n\nUnfortunately the world is focused on phone numbers. Blocking number, labeling numbers, and assigning blame to this problem at the phone number. But the phone number is an ephemerial resource that is meaningless. \n\nScammers are really good at manipulating identity. That's how they get people to answer the phone. They do this with phone numbers. We need to introduce ways to transmit IDENTITY on phone calls. You don't care about their phone number, you care about who they are. You'd do the same thing if someone was knocking at your door. Would you ask them for their address, or their ID? \n\nThere are companies focused on this problem, I work for one of them.

For example, we're planning on doing shared parental leave, and then switching back and forth for who is on sick/nursery emergency duty so our careers are more evenly impacted. \n\nAn added bonus would be to be able to divert calls to one of our phones based on who is calling. For example, say all calls from the immigration office divert to me if I'm lead on that, but all call from 'water babies class' divert to my partner bc they're lead on that, etc. \n\nI've looked at a few VOIP services but am not sure if the above features are covered- it seems that many will divert to 1 additional phone number and you can change that phone number if you wish. This could work for our 'lead parent switch' plan, but feels clunky to me. But, if the lead parent can't answer, it would be important for the other parent to then be called. \n\nArw these things that VOIP can do generally? Is this the right route to go? Thank you for any insight! \n\n_________\nJust some context in case interested:\nBased on our research and experience so far,  this would massively help combat the structural gender bias in babycare. For example, the NHS (we're in the UK) doesn't even have space for 2 phone numbers in their system and really get tetchy if you suggest not putting in the mother's number...thereby ensuring that all baby medical appt arranging falls on the mother, as well as the task of relaying that knowledge to the other parent. Or, for systems that do have 2 numbers, we've heard from a number of friends that even if the mom's number is listed as 'emergency' she'll get called first, and usually only, from the nursery, etc, even if a note has been put in that the dad is on pat leave and she's working/out of town. \n\nSo this tool is an effort to recognise the reality of gender bias in babycare systems and just sidestep them by staying 1 step ahead of ppl's choices to enact that bias :D\n___________", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1712824297, "created_utc": 1712824297, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kz1r4v2", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1bsp5wc", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kz1r4v2", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1bsp5wc", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1bsp5wc/monthly_requests_thread/kz1r4v2/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1712824317, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": true, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-04-11"}

Is it getting dial tone into and out of your home via the internet(like, to your employer?).\n\nIf so, I think this is possible, but you may need extra services-because the head scratcher for me, after looking at this manual is that the Telstra sends analog signal to the port marked phone. That's your Plain Old Telephony Service(POTS). If you have a regular ol' phone, that's where it goes. Your Cisco phone doesn't have anything like that. It needs to go in one of the LAN ports.\n\nSo, here's what I'm thinking. \n\nSomeone picks up the Aiphone on the outside of your building. If you were just a regular chap with a regular phone, this is going to make a call to whatever phone you have plugged in-**even if you don't have local telco service**. That's just basically someone opening up a circuit in the most uncomplicated way-just a step up from 2 cups and a string.  \n\nNow, the next step is how you connect that to the Telstra. My guess is, in a normal scenario, you'd have the phone line from the outside connect to the section marked PSTN(Public Switched Telephony Network-aka, the global phone system) and then connect the \"phone\" jack to anything else. That's how you'd get the aiphone to ring a \\*regular\\* phone. BUT, your Cisco phone is getting service from \\*somewhere else\\*.\n\nIf your being forced to pay for a home phone as part of your building's agreement, the answer may be way simpler-you may just have to have your home phone forward to whatever number is on your Cisco phone.

Were I in your shoes, knowing only what you've put in your original post, I'd consider a few options:\n\n\n\na) ripping that band-aid off, YOLO-ing it and porting the number out. You'll incur downtime of some kind (possibly a week if everything goes right). If you can sync out those contacts into the new system ahead of time, you might not be completely effed (again, message history's gonna be messssssy).\n\n\n\nb) starting a new service with a new phone number entirely. Give out the new number to customers and start using it for everything. Keep the old T-Mo service in place for a while, but shift everyone over to the new system. No downtime needed, but wouldn't be a quick process. Annoying and a PITA to maintain two calling/messaging systems, but would incur the fewest \"oh shit it's all horribly broken and now so is our business\" moments.\n\n\n\nc) broadening our scope and looking into more of a CRM than just a calling/texting service. Example: hubspot, while I think can become cost-prohibitive if you're a small shop and try to scale up, integrates with a bunch of calling services (https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/calling). Zoho might be worth considering and integrates with things like RingCentral and Dialpad (I've not used either in a calling capacity, though RC as a company and website has felt a bit heavy/clunky to me). I don't know what you're using to keep track of all your customer interactions (I'm thinking more like the house cleanings, etc, not just calls/messaging), but it could make sense to try to integrate this into a CRM somehow. Might be totally overkill for your needs.\n\n\n\nd) look for more a service that offers a true sms inbox. I've seen https://www.openphone.com/ (see https://www.openphone.com/blog/sms-inbox/) recommended elsewhere for calling/voip purposes (never used them, no affiliation). Looks like you can import contacts from a csv https://support.openphone.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500009861242-How-to-import-a-large-number-of-contacts-to-OpenPhone though idk what kind of flexibility/options your business needs. Dialpad I think supports shared sms messaging too (again, no experience with them). Actually, more I look into these pages, the more I think this option might be the right answer. Kinda one of the startup-y companies offering an integrated group call/sms solution with a bunch of purple on their website (cause, you know, it's the hot color right now.....T-Mobile pink is sooooo 2010s lol).\n\n\n\nSo, that's what I know.

The specific standards still call for A-LAW compatibility when peering.

The mobile operators offer some AMR-WB compatibility between each other, but it's either internal only or by private agreement between operators which means you will get AMR-WB if you call a Vodafone number from a T-Mobile number, but not if you call a Three number.\n\nThe same stands mostly true for those offering G722. BT digital voice will offer G722 but you have to remember that is BT's digital replacement for the PSTN. Even if it's internal only, it's going to cover a VAST number of users.\n\nThe best way to find out is to ask your VOIP provider of choice. It would be folly to choose an operator based solely on whether they are going to offer wideband codecs, so pick the one that gives you the best service, price, features, etc. If wideband codec between peers becomes a thing, they will offer it as an almost certainty.\n\nOn a side note, I asked this question of Gamma communications when they contacted me about the PSTN switch off and the rep I spoke to said he believed there was some low scale testing going on at the moment but he couldn't expand on what that meant.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1688557367, "created_utc": 1688557367, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jqqug1o", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_14qffvv", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jqqug1o", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_14qffvv", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/14qffvv/voip_uk_hd_calls_to_digital_voice_and_mobile_ims/jqqug1o/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1688557397, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2023-07-05"}

The idea of a ring group is that all phone and ATA's in the ring group will ring until one of them answers the call, and then they will all stop ringing.  In this case the ATA will never answer the call (because you won't connect a phone to it) but it should be able to run the external ringer.  The ATA can even be part of more than one ring group so if you have more than one line coming it, it can ring when any of those lines ring. Note that **if you are using the ATA to feed an old-style mechanical ringer** from back in the \"Bell System\" days you will need to check the ATA's ringing frequency setting, because by default many use 25 Hz which will cause those old style ringers to either ring weakly or not at all.  In most cases you will need to change the ATA's ringing frequency to 20 Hz (if the ringer is an Automatic Electric device from GTE then all bets are off, they used all sorts of ringing frequencies from 16 Hz up to 66 Hz and the ringer may be tuned to one of them, and that frequency will be stamped on the ringer somewhere.  But the Bell System almost always used 20 Hz ringing frequency exclusively).  If the ringer is a modern type with an electronic tone then the ringing frequency is *probably* not a concern, most of those will be quite happy with 25 **or** 20 Hz.\n\nThe trick will be setting it up, and that will depend on whether you have your own on-site phone switch (and if so, whether any of your employees know how to make configuration changes) or whether you are simply getting VoIP service from an outside vendor (and in that case, whether you have to go through that vendor to make configuration changes or have some way to do that yourselves, such as a web-based interface).  Just buying and hooking up an ATA won't do anything unless it is configured to talk to the switch that provides service to all your phones.  VoIP devices are not like older phone equipment where you can just tap into the right pair of wires and hook up your ringer.\n\nThis is also true with some other solutions proposed in this thread.  There is no device you can buy that is going to \"just work\" without configuration of both the device and the switch (local PBX or external) that provides service to your phones.

IPv4 only currently, but if I need IPv6, it should be easy to add.\n\nBut seeing your reference to LCR, \"standard\" and \"prime\" routes (yes, I realize I still got some learning to do), I realize that I omitted one key detail from my question - quality. I do **not** use any compressed voice codecs like G.729, instead I only use G.711 PCMU and PCMA. When I receive incoming calls at my current BulkVS numbers, I get a SIP INVITE message, and the included SDP offers PCMU, PCMA and G729 - I am referring to the offer/answer model of SDP, as in RFC 3264. My inbound call gateway (I wrote my own SIP software) always responds with an answer that accepts either PCMU or PCMA, whichever is offered, but never accepts G729 or any other non-G.711 codec. My outbound gateway (another piece of SIP software written by me) always sends out INVITEs with SDP offering only PCMU and PCMA, no others.\n\nWhen it comes to outbound international routes, I am looking for some that won't butcher my G.711 calls by passing them through some compressed voice codec internally. Assume that the destination country I am calling has its own legacy PSTN that runs on G.711 64 kbps channels internally - I want a clear-channel 64 kbps path from my outbound gateway to the destination country's legacy G.711 PSTN, without any hidden/surreptitious transcoding being done covertly by a \"cheap\" route. Why do I insist on such a transparent G.711 64 kbps channel? One of the reasons I seek such a thing is because I wish to implement 3GPP TS 28.062 in-band TFO (tandem-free operation) for GSM to GSM calls, which is only possible with a clear 64 kbps G.711 channel that no one is mucking with along the way.\n\nAny idea which provider(s) I should focus on if I am looking for someone who will pass my G.711 64kbps voice channel through transparently to the destination country, rather than pass through some compressed codec?", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1680468780, "created_utc": 1680468780, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jepekmk", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_129utdr", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jepekmk", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t1_jep8pqd", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/129utdr/looking_for_an_international_outbound_call/jepekmk/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1687376505, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2023-04-02"}

Long as you understand the risks and put in place things to minimize them with the lack of cluster and node support. I was toying around with the idea of running proxmox or xen clusters to host the PBX VMs and then do some dns proxy to load balance the call requests. But I'd also have to figure out how to keep the working directories synced across them all.. or just have the clusters in a HA failover scenario to give additional failover systems instead of just one. At some point, it just became more beneficial to look at other systems that are already setup for redundancy and hosted to keep this headache and overhead cost off my plate.\n\nAnd I just started providing phone services last year. I only have a little over 100 extensions set with a couple of tenants. With about 50 or so set up in the pipeline soon to be onboarded. So really I'm probably not the best judge. There are other users with a much larger customer base that would have better insight into it than me. There's a user here on Reddit named TheRealNalaLockspur that owns a company called Sipharmony that uses Vodia for its cloud system. I would bet he's the biggest player using the platform you would find around here if you want to reach out. He would be your best insight into the ins and outs of the platform. They have done a lot of in-house dev stuff to really make the platform their own from what I have seen.\n\nI liked Netsapiens enough when I was looking at it. But when it's literally one of the major platforms out there.. It's just hard to justify a company going with you over a larger outfit that provides the exact same phone service. At probably a lower price because they can offset the costs and margins with volume. I think it's better than most other larger providers, but at the same time what differentiates you and them? Apart from support, and pricing, you're literally the exact same feature set and user experience as competing MSPs or VoIP companies in your area. Just my 2c and how I view it all. Definitely not knocking Netsapiens or anyone using it or providing it like OIT, Viirtue, RingLogix, etc. I think it's a solid platform overall.\n\nAs for alternatives I've been looking at a company called Voxo. They fully host everything, are redundant, they have one seat price for partners that include literally everything. Nothing is extra apart from toll-free and international minutes. They also collect, remit, and pay all FCC, USAC, USF, telecom tax bs on your behalf. So you literally only pay a flat fee per extension and that's it. It's a much smaller company than anyone using netsapians, or any of the other big cloud providers. Nextiva, Zoom, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral, etc. But honestly, that's what I like about them. Support is super fantastic. I literally get a response within minutes and they either give me the answer right then and there on how to do something, or connect to my tenant directly and do what I need. Depending on how you look at it, this is great or bad. They can access your tenant info at any given time. So if security is a super critical aspect to you or certain customers and data protection, privacy, etc. Then this approach might be a turn off. Which, this is unavoidable really in any space where the system is hosted by the company. You'd really have to self-host at that point. But I am looking at probably moving my stuff to them.\n\nIf you are dead set on self-hosting there is a new platform that I've come across called SIPSTACK. It's not technically released just yet. They provide a hosted solution right now but are about to release a self-hosted one with more features apparently. It looks pretty nice on the outside. If I was wanting to keep self-hosting my stuff I'd probably wait a couple of months and demo it out to see if it was worth switching from Vodia. But it might be worth it for you to take a look at as well if you're not aversed to trying out new stuff.\n\nOne more issue I remembered about Vodia, they don't have any fully integrated headsets currently (in v68). So if you have a headset going directly to a computer and are using the softphone, the pickup call and end call buttons do not work on the headset. So if a user wants to pickup a call or end a call they have to be at their desk and click the button on the softphone. They aren't able to press the button on the headset itself to do this. This isn't nearly as big of an issue, but again just another minor annoyance to keep in mind during your selection process.\n\nHappy to help with anything else you got", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1679605685, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jdenarh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_11ysz9n", "locked": false, "name": "t1_jdenarh", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_jdcu09b", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/11ysz9n/any_problems_with_vodia/jdenarh/", "retrieved_on": 1681201532, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": ["Vonage"], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-03-23"}

He was right...it's life changing.\n\nYou want three things, huh? Here we go...\n\n1. Rethink why you price projects the way you do. As an example, does your cost to build a website REALLY justify the price you charge? Or are you charging that much because you only have one shot at making money on the thing, and you know you'll have downtime after it's done? Could you lower your price IF you had a 12-month commitment?\n2. For work that is naturally project work, don't just spread the project cost out over the duration. That's not MRR. That's more like providing the client a credit-free, interest-free loan they pay off over time. The idea with pricing is that you want to NOT go underwater in the beginning of the engagement while making more money during future months.\n3. Start pitching MRR solutions. The longer you pitch projects, the longer you'll be doing only project work. Once you're ready, pitch your offering only as a recurring service with a recurring fee, even if upfront work is required. Clients actually like MRR solutions because they smooth the outbound cash flow and provide predictability. \n\nBonus answer:\n\n* You don't have to switch 100% to MRR. Instead, you can charge for obvious project work like building the website and obvious MRR work like hosting and support. Mix and match if you'd like. Some clients will appreciate that because the payments naturally align with the amount of work over time.\n\nI hope that gives you a few things to think about. \n\nKeep at it. MRR will change your life.\n\n\\~ Erik", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1743696864, "created_utc": 1743696864, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ml80fdi", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1jpcit8", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_ml80fdi", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_mkyjww9", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1jpcit8/three_digital_marketing_agencies_181_clients_6myr/ml80fdi/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1743696882, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_switched", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-04-03"}

It\u2019s a Wild West out there and anyone can be anything. The best way to filter them out is if anyone claims they can get you to the first page of Google in a few months they are a scammer because it doesn\u2019t work that way. It takes time and lots of work to do it. We need to build authority with Google and have lots of content on our site that answers our customers questions and satisfies their searches. Or if you ask someone what they\u2019d do for SEO work and you\u2019re given a bunch if buzzwords that you never heard of before or understand, they\u2019re a scammer. Real SEO people want you to know exactly what they\u2019re doing, what it does, why it matters, and how it works. They don\u2019t hide behind obscurity. They are open and thorough with a set plan and proven results form happy clients you can contact as a reference. When they ask me what my SEO guy does, I tell them this:\n\nSEO consists of 2 parts - on page SEO and off page SEO.\u00a0\n\nOn page SEO are things you can do on the site itself. Like the design, content, load times, accessibility, blogging, etc.\u00a0\n\nOff page are things you do off the site. Like building backlinks to your site; citations, social media, guest posting on blogs, etc.\u00a0\n\nTogether these comprise your SEO strategy. I am good at on page stuff like accessibility for screen readers and design and load times. My sites score 100/100 page speed score from google. Google likes my sites because they load instantly on mobile and we get extra ranking online because of it. My SEO partner Adam does the content, backlinks, curations, blogging, ads, etc. so my work in his hands makes a complete SEO strategy to regularly create relevant content about your services and building them efficiently so they load fast and make google happy.\u00a0\n\nSEO is not a short term flip of a switch and your ranking front page. It takes 6-12 months to see the effects of good SEO strategy. It\u2019s a long term investment. For short term gains you run google ads to show up in relevant searches at the top and get seen by your clients at the point they\u2019re looking for your services.\u00a0\n\nSo SEO + ads + social media management is what makes a complete marketing strategy to maximize your reach online and be seen my as many customers online as possible.\u00a0\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an SEO guy or a budget for my SEO guy, What I do is I do searches for my clients keywords in large city metro areas in a different state and open all the top ranking sites. I analyze the keywords they\u2019re using and content, feed it into chatGPT and have it write new content based on that content from those pages and to pretend it\u2019s a copywriter for websites. Then it gives me the content, I edit it to make it sound more human or change sentence structure, and add it to the site. I know what sections I need on a site and what order and what content I need and where to put the keywords. I do this for interior service pages called content silos as well. These content silos are pages dedicated to 1 service. That entire page is all about that 1 service. Like this page I did\n\nhttps://striveptwellness.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/\n\nThis ranks #1 for \u201cmultiple sclerosis therapy Montclair ca\u201d. These pages are how you rank for dozens and hundreds of keywords and have these pages ranking front page for any and every service your client offers. That + my designs + my expertise in making a site load instantly and score 100/100 on google page speed scores and satisfy all of google core vital metrics for ranking I can make a website rank front page.\n\nI can do all that without being an SEO specialist. I focus on the fundamentals and what google wants to see. Sure traditional SEO helps like backlinks, blogs, guest posting, and content creation and outreach. But if you don\u2019t have the budget for that then you can get by focusing on the stuff you can control on the page.\n\nThese content silos are also amazing for running ads to as well. They convert VERY well. Run an ad for interior painting services and send them to the interior painting services page. The user clicks on an ad for that and is taken to a page that talks all about it and they find exactly what they came there for. Most small business owners send ads to their home page. But when someone goes there they have to go  looking for that service they clicked on the ad for. And if it\u2019s not there they bounce. And then the business owner wonders why none of their ads are converting.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s a budget, I\u2019ll use these guys to proofread my ai content and humanize it, edit it, and make sure we\u2019re using the best keywords. Much more affordable than having content written. I\u2019ll have AI put it together then pay them to edit it.\n\nhttps://aireviver.co.uk\n\nOnce I\u2019m off the phone with them, they learned more about SEO in 10 minutes of taking to me than years of people calling them and pitching their bullshit. They appreciate the time and honesty and authenticity I bring. I don\u2019t guarantee them results. I tell them we can do everything we\u2019re supposed to be doing and it\u2019s still not enough. That means it\u2019s a competitive market and you need to do off page SEO and more aggressive content strategies with an SEO person to make a dent in the rankings. In the end it\u2019s all up to Google. And when we\u2019re a new domain competing against domains that have been online for 10 years and built that authority with Google, it\u2019s going to take time and effort to get Google to trust us over them. \n\nOnce you talk to them with actionable steps and the who. What why when where how then you have someone who respects you and your expertise and your work. If you can\u2019t explain what you do to the client in terms they can understand how can you expect them to make an informed decision?", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1710057498, "created_utc": 1710057498, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ku6z2zo", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1bb3qiq", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_ku6z2zo", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t1_ku6xdtm", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1bb3qiq/does_cold_calling_work_for_find_clients/ku6z2zo/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1710057508, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-03-10"}

I love that. Read the answer for almost 3 times and  I appreciate all of the effort and time you took to answer all of my questions.\nBefore posting this question on reddit. I saw one of your comments on some other posts too which was about building a community for agency owners\nI joined to discord channel of this subreddit from that post and also subscribed to your podcast too! Will surely explore that soon\n\nSo at first- reason for my starting this agency. Your assumption is partially correct because my goal is to make money. I am currently 19 years old and I am passionate about making money online. I have tried a lot of things before too. I was building websites, I used to sell SEO backlinking services too, then I switched to build operations and project management systems to agencies\nBut none of then really stick to me because some services were very hard to fulfill like operational systems and some were very commoditized like website design. \n\nI have recently dropped out from university too and I watch a lot of content on YouTube and the service I am currently providing = lead generation. Really appealed to me because every business needs more leads and if I can have a performance based offer, no one should hesitate in working with me( in my assumption )\n\nThat's the reason I have no monetary capital as well to invest in tools. This is the free website I made for my business:\n\nArtileads.typedream.app \n\nNow, I am trying to find someone whom I can work for on performance basis\n\nAnd thanks for the giving me access to asking questions from you.

Scaling a consultancy is tough, especially because it\u2019s such a personal service. Clients aren't interested in generic advice, they want to feel like you understand their specific challenges and can offer tailored, expert input (not something they could easily get themselves from ChatGPT).    \n  \nFrom what you\u2019re saying, it sounds like you\u2019re looking for a way to scale your expertise without losing that personal touch, which is definitely doable. One way some people go about it, is by piecing together a DIY setup: sending out a questionnaire (like what you'd ask during a first discovery call), scoring the responses in a spreadsheet, and then generating a PDF with some feedback based on that score. You can put this together with tools like Google Forms, Sheets, maybe even Zapier or Make. But this can get messy fast, especially when you're juggling multiple clients or want things to look polished and on-brand.  \n  \nThat\u2019s actually why a lot of consultants end up switching to an all-in-one tool like Pointerpro (full disclosure: I work there).

I'm feeling somewhat lost about the nature of my new role and the day-to-day tasks. I'm seeking advice since I just started this week and haven't been assigned to a project yet.\r  \n\r  \nHello everyone! I'm reaching out for guidance regarding my new career in Management Consulting. I'm thrilled to have joined an international consulting firm in a non-English speaking country this week. However, I have numerous questions that I can't seem to find answers to.\r  \n\r  \nHere's my background: I spent the past three years working at an audit firm. My clients primarily consisted of medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of their business activities. During this time, I progressed from a junior auditor to a senior auditor and gained valuable experience.\r  \n\r  \nOver time, though, I found the audit work becoming somewhat repetitive, and with the busy season approaching, I decided to leave this summer. Rather than switching to another auditing firm, I wanted to venture into something new. So, I applied to several management consulting firms and was accepted by one after completing the interview rounds.\r  \n\r  \nThroughout the interviews, I could articulate my reasons for shifting from auditing to consulting and explain what I could bring to the consulting field. However, I struggled to grasp the day-to-day responsibilities of a management consultant. It all seemed quite nebulous, with people using buzzwords (mixing a lot of english words with local language and using a lot of acronyms) when I asked for concrete details about their work. Most responses to my questions about tasks and responsibilities boiled down to \"it depends\".\r  \n\r  \nDespite the uncertainty, I chose to pursue a career in management consulting to gain a better understanding of what a consultant does, and work for MNCs. I'm currently working in a practice that offers Finance Transformation services. I've just started this week, and I haven't been assigned to a project yet (though it's likely to happen next week).\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy primary goal is to understand what will be expected of me, the deliverables I'll be responsible for, and the day-to-day routine of a management consultant. Additionally, I'd like to know which skills will be the most valuable as I'm eager to grow in this role.\n\nSo if you can provide any help or advice, feel free to reply here or contact me directly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a great day !", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1697281446, "created_utc": 1697281446, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "k4tuldl", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_16ru2su", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_k4tuldl", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_16ru2su", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/16ru2su/starting_a_new_job_in_consulting_post_here_for/k4tuldl/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1697281461, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "switched answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2023-10-14"}

Broken bones, surgery, brain injury. You can take fewer of them and really have a good wlb. \n\nIf...\n\nIf only it were easy to GET those cases, luck out by getting fair settlements without paying through the nose for experts, and never have to touch BS cases where the only treatment provider is a flim-flam chiropractor who treats folks on a letter of protection. In those cases you're nothing more than the chiropractor's bill collector. And it sucks. And if your in your own without staff medical records and billing records ordering will drive you bonkers. I had one client treat one time at an ER. One x-ray, one MRI. Nonnarcotic meds. \n\nI had to order medical records and bills from 12 providers for one visit to the ER. It took several hours to track down all the entities from which to get records and bills. And each entity charged a facility fee to process and fulfill the request. \n\nOne quick lesson... In PI if you're writing motions and responses, scouring records, appearing in court, or doing anything other than settling and mediating you're losing money. \n\nThere are two primary models for PI firms (for straight down the middle PI, not the class action / mass tort type).  \n\nIn the first model, the firm only takes a case if the prospective recovery exceeds, say, $100k. The firm targets big cases in its advertising; employs a few paralegals, an office manager, a a receptionist /legal assistant ; and has a few attorneys who work the big cases. The firms have a boom-or-bust setup and sometimes the owner-Lawyers go without pay and /or borrow money to keep the paralegals crushing medical records and the experts on speed dial. Cash flow can be a problem.\n\nBut oh my god it's fun! And seriously injured folks and the family in wrongful death cases are nearly always reasonable and care more about the principle than the money. \n\nThen there are firm's that solve the cash flow problem by hiring a fleet of paralegals, a few attorneys, and a bunch of folks whose only job is the soul-sucking task of ordering medical records. The firm takes every case that walks in the door and mills them into a green powder of cash flow. \n\nWhen they get a big case or a complex case the paralegals run it and the attorneys do what they can. But it's kind of like a public defender setup. You do the best you can, but you've got five big cases, 70 medium ones, and a ton of tiny, boring pieces of shit. \n\nOddly,the small cases are often tougher than the big ones because so much of the injury claim in a small case is pure bullshit. \n\nYour client's car got bumped in a parking lot by a car as it backed out of a space. Your client claims whiplash makes it hard to work, so ADLs, and perform household services. The type of person who sues for such trifling sums is desperate and purely in it for the money. And they'll scrap for every red cent. \n\nBut you've got to ring the bell everyday to keep cash flow and hope for a few bigger cases that are slam dunk policy limits cases. \n\nThe first model is much more fun, but takes high risk tolerance. The second way requires a ton of overhead for physical plant and people. And a huge advertising budget. \n\nHuge. \n\nIn late 2019 I was ready to crush it as a solo. I'd worked 3yrs at the first type of PI firm and the firm lost 2 TBI cases back to back. In each case the firm had ~$140k out to experts. The firm owner fired all the lawyers, cashed in his retirement account to keep paying paralegals and rebuilt successfully. \n\nThen I worked 9 months at the second type, a high -volume PI firm. I'd come to work and the boss would hand me a huge stack of medical records. \"Go defend the client at this depositing. Or maybe were taking a deposition. It's a sprained neck or something.\"\n\nAnd at the deposition of the treating neurosurgeon that day I'd learn that the client broke his neck in three places and needed two surgeries. \n\nAnd when I'd review cases the discovery sometimes included wrong names of parties, errant statements of fact, and worse errors. \n\nAnd then I did med Mal defense for 3 years. It was awful. The top-paying carrier paid my boss a whopping $205/hr. The guy had 34yrs experience in top-tier hesrt, brain, spine, and complex medical cases. He'd never lost a trial. \n\nFor comparison, I charge $310/hr as a solo general practitioner and business attorneys with 35 years experience in my market can bill around $450/hr.\n\nSo... Back to crushing it as a solo PI guy. In late -2019 I had a big ship come in on a case I Co-counseled. I paid off my student loans, paid all office expenses a year in advance, hired who I thought would be a good paralegal/bookkeeper (turns out inept at both), and paid $30k to scorpion design for a Web site, seo, and marketing /ad campaign. \n\nThen the pandemic hit. Nobody drove for 8 months. The phone didn't ring. The established PI firms in my market already had multimillion dollar marketing campaigns and they doubled down to chase away upstart competitors. The PI calls I got were worse than  dogshit and the would-be clients had already been rejected or did by several other firms. And some PI firms started competing on contingency fee percentage. \n\nWhen I brought up the abysmal results to the marketing company I was blunt. \n\n\"In the past 6 months I have generated more revenue with the clothes I put my logo on than I have with this campaign.\"\n\nThe company always hustled me to spend more when I lamented the poor results. They convinced me to buy Google local service ads at an additional cost. I needed cash flow, so I spent $1,500 per month for a probate /estate planning local service ad. And because PI is so competitive the monthly minimum for a PI local service ad cost 2 or 3 times more. \n\nThe quantity of PI calls increased a little, but the lead quality plummeted. I had then cancel the pi local service ad after 1.5 months. \n\nThe qty of probate/estate calls skyrocketed. And the lead quality was pretty good, too. I had just started doing that type of law and found it refreshing to create plans to prevent problems than to untangle clusterfucks in litigation. The more of it i do the more I like it. No litigation deadlines. Rare discovery battles. Collect a retainer and fees. \n\nAnd ...\n\nInstead of having a relationship with a client and o/c for up to several years on one case, each client matter takes at most a few months. Then we do our merry ways until they need something or refer somebody. \n\nAnd it has caused me to branch out into real estate, business, contracts,...\n\nNow I'm winding down my PI practice. I love trial and depositions. I just hate nearly every part of litigation required to get to deposition and trial.", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1674801793, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "j62keru", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_10m5eu0", "locked": false, "name": "t1_j62keru", "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_10m5eu0", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/10m5eu0/considering_plaintiffs_pi_it_may_be_my_only/j62keru/", "retrieved_on": 1676097972, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 7, "_search_query": "cancelled receptionist", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-01-27"}

Software, websites, and marketing are easy to buy later. What\u2019s hard to retrofit is how work actually flows through your firm.\n\nFor family law especially, get very clear on your \\*default process\\* now: intake - consult - retainer - pleadings - discovery - settlement vs trial - enforcement. If you don\u2019t standardize that early, you\u2019ll end up reinventing the wheel under stress and leaking time on non-billable admin. Build templates, checklists, and timelines for your most common scenarios (custody, support mods, contempt, emergency motions). That\u2019s what gives you leverage as volume grows.\n\nOn the business side, start quietly stress-testing your book of business: which referral sources actually convert, who pays on time, and which case types drain energy or cash. Family law will happily consume all your time if you let it, so deciding \\*what you won\u2019t take\\* is just as important as marketing.\n\nTech-wise, pick boring, reliable core systems (practice management, billing, document storage) and resist over-customizing early. Where AI actually helps solos isn\u2019t ''magic answers,'' it\u2019s reducing the planning and drafting tax. Tools like AI Lawyer are useful for first-pass drafting, issue checklists, and organizing facts so your billable time goes to strategy and client management, not rewriting the same motions over and over.\n\nLast thing: start acting like an owner before you are one.

By the time you open in 2027, you want execution to feel familiar, not like a personality change\n\nIf you want to sanity-check one thing first: how many \\*ideal\\* family law matters per month do you actually want, and what does that require in terms of intake and workflow?

SkyKick is a good option.  Your IT provider should be providing this, BUT you should confirm. With Skykick, you can restore mailboxes and calendars in hours after things are encrypted.  Don't sleep on your office365 backup.  \n\n\n3) Make sure to have what is called an IDR solution.  This is just a detection, prevention, and remediation tool.  You can use something like sentinel one or even Microsoft Defender for Business.  \n\n4) This tip has saved our clients a lot of headaches.  Have your IT folks set the logo on your Office 365 login page to your company logo.  Educate staff so that if they don't see the firm logo not to log into that page\n\n5) Get cybersecurity education from a company like KnowBe4.  There are a lot of anti phishing tools that are available.  You can test users and if they fail they get training auto assigned.\n\n6) Make sure your IT department has inTune setup and computers encrypted \n\n7) Firewalls, small firms are great using Meraki's line of products.  Avoid Sonicwalls and Watchguards.  Ubiquiti's gear is okay in a pinch\n\n8) Block all USB storage on computers and use a secure messaging platform like Apprivier \n\n9) If you use Office365 for emails, have your IT firm flag emails that are external.  This will help a lot with spoofing attacks.\n\n10) Stop letting users use personal devices for out of office work, get them firm issued computers and bring them under your security structure.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions here, feel free to pick my brain.

You need to establish *communications rules* with everyone who contacts you. Here are the elements:\n\n**Rule 1: Channel Dictates Urgency**\n\nYou have several communications channels: snail mail, fax (lol legal industry), email, Teams messages, calls, text messages. First, pare them down. Throw away the fax machine.\n\nNext, organize these channels in a hierarchy based on how quickly people need a *reply* from you: emails are non-urgent FYIs, phone calls are \"I am literally in jail right now,\" and everything else goes on a ladder somewhere in between.\n\nFinally, communicate that hierarchy to people who communicate with you. An email footer that reminds people that you only check your inbox twice a day can go a long way toward training people to communicate urgency elsewhere.\n\n**Rule 2: Urgency Dictates Response Time**\n\nNot everything needs your attention right now, or today, or this week, or *ever*. Once you've established your channel system, set expectations on response times. *All* of my clients know to email me reports but to Slack me time-sensitive questions because I've educated them on my process. I clear my inbox by the end of the day, but sometimes I don't address low-urgency items until the end of the week. However, if I get a phone call, I stop what I'm doing to answer it.\n\nIn other industries (like IT) this is called an SLA: a Service Level Agreement. Your clients know that if they email you, they might never hear from you again, but if they text you, they'll get a response that same day. Use that to organize your workflow and help your clients feel like they know what to expect.\n\n**Rule 3 (for lawyers): Have a Backstop**\n\nIf your secretary/case assistant/paralegal doesn't already have delegated access to your inbox, voicemail, and Teams channels, then fix that ASAP. None of this works if you have the constant fear of missing a communication or a filing, so you need a backstop, and it's a good practice anyway. Set the expectation that all of the channels get emptied and scheduled for response every single day so that nothing gets left behind.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps.

Be it referrals, paid ads. I am saying this because SEO is momentum. No body can actually tell whether it will work for you or not till you spend a certain amount of time testing it. \n\nIf you don't have other active channels, this will work as a double ended sword, you might not only loose significant money, you will loose time, which I feel is more valuable. \n\nFirst thing is to figure out how much it would cost to run PPC ads, and what is the cost per click in your niche. If this is within your reach, test it out by targeting keywords that are used by people desperately in need for a lawyer. Many times, PPC firms would go after broad terms just to inflate the reports and very little money is spend on keywords that would actually bring in desperate leads. \n\nSecond thing is to find out if your website/landing page is built to convert. I have seen this on several projects where the website looks like a blog, and the service page content is nothing but huge chunk of texts that no body would read. Treat your service area pages as if you are spending 10k per month driving PPC ads to that single page with 50$ a click. This will change your perspective and you will start treating the page from users perspective.\n\nSadly, there is so much dream selling done in Legal niche by agencies, pushing backlinks as magic bullets to Lawyers just to justify the hefty retainers. \n\nI have worked with agencies who would hire us for 2k and flip it for 8-10k by adding bunch of articles and backlinks which in reality, won't move the needle.\n\nWe have ranked for car accident lawyer terms, competing with big legal firms with massive budgets just based on these 3 things:  \n1. You need to reverse engineer what's working for the top 5 results and try to build a better page than them.  \nBy better page, I simply don't mean more content or backlinks, here I mean engagement. That's possibly the no #1 thing that has helped us achieve results. If people spend more time on your page than the competitors, Google has no other choice but to give you visibility.\n\n2. Focus on user experience and design of your page. The goal is not to drive more traffic, but convert the traffic as well. This is sold by some fancy CRO terms, but in reality its more about common sense. We build wireframes for each page that we optimize and pass that on to the design team. They then build on them. \n\n3. Build authority for your core service area that can get you maximum business. If you are a PI lawyer and you try to build authority for everything under the scope of PI, you become a generalist. It's impossible for Google to give real estate in this niche to a generalist. Instead, build your website authority as a super specialist from day #1. \n\nIn reality, lot of legal marketing agencies simply are white label marketing consultants. The actual work is rarely done in house. Also, if you already have lot of content on your website, stop spending more money on blogs unless you have driven ROI from your existing pages.   \n  \nHope this helps!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1745176705, "created_utc": 1745176705, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "mo4y7kf", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1k3ebzm", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_mo4y7kf", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1k3ebzm", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1k3ebzm/is_seo_actually_worth_it_for_a_solo_law_firm/mo4y7kf/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1745176726, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-04-20"}

I\u2019ve been in PI in CA for more than a decade. Both sides. Currently just about a year in on my own practice. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. About 80% of my cases do not need to be litigated.\n\n2. The Rutter group makes a CA personal injury guide. I\u2019ve used it throughout my career. It\u2019s an excellent resource.\n\n3. Negotiating a PI case correctly requires experience. Value is based on a lot of factors that you can\u2019t really handle without experience.\n\n4. Fees are typically from the gross settlement. My firm does 35% (prelit) and then everything else (special and general damages) goes to the client. But the client has to pay medical bills from that (you are responsible for negotiating and resolving those liens). Client keeps what is left over. Resolving liens (especially statutory liens in CA) can be their own nightmare.\n\n Lastly, the business side is difficult, but what people often don\u2019t discuss is client management. That\u2019s a headache in its own right. Half my clients are easy to manage. The other half call everyday asking for money, they want loans, they want to know why the other insurance company is denying liability when \u201cit\u2019s clearly the other persons fault\u201d, they want to know why they\u2019re not getting a million dollars from a fender bender when they only treated at an urgent care once and then told doctors they were fine and stopped going to treatment. They\u2019re rude. They make threats.\n\nThen there\u2019s staff management. Super hard to find experienced people without paying a premium. Even then, staff have conflicts sometimes. They have lives and aren\u2019t dedicated to your business sometimes. Sometimes you hire someone who seems like a good fit and they aren\u2019t.

Send them referrals and build your referral network.  The vast majority of my successful PI clients will farm out most everything but keep the solid cases.\n\n4. If you aren't already, get QuickBooks online.  Make sure to flag your expenses each day.  This will help you understand your cashflow.  The two biggest issues most small businesses, PI firms in particular, is managing cashflow and intake.  Focus on those two things and cut what you can.  After my first year in business, I learned that I spent nearly $1200 on coffee.  So, I bought a coffee pot for the office.  \n\n5. As to secretarial staff, there is an obsession with a lot of lawyers that they need someone to answer the phone.  You don't.  Everyone expects an auto attendant.  Let your Ringcentral app work for you.  If you are going to get staff, look for someone who can take care of the 100 little things that need to be done each day.  If they can answer the phone too that is a bonus.\n\n6. Check with your local bar association to see if they have a lawyer referral program.  Look at local legal non profits and develop relationships with them if possible.

In my jurisdiction, it\u2019s not uncommon for law firm advertising to be paid for by unaffiliated \u201cmarketing companies\u201d that are comprised by different stakeholders - chiropractors and other first-stop clinics typical.\n\nWhy would chiropractors and doctors pay to advertise for a law firm? Because when those medical providers refer the injured patient to their choice lawyers, those lawyers can negotiate to protect the liens (ie the medical bills) of those providers to make sure they\u2019re paid as-billed. If your jurisdiction has a collateral source rule, bills generated by providers are typically 2-3x higher than what a normal insurance carrier would reimburse, so personal injury patients are much much more valuable to the medical provider than someone paying with Blue Cross, etc. \n\nStill, those providers need lawyers to take the cases and get them paid. So they establish relationships with firms and it\u2019s understood between them that the providers will keep referring patients in exchange for the lawyers protecting their bills. \n\nOnce the scale exceeds a certain point, it can make sense for providers to advertise (and pay for) lawyer advertising to increase the amount of referrals from the firm to the providers. \n\nPeople who defend this arrangement will say everybody wins - the doctors who provide treatment (often to poor/broke patients that can\u2019t afford to pay themselves) get paid top dollar for their treatment, injured people are directed to lawyers who know ostensibly what they\u2019re doing, and the lawyers get more cases. \n\nI\u2019m not aware of disciplinary actions in my jurisdiction against this, but I am aware of firms doing it openly and obtaining their own ethics opinions/white papers that say this is kosher to use in the event the ethics board ever cracks down on this (which will never happen). \n\nThere\u2019s other examples as well - it\u2019s not exactly bribery for a law firm to sponsor expensive events / make donations to certain unions with the understanding that the union reps will funnel workplace injuries back to that firm in return, for example. \n\nI\u2019d be speculating on how your particular case with the auto shop would work, but it\u2019s easy to imagine auto shops getting some financial benefit (indirectly or directly) for referring people to a certain firm. Heck, it probably wouldn\u2019t even have to be a nefarious arrangement- law firms with clients who need auto work can send their clients to the shop, the shop can send their folks to the attorneys, etc.\n\nA lot of these referral arrangements are commonplace among small businesses and really aren\u2019t a problem. \n\nBut there are more unethical arrangements, and you have to keep in mind that a giant PI law firm with thousands of clients directs an incredible amount of local commerce (medical treatment, property repair, etc).

What you're finding is when the core problem is being dysregulated vis-a-vis stifling your emotions instead of processing them, then the cascading impacts they have follow you. I'm not suggesting this piece is mutually exclusive with the autonomy of running your own firm -- I think you can do it regardless and you can do it now.\n\n* The resources that worked for me include the YT channel \"therapy in a nut shell.\" She has 2 playlists. One is how to regulate and process emotions. The second is anxiety specifically. \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXAr5dh23zU&list=PLiUrrIiqidTWje-Oc4uA6LZZO8vSaHaDL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXAr5dh23zU&list=PLiUrrIiqidTWje-Oc4uA6LZZO8vSaHaDL)\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kucxlrh74sg&list=PLiUrrIiqidTVqab7pZivzb-e-tMA8qjd-\n\nThere's lots of other resources but these two helped. Here's sort of the synopsis. \n\n* Emotional regulation is a learned skill; many have been inadvertently taught to ignore/stifle/avoid emotions. \n* There's a biological cost/result if you stifle/avoid your emotions; it makes you physiologically more likely to be more anxious\n* The solution is easy and very freeing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So, I started wondering if maybe going solo was the answer\n\nThe logical part of me thinks that you're replacing one set of problems with another. But you're not reducing the problems. Being good at marketing (that is finding paying clients) isn't something that appeals to me personally so take my comment with that grain of salt. I think it's harder than it looks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m hoping that someone might see this and will relate with their own experience. Anyways, thanks for reading this far.\n\nI worked for a somewhat toxic firm, but I think my experience seems similar to my classmates. It's the \"sink or swim\" training methodology combined with the \"up or out\" so you're constantly proving yourself. There's no real job security so it was easy to give into the constant anxiety. \n\nI had learned a bit more about the physiological impacts -- and solutions to control -- anxiety for the bar exam. I pushed them away for the billable hour, but brought them back when I was just constantly inflammed and burnt out. \n\nOn top of the anxiety lessons, I also learned that getting a productivity schedule also helped me feel a sense of control. I use pomodoro -- you basically block your time and do 1 task in that block. You do as much as you can and then you stop at the end of your timer. It takes a while to figure out how to chain them together and how to break up your assignments. But, you never miss an appointment on your calendar. So, using that logic, you can just knock out assignments that way. \n\nThen I also learned the huge impact and benefit of getting 8 hours of restful sleep. After controlling for medical issues (e.g., sleep apnea is super common; caffeine and alcohol inhibit restful sleep), there's resources on how to get restful sleep if you don't.\n\nGetting and maintaining meaningful social connections is hugely important to mental health.\n\nGetting 30 minutes of exercise is hugely important. \n\nYou can \"multi task\" -- like you can make meaningful social connections but they can be professional social connections. So joining a young lawyers division of the bar goes along way. Finding a mentor outside of your firm can be helpful. Just people you can touch in on a semi regular basis and be present with them and whatever. \n\nYou can do work while on the treadmill or whatever.\n\ntl;dr you need to start with learning how to process emotions, then you need meaningful social connections, 8 hours of restful sleep, and 30 minutes of exercise. \n\nOnce you isolate if your problems are contextually driven (i.e., by working for a firm) then you can make decisions. Maybe some of your dissatisfaction is driven by your own dysregulation because you're sacrificing your human needs for your job.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1710863843, "created_utc": 1710863843, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kvley92", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1bim0h7", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kvley92", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_1bim0h7", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1bim0h7/is_it_a_good_idea_to_go_solo_if_you_dont_like/kvley92/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1710863843, "saved": false, "score": 8, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 8, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2024-03-19"}

I have been fruitlessly searching for a decent paying position in Office Administration, so when I was invited via text message to interview with Adam Marshall at K&L Gates I was super pumped. It did seem too good to be true, for instance they asked me what I would require for payment and I said around $23 an hour, with $19 being my lowest that I could accept. He responded that the job pays $30.19 an hour and it is remote! I was thrilled, but still wary. He did a full interview, all on Teams, with 13 questions including 3 references and their contact info, so I may have just screwed 2 people I used to work with along with my best friend by giving the scam artist their phone numbers!! Next he said I needed to wait for a check he was sending by snail mail, then stopped and sent another text message stating that the accounting department just informed him that it would need to be sent to me through my email instead. Very quickly after getting \"hired by his superiors\", who supposedly reviewed my resume and my answers to the questions asked in the fake interview, I received the email with a check for $2,390.00 to be given to the serviceman who came to hook up my new equipment, including a very fast HP computer. I was over at my mother's house by this time, and we just kept looking at one another like, \"What the Hell? Can this be for real? Who sends a two thousand dollar check to someone they have literally never even spoken to on the phone?\" Next, I was instructed to capture a screenshot of the mobile deposit and send it for the accounting department's records. I did what he asked, except instead of a screenshot (another red flag, no banking app will allow you to take screenshots of your accounts in any way, shape, or form. DUH.), I used my son's camera to capture JUST the deposit info, none of my account info, thankfully. By this time I was beyond suspicious, and when I sent him the message with the fake deposit, he asked me to check and see if the funds were available yet. Hmmmmm, he works for a multi-million dollar company and he is worried about whether the funds are available? Although my bank did make some of the funds available right  away (only $500 of it, oddly enough), I lied and said they were still pending, at which point he instructed me to report to Teams (and him) at 8am tomorrow morning. All of this was happening after work hours, in fact I just finished the process at about midnight, which made it much more difficult because I cannot call K&L Gates and ask for the Human Resources department, or anyone else for that matter since all businesses are closed! Smart thinking on the scammer's part! The really sick part is he told me to \"STAY BLESSED\" after I said 'have a good night' to him. We have no money, I am a 50-year-old single mom of 5 trying to finish my degree, and it is impossible to get a job that pays decently AND that I am qualified for. I am 2 classes away from earning my associate's degree, which is great, but some of these employers are asking for a bachelor's degree plus bilingual for $17 an hour! I am at my wit's end, and this scam just stole an entire day from me that I could have used to job search. I guess I should look on the bright side, at least if they find a way into my accounts, there is no money in there for them to steal! They are going to get a real surprise if they try! I am very interested to see what will happen tomorrow when I \"report back\" at 8am, which I plan to do at my local police station. If anyone is also going through this, please reply to my comment! I would really like to know if they are using similar techniques on other job seekers, and how you figured out that it was BULLSH\\*T! I will also be calling K&L Gates in Pennsylvania(where the check was from) and Chicago(where I am from) to inform them of this sick attempt at reaching peoples' accounts.

If you\u2019re legit practicing your oral argument in the bathroom mirror, go ahead and bill for that. \n\nFinally - others might disagree - but when you\u2019re junior don\u2019t worry TOO much about arbitrary billing limits. Junior people often hear \u201cspend an hour\u201d when they get an assignment. Unless the partner is a total ass, they will be much happier with you if you give them good work product or research and bill 1.5 or 1.9, rather then delivering your half baked westlaw project after exactly one hour. This is also where people eat their own time.  I\u2019ve been doing this for more than 10 years and unless the answer is literally my very first google result, it takes me more than an hour to look shit up. Even if it\u2019s just confirming that the first google result was, in fact, correct.  \n\nIf you realize that you\u2019ll need to completely blow your time deadline, just speak up. \u201cYes I can do that but I think it might require a little longer than X hours.\u201d EVERYTHING takes longer than you think it will. Looking at you, boring as fuck objections and responses to discovery requests. \n\nLast last, even if you\u2019re slammed, do 15 minutes of research immediately after you get a new assignment.  Partners get pissed off if you ask them extremely basic questions on an assignment they gave you days ago. \u201cUh what jurisdiction is this in?\u201d", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1696516842, "created_utc": 1696516842, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "k3kwrub", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1706rma", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_k3kwrub", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_1706rma", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1706rma/what_are_the_things_you_wish_you_knew_about/k3kwrub/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1696516857, "saved": false, "score": 25, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 25, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing"], "_date": "2023-10-05"}

The solutions depend on a lot of information we don't have such as your area of practice, average intake call time, conversion rate, and conversion value. Regardless, here are some ideas:\n\nHow often does a conflict check done by the attorney result in finding a conflict? If it's often, that needs to be done by support staff to eliminate those wasted attorney calls.\n\nHow long does the average intake call take? The goal is to reduce that time without reducing your conversion rate. It seems an easy way to do this is to stop letting potential clients who just want to rant waste your time. Figure out some lines relevant your type of work that can be used to escape clients who want to waste your time.\n\nAnother idea to save intake time is to make an intake questionnaire to standardize the important questions you need answered to assess the case. If the ranters want to rant, then: \"the details of your case are always important but I want to get some basic information first so I can contextualize those details.\" Then, by the the time it's their turn to rant, you already know if their case is crap or not. If they have no case you politely end the call after sympathizing the brief ranting you allow them using the lines from above. If it's a good case you let them rant as long as they want.\n\nYou have 5 attorneys doing intake calls who don't want to be interrupted throughout the day? There are 5 days in the week. Assign each attorney to a day (rotating schedule to account for holidays and busier days if need be). The lead attorney handles intake calls on their given day. I would avoid assigning a backup attorney as 10 consults should not be taking 8 hours and clients can wait 30 minutes for a call back on occasions where it's needed. Unless that impacts conversion, but I doubt it will.\n\nThe best system is probably to have one attorney handle all the intakes. Doing intakes is a skill that can be developed such that you can minimize time taken to make the potential client feel heard, convert more potential clients, and set good expectations for the potential clients who become actual clients.

"banned_by": null, "body": "Finally, THE question I'm qualified to answer! My life has been leading up to this moment. I'm going to drone on a little here...\r  \n\r  \nI left ATC to become a lawyer. I'm obviously a lot older than you; my first day at the academy was in 1982 on the one-year anniversary of the PATCO strike, and I too was a controller in LA, ending up at what used to be LA TRACON on Imperial Highway. I was an excellent controller but frustrated with the culture.\r  \n\r  \nI graduated from a great law school two months after my 40th birthday and found that being a 40-year-old lawyer with no legal experience was not something that anybody was interested in. When I left the FAA, I was married with two preschoolers, and after putting all of us through the ordeal of getting a law degree, to find myself unattractive to employers was crushing. I've now been practicing for 25 years or so and although there was a sweet spot in there where I had enough experience and was young enough to be an attractive hire, I'm now in a position where my LinkedIn profile picture says that I'm too old even though my experience blows away a job description. I'm competing against other people with 25 years of experience who aren't even 50. I want work but I'm having trouble finding it.\r  \n\r  \nHindsight being 20/20 I would have been better off sticking with ATC until retirement. I would have retired 15 years ago, my FAA retirement would have been higher than my salary as a lawyer is right now (which is the most absurd part of the entire exercise), and honestly, it turns out that I really enjoyed working the ATC problems every day. There are intangibles that still make me glad I left--I'm well respected in the field in which I work, I stopped drinking, and I became 95% less of an asshole than I was back then. But man, it's tough. Although, at your age, getting hired as a prosecutor is more likely than being hired at a firm and you'll want to look at Assistant US Attorney positions to see if your FAA time will go toward your federal retirement from the DOJ. But don't think for a minute that you're going to stop waking up every morning and thinking, \"This is unsustainable,\" just because you stopped being a controller. \r  \n\r  \nDon't sell yourself short in your current career. If you're good at your job and empathetic, you ARE helping people. You've forgotten that what you're doing so effortlessly is quite an amazing thing, and it's OK to bask in that a little. It's impossible to see it from where you sit, but you're making a huge difference in people's lives.\r  \n\r  \nI live in a city with a population of over a million. Although LA County pays much better, the pay range for a city/county prosecutor here is $88K to $118K and the average home price last month was $1.3 million.

Second chair cases until you're blue in the face. Do a bunch of hearings, as many as you can get your hands on.

Accounting, IOLTA, payroll, hiring/firing, support staff, etc.\n\nDon't do partners, unless you're the worst one there. Even then, don't do partners.\n\nMonitor how the firm manages litigation files. Forms, software, procedures, etc.\n\nIf you can, try to create bridges with reputable PI firms. You'll know, rather quickly, how things are done from the other side, and which firms do things correctly and which firms skate. Once you switch teams, you'll have built in contacts to help you.\n\nIf you're at a ID mill, you will gain valuable insights. You'll know how to run a law office. Note what's working and what's not working AND WRITE IT DOWN. You'll see, first hand, people getting in their own way. Notate the traps and WRITE IT DOWN. No one wants to be dysfunctional, and many times they don't realize it or see it happen. And it will happen to you. But, you had the benefit of seeing another firm go through stuff from an outsider's perspective.\n\nYou'll also get practical experience on how to operate as a business. Though the models are wildly different, the core is the same. You'll learn about accounting, hiring / firing, firm administration, role of paralegals, etc. Take copious notes. \n\nAs a PI lawyer, you won't bill for time (usually), so your relationship with billable hours and money will be vastly different, and will take a LOT of getting used to. With ID, every second has to be billed and accounted for. With PI, you're spending lots of time vetting cases. And you'll work up tons of cases that fizzle out. If that happens in an hourly shop, you're screwed. It's just part of PI life. A lot of lawyers cannot fathom that.\n\nThe main issue with PI: can you make it rain? Do you know how to market? Do you know how to drum up business? NOTHING HAPPENS WITHOUT SALES. You can be Clarence Darrow of modern litigation. You'll be broke if you can't make the phone ring.\n\nThe second issue with PI: Do you have the money to float? Do you have the cash flow to support a case pipeline? Do you have access to capital? You can have all the cases and skills in the world. If you can't finance a case through appeal, you'll still be broke.\n\nThe third issue with PI: Do you know how to handle cash flow? If you're a spender, you'll have problems. If you don't know finance, you'll have problems. If you don't understand how a war chest works, you'll have problems. PI work is feast AND famine. You'll have fat months and lean months. If you spend everything in a fat month, you're out of business for the inevitable lean month. If you don't have the ability to save for a rainy day, don't do this. PI cases are seeds. You can plant quite a few, some won't germinate, some will. The ones that do might survive to produce fruit, some won't. The ones that do take a lot of time to do so. You have to keep the lights on in the interim.\n\nIf you're going to partner (and I do NOT recommend partnering) get with some other practice areas. Criminal, family, probate are always good. They can bring in steady income to feed the firm while you wait for your cases to mature. Just make sure everyone knows their place, what's expected of them, and that income isn't a guarantee. Make sure they all have a work ethic, and don't have personal issues. Make sure they all know how to market and make rain. Make sure they all have access to capital. \n\nIf not, you're in business with Broke Joe, whose marriage is on the rocks, has anxiety issues, and is so introverted he can't make a phone call to save his life. He'll take off 20 sick days a month, and you'll wind up cleaning up all his messes. He'll be the first to demand draws before you pay the firm's bills, the first to want to raid your trust account, and the last to pitch in if the firm is short. When a client shows up screaming at the staff because he forgot to attend a hearing, you won't be able to get him on the phone (because of course he won't be in the office.)

You probably already know you absolutely must have a separate trust/IOTA account.\n\nHere's how our intake/trust/invoicing goes:\n\nIntake coordinator collects consultation fee and schedules consult call. You may initially do some free consultation calls in order to build the business, but after a while, you'll get better clients by requiring a fixed payment for consultation. No one gets a consult with an attorney in our office without having paid for it before it gets scheduled.\n\nAfter consult call, prospective client decides to retain. Intake coordinator sends engagement agreement which includes our billing practices, and a payment link for the deposit we require before starting any work.\n\nClient signs engagement letter and pays deposit to trust.\n\nWe do the work.\n\nWe bill the work, monthly. For hourly work, client must pay the bill, and their original deposit remains in our trust account until (a) an invoice payment is missed, or (b) we've completed the work, if it's a finite thing (prepare operating agreement, quit claim deed, etc), or (c) the client terminates representation. For ongoing general counsel matters, we're holding these deposits continuously unless a payment is missed or client terminates, or for litigation holding it until the litigation is over. If a payment is missed, we apply the trust deposit and transactional work stops until any remaining balance is paid AND the trust deposit is replenished. For litigation, work can't always stop, of course, so the deposit has to be sufficient. This procedure is in our engagement agreement that they sign at the time of paying the deposit.\n\nFor fixed fee work (e.g. estate planning), we collect the fees up front in trust, and we apply those trust dollars to the invoice once the work is complete. It's not held continuously like for hourly work.\n\nExpenses like postage, filing fees, are put on firm credit card and paid out of operating, and listed as an expense on the client's invoice for reimbursement.\n\nPaying self is direct deposit from operating, with appropriate tax treatment.

Contract/SOW Generation (Eliminating the \"Drafting\" Tax)\n\nMost agencies let deals go cold because it takes 48 hours to \"get the paperwork together.\"\n\n* **The ROI:** You can move from a \"Discovery Call\" to a \"Signed SOW\" in under 30 minutes.\n* **The System:** Use a tool (like Fireflies) to record the call. That transcript is fed into an LLM with your SOW template. It extracts the deliverables, pricing, and timelines discussed and pushes them into a draft in your CRM. Client get one link to sign contract, pay invoice\n* **Result:** You aren't \"writing\" anymore; you're just \"approving/correcting.\" That saves roughly 2\u20134 hours of high-level management time per lead.\n* Ditch the hyped \"AI agent\" build. Use workflows. You need automations that give you ROI, not burn money on maintenance. Use local hosted tools for 7 USD / month like n8n \n\n# 2. Omnichannel Speed-to-Lead (The 5-Minute Rule)\n\nData shows that if you don't respond within 5 minutes, your odds of qualifying a lead drop by **80%**. In 2026, leads are hitting you on IG DMs, WhatsApp, Email, and site bots simultaneously.\n\n* **The ROI:** It\u2019s impossible to staff a human on every channel 24/7. Automating the *initial* triage ensures no lead feels ignored.\n* **The System:** Use an aggregator (like Manychat + n8n ) to pipe all channels into one \"AI Dispatcher.\" The bot acknowledges the lead, answers basic FAQs based on your past data, and-most importantly-books the meeting.\n* **Result:** You stop losing revenue to competitors who simply picked up the phone faster.\n* Make the bot self learn, by providing it human feedback. each day, give it feedback for how it replied. Store these in a vector database. Next days, the bot will reply very close to what you just told it\n\n# 3. High-Value \"Intent\" Scrapes\n\nForget bulk scraping. The real ROI is in **Event-Based Marketing.** \\* **The System:** Set up a scraper to monitor local news or trade journals for specific triggers (e.g., a mall announcing a new renovation or a major tenant exit).\n\n* **The Pitch:** Your outreach isn't \"Hi, we do marketing.\" It\u2019s \"I saw you\u2019re losing your anchor tenant in June; here is how we\u2019ve helped other malls fill that footfall gap.\"\n* **Result:** High-signal outreach that gets a 10x higher response rate than standard cold email.\n* You ca read all the news, filter out your ideal ICP, with cheap scrapers from marketplaces like apify \n\n#", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1768405427, "created_utc": 1768405427, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nzk0f8c", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1q450xv", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nzk0f8c", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1q450xv", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1q450xv/been_bumping_into_automationai_lately_and_wanna/nzk0f8c/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1768405447, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2026-01-14"}

Pricing increased as we grew in size and our overheads increased, plus we were benchmarking ourselves against different competitors.\n\n3.

At our peak, we were sending about 100k cold emails/month per client.\n\nIt is a canonical FACT that, over the last 5-10 years, cold email has experienced:\n\n1. Increasing saturation\n2. Decreasing ROI\n\nWe measured our **MSMB (Messages Sent to Meeting Booked)** rate over the past 5 years. The reason we use this as a north star metric is that, if you know your:\n\n1. Sending Costs  \n2. Close Rate  \n3. LTV\n\nyou can easily calculate your overall ROI using your MSMB.\n\n(Side note: Reply rate and open rate are vanity metrics. Anyone flexing a \"high reply rate\" usually doesn't know what they're talking about, in the same way that a media buyer flexing CPC over ROAS is likely inexperienced).\n\nOver the past 5 years, MSMB has steadily worsened with the following trajectory:\n\n* **2021 and before:** Avg \\~50 emails to book 1 meeting.\n* **2022:** Avg \\~150 emails.\n* **Early 2023:** Avg \\~300.\n* **Late 2023:** Avg \\~1,000.\n* **Early 2024:** Avg \\~3,000.\n* **Late 2024 and after:** Range 2,500 - Infinity. (We literally had clients send 25k emails with zero bookings).\n\nSo, if your cold outbound system has:\n\n1. The ability to send massive volume for a low cost\n2. A large TAM (total addressable market)\n3. A completely untapped product-market fit\n\nYou can still make it work in 2025. The reality, however, is that fewer than 1/10 businesses have this right now.\n\nWe actually had clients profitably spending $50k+/month on Facebook ads who couldn't get a single booked meeting after 25,000+ cold emails.\n\nGiven the decreasing trust from sophisticated B2B prospects, we stopped fighting the inbox and started optimizing for Answer Engines/LLMs.\n\nInternally, we call this building a \"Semantic Trust Graph.\"\n\nBasically, the goal is to structure data across high-authority nodes (Reddit, LinkedIn, Quora, YouTube, etc) so that when a user asks ChatGPT or Perplexity for a vendor, our clients are the cited answer.\n\nAnd, given how the LLMs are now, you can actually start ranking within just a couple weeks (good for the new guys).\n\nSo yeah, cold email isn't 100% useless, but unless you have unicorn-like product-market fit in a totally unsaturated industry, it\u2019s becoming like having a billboard in the desert.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1764636017, "created_utc": 1764636017, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nrsz4b6", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1k5ml27", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nrsz4b6", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_moj97mi", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1k5ml27/has_anyone_actually_got_results_from_cold_email/nrsz4b6/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1764636036, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-12-02"}

I've worked in marketing for almost ten years, and now I work at an AI tech company, Botpress, for AI agents and automating workflows. So this is easily one of my favourite topics.\n\nMarketing is broad and can have so many applications, and there are so many ways AI can help.\n\nWe\u2019ve deployed hundreds of thousands of chatbots, so this is my area of expertise. The most common use cases are AI lead generation or customer support bots. But conversational AI can handle almost anything, both internal and external. \n\nThe main reasons people use chatbots, is for:  \n\\- Lead generation. It's an easy bonus of any chatbot, and it can really streamline the process.  \n\\- 24/7 customer support  \n\\- Multilingual support, providing responses in multiple languages, adapting to the user\u2019s preferred communication style  \n\\- Data collection, chatbots quietly gather details like what customers want, what they\u2019re asking, and how they interact  \n\\- Customer or staff onboarding. A chatbot can provide tutorials, address common concerns and answer FAQs  \n\\- Digital business development representatives. Chatbots qualify leads by asking key questions, segmenting users, and passing warm prospects to the sales team  \n\\- Gathering feedback and reviews. Chatbots can prompt users for reviews or surveys after specific interactions,  \n\\- Simplified event promotion, having a chatbot there to answer FAQs, share registration links, and send reminders.\n\nOur marketing team uses bots and AI agents to:  \n\\- Analyze competitor websites and provide competitive intelligence  \n\\- Send personalized follow-up emails  \n\\- Analyze product signals to suggest who is ready for an upgrade\n\n\n\nAlso, you can use machine learning (the use of algorithms that learm from data\u00a0to automate, optimize, and personalize) for:\n\n\\- Personalized content, on the homepage or category pages, add ons in the cart, which emails a customer receives, or personalize email content based on behaviour, recommending which product should appear in a dynamic block for each person.  \n\\- Email marketing, to predict open rates, and optimize send times, subject lines, or content variations.  \n\\- Predictive analytics. Once trained, the model can\u00a0score new leads, campaigns, or customers in real time\u00a0based on how closely they match past success signals.  \n\\- Customer segmentation, grouping people by behaviour rather than demographic. Such as by browsing patterns or purchase frequency.  \n\\- Churn prediction, to flag which customers are likely to disappear by learning from past behaviour, like drops in usage, skipped renewals, or slow response times before someone leaves.   \n\\- Ad targeting and optimization, steering your funds towards winning combos.  \n\\- Sentiment analysis, it can process massive volumes of open-text feedback from places like reviews, support chats, or social media, and label it with nuanced emotional or intent-based categories.\n\nHonestly, I could write a book on this, so I'll stop here.  \nNeedless to say, I am a huge fan of leveraging AI in marketing!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1758223634, "created_utc": 1758223634, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nexx6x9", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1c4gshb", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nexx6x9", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1c4gshb", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1c4gshb/how_do_you_use_ai_in_your_digital_marketing_agency/nexx6x9/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1758223649, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2025-09-18"}

I have worked in many industries that are very disconnected with little overlap, but almost every single business activity boils down to CRUD: you need a database you can Create, Read, Update and Delete from. Virtually every program and game, etc.; that we use is some kind of abstraction of an \"interactive table(s)\". For 20+ years I have always had the same job, roughly (outside my forays into other weird work), and that is essentially \"make a highly specific and proprietary CRUD\".\n\nCustomers? Appointments? Installs? Leads? These are all just tables of data and the interplay between them is what can give projects life. Obviously, this is not something you can just whip out if you do not have the skill set which is okay, I am just explaining this in the hopes that maybe you can look at your own processes and see what exactly you need.\n\nThe thing that I feel is really insidious about stuff like GHL is when it is also sold as being able to generate leads/sales or do proper lead nurturing. In both cases, they require more resources to get dumped in (advertising dollars in the first, and proper workflows/automations in the second). It isn't that you can't use GHL in any capacity: just that you would light-years ahead of most of your competition if you properly knew what it was and what it was **not** capable of, coupled with what exactly your team needs on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThere are also lots of alternatives and that SaaS space is absolutely flooded with options. Invariably, they will all have some shortcomings. Their own pros and cons. Some employees will want (Software Y) they used at their last company and not (Software X) that you end up choosing, which is also inevitable, so it is important to avoid a secondary trap of constantly searching for a solution and thinking that, just beyond the horizon, an oasis awaits. It is always a mirage.\n\nI look at the process (in solar) like this: you have or generate a lead that is interested -> an appointment setter or the sales rep directly gets in contact with them virtually or ideally at their house -> management tracks these interactions very granular to watch for hiccups -> hopefully the deal converts (customer signs) and heads to your installer or you do the install and continue down the process further with customer retention/service, etc.;\n\nThe hardest part is the first step. You might end up having to dump a lot of uneasy money into various marketing. The internet does not operate the same way it did even a year ago: SEO got massively disrupted by AI, for example, and advertisements in **any** industry can be a crapshoot (even with highly skilled marketing teams and near limitless budgets). \n\nThis whole process can be done on a spreadsheet and a lot of companies end up there, with mountains of spreadsheets everywhere (which doesn't scale very well and can be terrifying from a security standpoint as well as many others - when every rotating staff member has access to virtually all of your valuable leads and customer data at any given moment). \n\nStill, I bring this up because \"Life uh, finds a way\", which is exactly how business works. We just find ways to do it, even when we don't have the tools, companies will have a process down. \n\nThe problem is, once you properly analyze and document your individual process, some sales bro will not even listen and claim \"bro, all you need is (Software Z), it does all of that and throws a bag of chips in the kitchen sink\", which is seldom true.\n\nIf you build your process around one of those softwares (or part of it), you will have an easier time initially but a more difficult time if the software ever stops getting updated, has updates that break your processes, or needs to integrate with something else on the backend that is not already configured by both third parties.\n\nMy honest recommendation is that you just take a close look at your process and see where you need the most help or are dropping customers the most and then focus on a software that solves that problem first - whatever your current bottleneck and pain points are. \n\nEven if you were manufacturing widgets, the software requirements are the same: some kind of CRUD. Most software just dresses this up in a fancy way or has industry-specific integrations that could help.\n\nAnother problem is that if you have some processes and software already, really great solutions like Enerflo might be overkill (and expensive), because they kind of expect you to take the whole process through their software - which might not even be possible if you are not an installer and/or generating the leads. Subcontractor Hub is also nice, but suffers a similar fate in that you will squander tons of resources and time (outside the software cost itself) trying to transition into it: the larger your operations already are, the more tedious and daunting this task can be. \n\nI am always available for consultation (free), if you ever want to privately message me with more specific inquiries. I might not have all the answers, but I might have enough to help you out some in some areas. Once you identify your pain points, and bandage those up, the rest should start to fall in line or flow back like how you are used to. I work a lot in the same industry which is both a boon in this instance, but it wouldn't matter if you were having these same problems with another kind of business: most of my advice is generic and not really tailored to a specific industry.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1735310019, "created_utc": 1735310019, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m41bcg7", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1bwrsgp", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m41bcg7", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_m40l4ic", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1bwrsgp/whats_with_go_high_level/m41bcg7/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1735310039, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_not_ready", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-12-27"}

In a way, the price is the price regardless of how much they have to pay for it. On the other hand, if you want or need the work then you will likely be willing to fit your price into whatever constraints they put on you. Some people have strong arguments on one way of thinking about their budget or the other. Personally, if I can get the budget then I prefer to know the budget. \n\nSo, if you haven't already, ask what them for the budget. There's nothing wrong with asking, and if you don't then you're flying blind. I sometimes use that analogy if someone wants a car, you need to know some details before you can point them in the right direction. New or used, low end or high end, features, etc. A car will get you there and back, but it could be a used Kia or a top in lambo. Apply that example to their project, a Shopify is not like all others, right? What will their budget allow in terms of bells, whistles, options, training, etc? If they have a small budget, you'll propose just the basics. If they have a large budget then you'll give them everything. \n\nAsk to speak to the client. If the design company won't allow it then it's a huge red flag. I long ago stopped working for intermediaries. It never worked out because you're answering to multiple parties, and in the end your client's client, who you don't have contact with, is the decision maker. That's a terrible situation to be in. And also, the intermediary can unilaterally cut you out whenever they want. You want contact, and a contract, with the end-client. If you can't get that and you still want to pursue the deal then you have risk that you should account for in your pricing. \n\nI like the idea of pricing in a set number of hours for support and training. Even better, be explicit about how many hours and what they get when you write your proposal and contract. Be sure to include in your proposal what your rate is for additional support and training, as well as for change orders. (they always want changes)\n\nRE: bumping your cost to come up with the price. Are you adding any value to the project? Are you providing project management, scope management, communications, training, funding (you pay your dev before you get paid), etc? If so, include your time and liabilities in addition to the markup on your outsourced costs. Don't forget to pay yourself!\n\nBefore marking up the price, be sure to identify and quantify the risks of the project. The more risks you can account for, the better. So instead of arbitrarily slapping 40% on the developer's cost, first ensure that all your risks are accounted for in the price, then mark up on top of that for your profit. Shoot, 40% may be too low of a number. Where did you come up with that? Personally, I prefer to 2x to 3x my outsource direct costs because I have a shit ton of other expenses to account for besides just the COGS. \n\nEven better is to not price based on your cost. Instead, price based on the value you provide. As an example, how costly is the problem that your solution will solve? Do you understand the value proposition of the solution you're providing? If it's low then they won't be willing to pay much. But if you're providing a million dollar solution then ditch the cost plus pricing model and instead charge based on a percentage of the value you'll provide via your solution. \n\nI hope that helps.\n\n\\~ Erik", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1721273028, "created_utc": 1721273028, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ldpvesh", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1e5zy7e", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_ldpvesh", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1e5zy7e", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1e5zy7e/dont_know_client_budget_but_i_want_to_win_this/ldpvesh/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1721273046, "saved": false, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 6, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-07-18"}

Should I ditch them all and think of a new one? If yes, have you got any idea?  \nMy outreach methods -  \nSending an email to a brand, ( Have 4 templates they will be included down below ) and wait for an answer. I've seen that you recommended that I shouldn't use my domain email, so I do 50% domain and 50% Gmail. Wait 2-3 weeks and message the brand on Instagram. ( I will try to reach the owners now that you recommended too ). I have sent out about 550 cold emails now, but I got about 5 responses and none of them wanted to go through with anything. I have messaged about 400 brands on Instagram, and the results are way better there. About 1 in 25 brands are interested in my proposition, but after I explain it to them, they just stop answering. This is the furthest I got in half a year.  \nI would try cold calling, but that isn't really an option for me.

A lot of times I can only find info, support, etc. kind of mail. Should I even message those emails? Is there any point of that?  \nThis is everything I have for now.

However, soon it becomes a trap for managers. Focusing only at these two metrics (billable hours &amp; utilisation rates) limits the agency to increase its annual revenue. Because if the agency wants to increase its revenue, it has to increase headcount (to have more billable hours to sell to clients) - which is not always sustainable as you may not be able to control the work (i.e., clients may slow down spend etc.).\n\nIn the first 7 years of my agency, billable time and utilisation was a focus - we initially targeted 90% and quickly realised that wouldn't work (for reasons you have mentioned). We then targeted 80% per production headcount (6 hours per day) with a view to have 60% utilised across all productions staff on average.  In this model, timesheets was still key and it is important to remember that you can't simply KPI/performance manage staff on achieving 6 billable hours a day if they have no control in selling work to clients. Our Account / Strategy team focused on revenue (sale of hours), and our production team focus on delivery (utilisation and quality). For projects, we created detailed scope documentation (pages and pages of functional spec - which the client rarely read in full), granular estimates for each task, and fixed plans to a deadline date - all of which caused tension each time client wanted to make a minor change.\n\nFast forward to last year, and we abandoned timesheets altogether. We also stopped tracking billable hours per staff (however, we still track utilisation rates). Now, the engagement is done using sprints (2 week cycle) where we look at the project objectives, features, stories, and do rough point estimation to say \"We believe to achieve the project MVP requirement, it will take 6 sprints with 4 resources in each sprint\". Clients have flexibility to adjust priorities of scope and we do frequent releases to showcase work (which client love seeing progress every 2 weeks). Our Project Management team use a resource/capacity booking system to track utilisation of staff against projects. This model increased utilisation, motivation and helped the team focus on a single large project. In between big projects, the production team may go to a BAU (business as usual) bench to help with small bits of work for other clients - all of which still uses a 2 week sprint cycles to manage.\n\nFrom a revenue point of view, our Account / Strategy team focused on maximising utilisation  and we have a revenue target per month/quarter/year. But it also has its revenue limitations - as again, you're selling total headcount capacity in a sprint fashion. Last year we started moving our pricing model towards value based pricing. Rather than charging an hourly rate or per headcount per sprint rate, we analyse what value a project creates for our clients (in collaboration with them), and aim to capture some of that for the agency. \n\nFor example, if (through discussions with the client on the financial metrics/performance of the project) we identify that the new project will create $1m net profit per year for their brand, then we explain how we will achieve that (our team, capabilities, activities, deliverables, processes, etc.) and that it costs $500k in fees (and in some cases, we set performance incentives, where if the project achieves more than $1m a year in profit, we get additional incentives). The team is then given 60-70% of the fees to create the best product we can to achieve the client's goals (and it gives us enough buffer to manage innovation, minor variations, etc.). Alternatively, we can do the high level scope, points, and charge per sprint method.\n\nI know you didn't ask about revenue performance - however, I felt it might help discussions with your management team as they are motivated by revenue performance. \n\nHope this helps - and sorry for the long rant...", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1679090819, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jcmgekb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_11totwj", "locked": false, "name": "t1_jcmgekb", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_11totwj", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/11totwj/a_couple_of_agency_project_management_questions/jcmgekb/", "retrieved_on": 1681232280, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-03-17"}

The PREP Method (this is literally the cheat code)** if you struggle with structure just use this for every single answer in a meeting. it forces you to say the most important thing first so people dont lose the plot.\n\n*   **Point:** state the bottom line first. (ex: \"i think we should delay the launch\")\n    \n*   **Reason:** the \"why\" in one sentence. (\"because the api is still buggy\")\n    \n*   **Example:** one quick stat or story. (\"last time we launched with bugs we lost 10% of users\")\n    \n*   **Point:** restate the bottom line. (\"so we should wait until monday\")\n    \n\n**2\\. Stop being afraid of silence** most people ramble because they are terrified of those 2 seconds of silence after they finish a sentence. they fill it with \"um\" and \"uh\" or they just keep talking to fill the air.\n\n**the fix:** when you finish a thought just stop. even if it feels awkward. it actually makes you look way more confident and gives the other person time to process what you just said. if you feel like you need to keep talking literally just bite your tongue.\n\n**3\\. The \"Record and Cringe\" exercise** this is the part everyone hates but it works the fastest. record yourself explaining something for 60 seconds then listen to it back (I like to use an app called Confidently for this, it's in any app store. You get 2 random words and then you have to improvise while it analyzes your face and voice and then it gives you instant feedback on things like articulation, facial confidence and vocal confidence etc.) you will realize you say the same thing 3 times in different ways.\n\n*   improvise a 60 second explanation\n    \n*   listen to it and check the articulation score\n    \n*   do it again and again\n    \n*   Over time you'll notice you naturally start formulating and talking more concisely because of new neuronal pathways.\n    \n\n**4\\. The ELI5 Rule (Explain Like I'm 5)** if you cant explain it simply you dont actually understand it as well as you think you do. before a meeting ask yourself how you would explain this to a smart 10 year old. if you need 5 minutes of jargon to get to the point you already lost the room.\n\n**5\\. Write it out first** if youre in a meeting and you know youre gonna have to speak soon write down your \"Point\" on a sticky note in 5 words or less. keep your eyes on that note while you talk. it acts like a tether so you dont wander off into a 10 minute story about nothing.\n\n**tl;dr:** stop thinking out loud. give the answer first (Point) then the \"why\" (Reason). Use tool to practice improv. use the 10-word rule for summaries and get comfortable with 2 seconds of silence.\n\nsource: i used to be the guy who talked for 20 minutes to answer a yes/no question. it takes practice but you'll get there.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1770212970, "created_utc": 1770212970, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "o3j2g5m", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_vywu66", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_o3j2g5m", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_vywu66", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/vywu66/how_to_improve_communication_skills_how_to/o3j2g5m/", "profile_img": "https://i.redd.it/snoovatar/avatars/f75df7b4-f7f5-44f2-90c0-5fb7603d6a1c-headshot.png", "profile_over_18": true, "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1770212989, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust"], "_date": "2026-02-04"}

The whole case thing has gotten out of control. We always gave cases, but they were relatively simple and straightforward. They were mainly to test whether you understood basic concepts, could structure a process, could do some basic math in your head and approximate (not fall into the engineer trap of trying to be overly precise), and how well you dealt with some pressure and push-back. The idea was to understand how you would behave in front of a client and how you carried yourself.\n\nBefore retiring, I did recruiting at HBS, Booth, etc. as the cases matured and grew in length and complexity. I was always amazed at how \"formulaic\" responses became i.e., here's the part where they restate the problem and tell we what kind of case it is, here's the part where they say can I take a few moments to jot down some notes, here's the part where they look for some confirmation, etc. I'd often push back with comments like, \"I don't buy that that is important, why do you think it is?\" just to see how candidates react. Always amazed me how many people backed off when pressed, even when they were right. I also often asked tangential questions like, \"I'm the client ... tell me why I should hire your firm to do this job?\" Got a lot of deer in the headlights on that one, but it is fundamental.\n\nSaw a deck from Booth's consulting club the other day that was 400 pages of case examples and tips on answering them. Maybe it's different when you're being interviewed by a more junior person, but if a partner's interviewing they are looking for how you are going to interact with a client, what personality type you are, and how well you are going to represent the firm. IMHO.\n\nOf course, completely flubbing the case won't help you either ... \n\nTo answer op's question ... if it's a growth problem stop thinking about how many different \"frameworks\" could apply. Pick what you think is salient, structure an approach to addressing the client's key issues, and have strength of conviction that you are right. Don't try and present the whole laundry list and look to me to tell you if the right one is in there or not.\n\nMaybe I'm just getting old and the consulting industry isn't what it used to be ...

I think the doubt is less about your capability and more about how the last 12 months have been set up to eat your confidence alive. You were asked to run without a harness: no training, poor marketing, zero budget, and the expectation that you both deliver and invent a repeatable GTM overnight. That will hollow anyone out.\n\nA few practical things I would do, nothing dramatic, just work you can start today that rebuilds momentum and gives you something concrete to show:\n\nStart with stories. Pick 3 client wins that actually mattered (renewals, cross-sells, a programme you rescued, a C-suite relationship that led to new work). For each: name the situation, what you did (not the team fluff), the measurable result ($$ value, % increase, retention uplift, timeline saved), and one short line about how you made it repeatable or scalable. These become interview answers, LinkedIn posts, and CV bullets, and they force you to see real impact instead of the fog of \u201cI did a lot.\u201d\n\nYou say you have always hit target. That\u2019s gold. Turn it into structure: average deal size, sales cycle length, conversion rate from intro to win, number of accounts you reactivated, pipeline you owned at any point. Even rough numbers are useful. Hiring managers for BD roles want patterns not magic.\n\nBuild a 30\u201360\u201390 for a Head-of-BD role before you get the job. In interviews, present a concrete plan: how you would fix pipeline, what one process you\u2019d change in 30 days, which hires you\u2019d prioritise, a hypothesis for where to find quick early market wins. This shows you are already operating like a leader and not someone desperate to escape fee work.\n\nUse your network like a market test. Tell three trusted clients and peers you are exploring leadership roles and ask two tactical questions: \u201cIf you were hiring a Head of BD, what woul you value most?\u201d and \u201cWho in your network should I speak with?\u201d Those answers will both sharpen your pitch and surface warm intros.\n\nStart a short, public signal: a 1\u20132 page one-pager on a sales play you ran or a client case study you own. Post a thoughtful LinkedIn note on a lesson learned (real and specific). The point is to create evidence you can point to when you feel the imposter voice.\n\nFinally, practice the language of leadership! Move from \u201cI sold this\u201d to \u201cI built the motion that produced X.\u201d Leaders close deals and design repeatable systems. You already have the raw material (delivery credibility + client relationships). Frame it as system design and you stop sounding like a good seller and start sounding like someone who can scale a sales organisation.\n\nIMO, you are closer than you think. The last year chewed up your confidence, but not your skill. If it helps, I touch on this exact transition (from being the rainmaker to building the machine) in [Beyond Slides](https://mybook.to/hbwgyr). Mostly because I saw so many people who could sell but struggled to sell themselves into leadership roles...\n\nYou have done the hardest bit: kept delivering in a brutal environment.

Deepen the conversation until it's clear that going further would require solving nuanced stuff, then the stage is set for asking to continue as a formal project.\n\nSome comments here are going to be slightly off because of framing it as \"sorry,\" like talking shop is offensive; or framing it passively like \"I'd be happy to take that as a project,\" which is fine but it also sounds like you've stopped the conversation because you think there's a disconnect.\n\nThe approach is to assume they are asking you to help them. Because you have the ability to deliver, and they need this, so why wouldn't they want to generate value? To frame the mentality, think of when you stop for a refreshment in the summer, the vendor doesn't reply with sorry or \"I'd be happy to help.\" They just assume you want a refreshment and talk to you like it's simply about figuring out what product to give you to best serve you. So you want to get into the conversation with a positive attitude and give value, and drive that conversation to the point that it feels like they clearly would benefit from a more dedicated effort and it's time to get more nuanced.\n\nA lot of times, consultants fear if they say something savvy in a few minutes then the value they provide is gone. If all you have to give can be absorbed in a single conversation, whatever you were selling wasn't worth much anyway. IMO, be generous with giving value in conversation, because it amounts to very little without a proper process, and all it really does is position you better as a source of solutions and expertise. The vibe is: if I can blow your mind with a couple ideas in a 15 min conversation, imagine what I can do if you hire me to really get into this for you. So go ahead and blow their mind in a quick chat.\n\nHere is a run that is closer to the bullseye:\n\n\"Yes, that's very interesting because we've been working on a similar project in the last few months and we ran into many of the same issues you are experiencing. We've worked out a few angles that are very useful and we are finding great progress, but it depends on various factors that we'd need to uncover further. I think pursuing this would be very meaningful for your organization. If you are ready to explore it further now, I can put together a project plan for us to work on this. It's going to be great.\"\n\nAlways Be Closing. Provide value, show unique expertise, show the complexity of the project, be excited about the project, confirm how valuable it is for them; once they are optimistic, assume the sale and ask for involvement.\n\nIf you give a bit of value away and there's no sale, you haven't lost anything, not even time. It's a marketing and sales investment. The process builds bridges and plants seeds. Someone that just wanted a quick help today might come back 6 months from now with a serious project remembering how much you helped them back then with a generous chat that cost you nearly nothing.

It helped me improve quickly and feel much more confident going into second and final rounds.\n* First interviews are about s**howing curiosity, positivity, and that you\u2019ve done your homework.** Being prepared and asking thoughtful questions consistently helped me move forward in the process more than preparing the perfect STAR-story.\n* **Final rounds are all about your story and luck**.

It has an AI chat that's connected to Google Search and Google Scholar (academic papers). It's trained to answer in mini essays, so if you ask it a question it will go do research and come back with a mini report using sources. It's pretty neat. There's also a research organizer section for you to build your own library of sources. If you attach PDFs (it can sometimes help find them, or you just upload it yourself), then you can chat with the document or with a collection of documents, and it keeps separate track of your notes and AI chats with the documents.

Intellect is about outcomes. \n\nIf I need someone to verify the risk profile of a financial derivative using algorithmic methods, can you do it? OpenAI o1 can do it and is very good at it. Someone is getting hired to do this work, and my company doesn't care who it is as long as the output is solid. I'll pay a squirrel in nuts if it can do the calculation reliably. Humans and their brains don't have a monopoly on outcomes. \n\nThe flaw of this argument is framing it as if humans \"think\" because they are able to reason their way to a good answer, and the others (robot, squirrel) don't think because they couldn't get to the answer. All these creatures can reason, the question is only if they have sufficient intelligence and knowledge to get to the answer using their own flavor of thinking techniques. The key concern is that human intellect is growing slowly, squirrel intellect is not growing in any meaningful way, but AI is growing its intellect exponentially with no sign of it stopping for the foreseeable future. \n\nOpenAI o1 today can already use its understanding of finance and math to assess risk by formulating a monte carlo algorithm in Python, then run and refine that algorithm until it yields a perfect result. And it can do that in 1 minute. If you think that's not \"thinking,\" I'll respect your right to have an opinion, but when it comes to business outcomes, I simply don't concern myself with what you call what o1 just did.

Read through each page, make comments, edits, give guidance where the storyline was unclear. Call out what you expect at the end of the day - more quotes on this page, an initial market size page, whatever.\n- when the team arrives they should have this marked up pack in their inbox.

Make sure they understand that the instant things stop going as you've agreed, they need to come back to you for help.\n- now the team should be good for a few hours. Use this time to handle process (scheduling, etc.), check in with the partner, and get smarter yourself (read the CIM more carefully, read a good market report, whatever)\n- pull the team back together mid afternoon and talk through what each person has learned, how that changes the answer, and explicitly what they will deliver at the end of the day.\n- brief the partner on the above\n- go home, have dinner, touch grass\n- check in with each team member remotely after dinner - make sure things are on track, get a firm commitment about what they'll send you and when.

Send that to the partner team in the morning, so you have the day to tighten it and can get it to the client ahead of the meeting.\n\nDay 5\n- week 1 check in. \n- whatever happens tell the team it was an amazing update, they should be super proud, send them home early \n- while the team goes home, open back up the main deck from your original storyline, and figure out what needs to change based on the discussion.

AI seemed like it would change the way we handle everyday tasks. But often, it just led to more confusion and didn't deliver what it promised. After navigating through this mess, I've learned which tools really work and which don't and this is really important to know that using the right tools can literally increase your productivity 10x.\n\nBefore you try to find any tools, there are some crucial things to keep in mind:\n\n1. Understand the Value of Time-Saving: The first revelation came when I realized not all AI tools are designed to save time; some complicate simple tasks under the guise of advancement. It's crucial to identify tools that genuinely optimize your workflow.\n\n2. Embrace Experimentation with Caution: Experimentation is vital, but it\u2019s equally important to be critical. I learned this the hard way when an AI logo maker, despite its promises, required more manual tweaks than anticipated, turning \"time-saving\" into a time sink.\n\n3. Seek Community Feedback: I started engaging more with forums and user reviews, which opened my eyes to real-world performances of these tools, beyond the flashy demos. Using discord channels and subreddit reviews can be pretty useful in this case.\n\n4. Focus on Compatibility and Integration: The best tools are those that seamlessly integrate into existing workflows rather than requiring you to build around them. \n\n5. Prioritize Tools That Learn and Adapt: AI tools that adapt to user input and improve over time proved to be more beneficial, enhancing their utility with every use.\n\n6. The Simplicity Factor: Often, the simplest tool provides the most value. A straightforward interface with powerful functionality beats a complex tool that promises the world but delivers an atlas instead.\n\n### This Month\u2019s Top AI Tools That Are Truly Useful:\n\n- Uizard:  An AI-powered design tool that simplifies the process of turning ideas into designs and prototypes with a user-friendly interface \n\n- Replai: Optimizes social media engagement by analyzing posts and determining the best times for publishing to maximize visibility and interaction\n\n- UseChannel: Asks questions in plain English and generates data-driven answers, acting like a personal data analyst \n\n- Dora AI: This tool allows you to design and publish 3D and animated websites using just plain text, transforming static designs into immersive experiences.

It\u2019s hard to explain because we can do a lot of different shit, and with that we are not experts in anything.\n\nManagement consultants usually help companies understand where they are good at, where their customers see them adding value, how they compare against competitors, and where they can actually make money. In theory this should be the CEO\u2019s job, but a lot of management teams are very narrow minded and can\u2019t see outside of their own four walls. Lots of companies are still spending money on products that are losers because \u201cthat\u2019s what we do\u201d.\n\nThe way we do it is we look at a shit ton of market reports, talk to an immense amount of clients, competitors, industry experts and their own employees to try to understand market size and customer needs. After that we tell them where we think they should be and how we think they should approach the market, and if they do it right, which they not always do, we estimate how much money they can make. We also tell them where they are bad and should stop trying to invest. We talk a lot one because some consultants are only good at talking, but for every management consultant that talks a lot there is a larger number of consultants that actually do a lot of work. And clients talk a lot too, especially senior leaders, and ultimately every business\u2019 goal is to make their clients happy. \n\nThis is true for a strategy case, but other cases are pretty similar. Basically telling them what they are doing now and they should stop, and what they\u2019re not doing now and should start doing.\n\nTechnical folks have a hard time understanding this because there is no clear deliverable, and unless they implement our recommendations the company will not be better off after we leave then they were when we came in. Strategic changes take time. \n\nFor contrast, let\u2019s say you\u2019re an IT consultant doing SAP implementation. Yeah it feels great to finish the work with something to show, but after you\u2019re done you don\u2019t know if the client is going to use the right way, or if spending millions to get SAP was even the right thing to do.

I believe I\u2019ve felt something similar to what you're described early on in my career.\n\nI worked for a couple of big consulting shops before co-founding my own firm some years back. I\u2019ve built and managed teams, and interviewed hundreds of people about the practice of consulting. Here\u2019s some insights I\u2019ve learned relating to your story. Take them with a pinch of salt, I\u2019m just a random internet person.\n\n1- Eat what\u2019s on your plate; and dessert will follow. Stop distracting yourself by comparing yourself to your peers. Focus on the task at hand and do good work. The better you are at your job, the more levity you have to be you. If you're bored, ask for more challenging work. \nHowever, if you're half-arsing your current workload the senior team don't see an under utilised genius, the see a problem. Eat what's on your plate, and that will provide you with opportunities to progress.\n\n2- If you're not getting useful feedback it's either because your manager doesn\u2019t want to provide it (e.g., avoiding potential conflict, to busy, don't care) or they don't have the capability (they're poor at giving feedback). \nRegardless of the cause, the outcome is the same for you. In the absence of forthcoming or component managers, you need to find a way to make it easy for them. \n\nI find adapting Daniel Pink's \"two irrational questions\" quite helpful. E.g., \"Dear manager, how might you rate my work on XYZ on a scale of 1-10?\" If the manager gives less than 10 ask why it wasn't lower (proxy for positive feedback), and what would need to change to get it closer to 10 (proxy for improvement areas). Framing the conversion in this way serves to both force a perspective from your manager and give them a simple framework to give useful feedback to you. \n\n3- A great consultant knows that communication and bringing people along for the journey is CRITICAL to the job. Not so good at building relationships? Empathising with clients/colleagues to understand what's important to them? Or, adapting your behaviour to different settings?\n\nThen either get better at it or change careers. These interpersonal skills are essential for a successful consulting career. If these are areas where you\u2019re struggling, you can choose to actively improve or consider whether a different career path might suit you better. Most of this stuff are learned skills, it's awkward at first but I promise it gets way easier over time. \n\nLast thing...\n\n4- Comfort with handling ambiguity is a must for anyone to succeed in consulting over the long term. There are two main types of ambiguity you\u2019ll face. The first one involves dealing with client side ambiguity. each new project brings new problems, but we're trained how to navigate this kind of uncertainty; it's part and parcel of the job.\n\nHowever, there's a second and less understood form; ambiguity regarding one's own career. E.g., not having certainty what industries/companies/locations you might be chucked in to at a moments notice; being staffed on boring/shit projects, or sitting on the bench for extended periods of time. \n\nThis level of uncertainty is not for everyone, and there\u2019s no failure in admitting that. It\u2019s important to understand your level of comfort with ambiguity, as it can significantly impact your performance and satisfaction at work (and life overall!) If you\u2019re uncomfortable with this level of uncertainty, consulting might not be the best fit for you. \n\nI know a a great many super smart, massively successful people who would make terrible consultants, and comfort with ambiguity is a common reason. \n\nI found it quite difficult to manage ambiguity early on in my career. The resulting symptoms of this played out for me by way of most of the concerns you've mentioned. Comfort with ambiguity, is a fundamental component of the job. If you're not comfortable, it impacts all the stuff I mentioned above.\n\nI do hope this has been helpful, and I wish you the very best of luck as you work through things.

Scapegoats are honestly meaningless especially for public companies.  Do you think the Board gives out a \u201cget out of jail free card\u201d because McKinsey was behind a failed strategy?  They do not - the buck stops with management no matter who they might bring in to advise them. \n\nAnd a copy paste from a prior response\u2026\n\n But to be honest, I strongly believe the majority of consulting work does generate value for clients. Consulting didn't become a $1T global industry by accident. Noting that you're at a boutique, and there is often a very high variability in that long tail, you might want to consider other opportunities that fit better for you.\n\nHere's something I wrote the last time \"value\" in consulting (specifically MBB) was brought up:\n\n============\n\nThree areas come to mind where we have the most bang for our buck for our clients:\n\nstrategy\n\nbreaking new ground\n\norganizational change\n\nStrategy - In my opinion, the company's strategic choice - who we are - is the most important decision. When you're big enough, the risk of getting it wrong is astronomical - the cost of consultants pales in comparison. Where consultants bring value is through the an independent perspective of the holistic competitive space today, where it's going, and where the white space is. While the internal people may be talented and knowledgeable about their company, they lack the broader view that a Firm who works across an industry can bring. If I were a Chief Strategy Officer, I'd have the internal team working on a strategy and the consultants creating their own take free from insider influence. Then, bring the two together to blend the best of both worlds.\n\nBreaking new ground - If I were running a business and looking to enter into an area I was not familiar with - whether that be industry or function - a consultancy's perspective would be valuable. They would be able to bring the latest thinking, best practices, and optimized processes that would take us much longer to develop, acquire, or hire on our own. I would not hire us if the new opportunity is a clear adjacency to the core business. To put it in real-world terms, if I were Amazon trying to improve customer engagement via mobile, hiring a consultant would not be on my short list of things to focus on. But if I were Aetna or Sysco, then it could make a lot more sense. Even more so if a company is looking to make moves into new markets or diversified acquisitions.\n\nOrganizational change - I'm not using \"organizational change\" in the way I usually would in this context, but what I'm trying to get at is things like transformation or operational effectiveness that represent a meaningful change for the company. Like strategy, these are typically areas where best practices are helpful and downside risk to the organization is large. The difference is that, as a client, I likely know what the high-level answer is - e.g., cut costs by x%, fix the marketing department, or merge two LOBs. However there is a right and a wrong way to make these types of major structural changes. It makes sense to lean on consultants who have done similar work at many places as opposed to internal people who may never have done it before and/or are colored by preexisting politics. I would use MBB or other management consulting firms (again, price dependent) for the tactical planning portion (do x, y, z to cut costs or merge), but would likely use a more budget friendly firm for the execution / project management of that tactical plan.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAnd if I were to generalize even further from the above, I\u2019d say that consultants can bring value when most of the following is true\u2026\n\na) an external perspective is valuable\n\nb) the need is temporary or project based\n\nc) an important capability is missing in house", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1686528156, "created_utc": 1686528156, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jnudqol", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1477w3i", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jnudqol", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t1_jnu5eiy", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1477w3i/are_there_studies_that_demonstrate_a_firms/jnudqol/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1686528188, "saved": false, "score": 52, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 52, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-06-12"}

Here's the thing too, I used to believe this exactly before COVID, then COVID demonstrated to me how completely invalid this all was. I've never had an issue billing a client for the same exact initiatives for the same amount of allotted hours whether on-site or not. Not sure if the billing structure is much different in strategy, but at least in most implementations I've done \u2014 much of it is already pre-planned, and if directors are somehow not aware of this \u2014 then that's just shockingly ignorant of them. \n\nMy issue with this rhetoric is when you have older directors/executives who have rose-tinted glasses on and are out of touch with what actually drives value. I'm not against all travel (I think based on the projects I've done, maybe 1-2 weeks of travel per given implementation \\[can take about 3-4 months\\] is more than sufficient), but ultimately there are still consulting firms/arms that are still trying to push back to pre-COVID level travels, which is just moronic imho (particularly for something that isn't strategy based).\n\nI genuinely do not see how this helps anyone. You end up burning out your consulting staff on non-value add related work (i.e. travel fatigue \u2014 a person is objectively worse cognitively traveling than not, just look up studies of sleeping in foreign environments), and many of them will oftentimes just find another role with less travel. OR, you end up just having your client blow more money on travel expenditures that didn't need to occur. Doesn't matter as much with enterprise accounts, but with lower-budget non-enterprise accounts? I think they'd definitely appreciate not spending 5-10k to fly me and X number of other consultants out just so I can point out to them a flag that needs to be flipped in the config \u2014 when the same exact outcome could have been achieved with far less effort or costs over a zoom meeting. \n\nMaybe this is a critique of my own product knowledge, but if a complex inquiry is asked of me (in which I don't immediately know the answer), it's a lot easier for me to find a solution faster when I can reference notes on a separate monitor instead of taking it away as an action item to be addressed later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMHO, the people here who complain about WFH and reduced travel requirements should really take a step back and actually look at what drives the bottom line/revenue generation of their role and the associated fatigue with everything you do work-related. If something is fatiguing (very broad usage of this term mind you) but doesn't actually produce anything (especially something you can bill against), I think of it as a NVA generally.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1686517821, "created_utc": 1686517821, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jnts6db", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_s8jj1i", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jnts6db", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t1_jnqfha1", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/s8jj1i/unpopular_opinion_i_miss_traveling_and_the_job_is/jnts6db/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1686517859, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "stopped using answering", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-06-11"}

Either use a three way calling process, or use a Bluetooth call recorder.\n\nThe way I usually do it is I call a special number on my PBX that auto answers, requests a pin. Once the pin is entered it records the call. You then use the iPhone merge call feature to add a call in which you call the person you wish to speak to and whose conversation you wish to record and then combine them into a conference. You then take the recording from the PBX. You should note that the iPhone's conference call feature is network dependent, it must be supported by your cellular service provider. Not all service providers support it. There is also a slight downside to this method in that if the person calls you, you need to put them on hold briefly while you add the call to the conversation.\n\nThe alternative way to three way calling is to have your cell number forward to a number controlled by your PBX, who is then programmed to forward the call onto your cell phone using a DISA type arrangement. That way it stays in the loop on the call, you get the call and the recording starts immediately. If your are the person making a call, you call via your PBX so the call originates from the same number and the PBX calls out again using DISA. The person who either you are calling or called you never needs to see your cellular number. The possible downsides to this approach is that depending on your carrier and calling charge setup, this can result in you paying for a separate call and potentially having the callers number hidden if your PBX is not allowed to refer the caller identity information.\n\nThe other way is as you said, use a Bluetooth call recording device. This is where the device connects as a hands free headset. It basically records the audio and saves them to the device, either to an SD card or it's internal memory. There are two issues with this method. The first is that the call audio must be piped through this Bluetooth recorder, which also means you need to use it as the speaking/listening device. Quite often they are terrible for this with really crappy mics and audio. The second issue is again, they are often generally really crappy. I have honestly yet to find a decent device for this purpose. Every last one I have tried has been awful in some way (Poor audio, mic, doesn't record properly, bad battery life, etc) and there is absolutely no single device I would recommend to you. They aren't usually made by reputable electronics companies. There is another more recent type that works via the magsafe attachment and basically places two microphones over the input and output sections of the iPhone. In my experience they aren't great, and you'd be just as well off holding a audio recorder next to the phone on hands free.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1748299632, "created_utc": 1748299632, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "muf6ek8", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1kw4rb5", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_muf6ek8", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1kw4rb5", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1kw4rb5/best_method_to_automatically_record_and/muf6ek8/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1748299651, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "quit answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general"], "_date": "2025-05-26"}

When email spam was a huge problem, some smart people had the same idea to catch spammers (ie. large trap banks). These are called spamtraps, and the techniques that have been used to make these can be used to make phone spam traps too. I would recommend reading the following articles, which have some good information on what you should try: [article1](https://wordtothewise.com/2011/08/a-brief-guide-to-spamtraps/), [article2](https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/spamtraps-creating-and-seeding/), [article3](https://serverfault.com/questions/317876/how-can-i-attract-more-spammers-hitting-my-spam-traps). Generally however, the process is relatively simple:\n\n1) Acquire a large number of phone numbers. Like a F\\*\\*\\* load. (100-1000, depending on your budget. More is always better.) I recommend using BulkVS. I have had no problems with them before, and their rates are quite good.\n\n2) Terminate all of these into a PBX of some kind. I think that a basic asterisk or freeswitch setup would work well. You can configure the PBX to send these to one or multiple phones depending on how many researchers you have available. You should also enable recording, CDR storage, CNAM lookups, and verbose logging on your PBX box, as this will give you some interesting information about the callers. If you don't know how to do this, I would recommend researching this, or getting someone who can. A proper spam harvesting setup should generate way more spam calls than a single person can handle. You'll also want the additional data that comes from running your own sip server.\n\n3) Wait for calls to start coming in. You'll see that some numbers are \"busy\" and some aren't. Keep track of which ones are witch. Most importantly, ANSWER EVERY CALL. If you can't, ensure that voicemail is set up and works. ANSWER EVERY MESSAGE. You may even want to set up a webhook to auto reply to spam texts. Getting spam calls is like making money. The more you have, the easier it is to get more. Spammers sell lists of valid numbers to other spammers, and their computers detect answering machines and other features usually found on live numbers. When they see that you're answering and responding to their calls, they will add you to their gold lists, and you'll be getting dozens of calls a day soon enough. On the other hand, if the computer detects the three error tones usually found with an invalid number, or hears a phone error message, it will automatically scrub you from their list.\n\n4) Make a list of the numbers that are bone-dry (Less than one call every other day). These numbers likely aren't on any list yet, so you're going to need to give them a kick-start. Start following the seeding techniques listed on the articles above, or devise some of your own. Get these phone numbers out there on social media, on public websites, on lists generally. Use them to sign up for shady services with other companies. Use them to sign up for anything. Use them to call in to tech support scammer popup numbers. I personally think loading them into a fake database breach and sending it out on darknet forums or other hacker sites is particularly smart. I would try no more than 3-5 techniques per number so that you can see what is working and what isn't. It could also generate good research data to see what seeding methods work the best.\n\n5) Wait for results, rinse and repeat. Wait 1-3 weeks for the seeding to take hold. Keep answering every call during this time. After this period, take stock of what has worked, and what hasn't. Reseed the still-dead numbers with the more successful seeding methods. (There's no way to know what will work best in advance. It depends on what the 'flavor of the month' is among phone spam gangs). After doing this for one to three months, you should have a well-seeded bank, and the calls should really start coming in. Once you reach this point, protect these numbers. It takes a while for numbers to get good and seeded like this, and you don't want to let a good trap die, either by spammers realizing that they are traps, or by the underlying phone system starting to return errors. \n\nUsing the above strategy and plan, you should easily be able to go well above 10 calls a day per 100 active numbers, and I fully believe that you could exceed a 100 calls a day per active 100 numbers.. Unfortunately, you're going to get a wide, wide mix of calls. Many/most will be international, and it will take work to break them down to just the subset you are looking for. Many international scammers must partner with local companies to either provide services or get money in and out though. (The FTC/FBI might be very interested in who is acting as 'money mules' for these guys.) You may also want to consider partnering with a smaller local ILEC/CLEC/telco. There are many independent companies across the US, and they have access to huge blocks of thousands/tens of thousands of numbers, plus they can find out who the originating carrier is, so you can really get to the nitty-gritty of the call routing (the LERG is a very interesting thing.)\n\nFeel free to shoot me a PM if you have questions. This sounds like a very interesting project, and I'd love to help!

First, it\u2019s too broad. Are you talking about residential or commercial? Are you targeting agents, brokers, SaaS companies serving the industry, or something else?\n\nI assume you really mean residential real estate agents. If so, here are some red flags...\n\n* Most agents are solo operators. In other words, they pay out of their own pocket and their pockets are quite shallow.\n* They are reluctant to spend money on marketing tools, especially if their brokerage already provides some, like most brokerages do.\n* The majority of agents are unsuccessful and close very few deals per year, if any. \n* You will ride the ups and downs of the industry when things like demand for real estate and interest rates change. In other words, you'll have hard times ahead of you when people aren't buying real estate. This cycle is 100% out of your control. You're not recession-proof at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re committed to this niche, I'd be very clear and intentional about who is your ideal prospect. Answer questions like...\n\n* Residential or commercial?\n* How many properties do they sell each year?\n* What is their average deal size or total volume?\n* How much do they need to make annually?\n* Which geographic markets will you target (e.g., all of the U.S. or New York City)?\n\nGet specific, then figure out where those people spend time and what they need.

Albeit it's a lot of pre-production & production experience but not shy from video editing. For SOME reason, I was thinking I should leave filmmaking aside just as a hobby (because it's mostly for passion purposes), and dive into Digital Marketing from scratch. But after listening to some advice, that wouldn't be smart. I should do something video related. I absolutely do not want to provide on-site/hybrid services because that would mean my physical presence (hence, locally). Relative to a layperson, I am 9/10 in video editing, but when compared to experienced short form editors, I'm probably a 4. But I can learn and speed up my workflow very quickly, as I'm already familiar with the softwares. Only thing that is holding me back is my confusion on what to do and a slow laptop (can always sell some shit).\n\nSo the two paths I see could be:  \n1. I can either get a \\~$110-220/m job as an associate or whatever entry position in an agency & get some marketing experience. Build a portfolio and start my own thing.\n\n2. Or I can polish up my video editing skills and get an $800-1700/m video editing remote job, will miss out on marketing & PPC/CPC ads experience though, but maybe I can figure that out later?   \n  \nThis is where I'm stuck, should I start by providing the video editing services, have a client or two, build their trust, increase my market reputation/referrals/testimonials - and then gradually shift to Paid Video Ad Campaigns?

Get your finances balanced and start building on the side. Get a freelance client or two. Then, slowly expand until you're ready to quit your job and go solo.\n* **Do another Google Project Management Specialization (Coursera), along with my Digital Marketing one it might help me land a better role at some company.** Courses always help, so you should do as many as you  can to learn as much as you can. But in most cases, they will only be differentiators for entry-level positions. Don't expect to get a better pay because you have courses, most other job applicants will have them too.\n* **Learn how to run PPC Ads myself and work as a contractor for some other agency owner.** It's extremely unlikely any agency will hire you as a contractor with no prior experience. Their goal is to spend fewer hours managing their clients by delegating to contractors, not spend more time teaching you the job.\n* **I don't need to learn the technical aspects of running ads myself, as I will be delegating it to a contractor anyways, and just suck it up and try finding clients (after obv figuring out my niche, service delivery, and creating an offer).** You won't be able to hire a good contractor if you have no experience yourself. I've seen this happen over and over, and it literally never works.\n* **Get a remote video editing job with a decent pay, and think about building an agency around that business (will have to sell my phone & camera to get myself a decent editing rig).** If you have proven experience in video editing, this would be the best choice.

I get accused of all kinds of stuff I\u2019m not doing, every time it\u2019s some different outlandish accusation with no proof and sometimes irrefutable proof of the contrary.\n\nYes, I work a soulless government job for one of my sources of income which I\u2019ve basically been quiet quit ting for years and the other I work for myself co-managing a research group studying an online chat therapy service and an AI chat therapy service we\u2019ve developed to make therapy more cheaper and more accessible to the masses (we are blessed with a founder who funds the project without needing to make profit). I obviously have more passion for the latter project.\n\nSo the reason I\u2019m explaining who I am and what I do and what my experiences have been are because based on just this one video, I don\u2019t see what the push back on this guy is about. I totally have not looked at anything else from him yet, but I thought all of his info in the video seemed correct. I\u2019m not all that good on history or some of the other subjects mentioned so it\u2019s possible I\u2019m wrong and it\u2019s bullshit. But I certainly can contest that my experience as an outsider has led me to draw similar conclusions about the US education system and I really have a hard time believing that he\u2019s wrong. \n\nCould anyone enlighten me please? I\u2019m willing to head out any opposing opinions and potentially change my own.

To counter your points which were honestly difficult to discern:\n\n1) Within 2-3 years at McK one would be leading teams; within 5 years I had started my own service line and led roughly ~20 individuals which grew to 60 over a few years in addition to my team(s) which I was directly managing. It\u2019s quite insane for you to be spending 90% of your time managing the bottom 10% of performers; in fact there is a common adage at McK that one should spend the vast majority of time coaching and influencing the middle 60% as the top 20% need limited guidance and bottom 20% will not behaviorally shift. \n\n2) Disrespect was never an issue in my experience at the firm and in fact, the company I am at now has significantly more rough language and behaviors than in consulting. Even more bluntly, when arriving as a McK consultant I was treated with white gloves by many clients given the direct line of communication with the CEO. In cases when clients disrespected my ASC/BAs, which happened 3x in about 10 years, I came down harshly where the Sr. Partner spoke directly with CEO who reprimanded or removed said client. Zero clue how computer screens plays into this, maybe you were just ranting. \n\n3) I\u2019m very confused about what \u201creaching the ceiling\u201d means in your opinion. Seriously no clue. I maintain that my experience in consulting was an incredibly steep learning journey which did not slow as I moved up in rank; in fact, it became steeper moving from BA to AP. None of the projects I worked on (over 50 engagements in 10+ years) had answers predetermined by said client leadership. I had 2 cases where a specific client had political reasons towards pushing for a specific answer, for which the engagement was discontinued as a result, regardless of loss of fees.

The process of creating and activating the Profile for Recruiters to search on their system was the most time consuming - at perhaps an hour+ with the good fortune of a current resume to upload and some pre-existing summaries I could leverage.\n\nBoth discussions were with Consulting Firms engaged in providing an \"Overview/Summary/Assessment/Strategy\" for specific options/approaches to setting-up types of businesses (one a Risk Holding Entity for Insurance and one a Customer Call Center operation).  Calls were 30-minutes and 1-hour, with the first a one-one-one (with additional off-camera people in the room) discussion that was poorly structures and understood by those doing the research.  The second was better researched and understood by th individual conducting the interview and included specific questions that reflected an understanding of the business and objectives of the approach she was discussing.\n\nThe option is an easy way to spend some time and earn extra cash (automatically verified immediately after the timed discussion by GLG with a request to go online, provide your preferred payment set-up by either VISA Gift Card or Direct Deposit to Banking and paid within 1-week of the time spent on th discussion).\n\nMinuses include (as mentioned elsewhere) often times very comprehensive questionnaires that ask VERY detailed questions that include specifics which require an answer and detail.  These are sometimes quite a bit of work and look more like a Survey/Questionnaire in-and-of themselves - and are likely designed by either the Recruiter/Researcher to gather a large amount of detail (often Competitor Solutions, Approaches or known Industry Practices that would give insights as to propensity of use among other companies, types of applications and strategy).  While they do take some considerable time to complete - I find they often do NOT result in any additional questions and are intrusive as a Pre-Screening (likely aimed at getting Freebie Info/Strategy without paying the full amount).\n\nIn terms of Rates (a fair question from anyone, and valid curiosity) - while I have seen the $125 payment/hour to Participants that successfully complete Pre-Screening and are scheduled for a discussion, I was advised by the Recruiter who reached-out to me via a LinkedIN Mail (validates the OP's contact approach) that $250 was more in-line with Rates from Candidates (my Background is Financial Services - Banking, Brokerage and Insurance primarily in IT & Ops with Fortune-300 Companies).\n\nFor Engagements with a MAXimum Compensation, the amount is noted on their Engagement Portal and a \"sliding bar\" is provided with your own stated Rate as the MAX and a mid-point of the Company's Highest Rate.  The Pre-Screen allows Clients to review Resume, Experience and Highlighted Skills in the Summary provided in one's Profile to determine whether they would pay more for specific skills/information.

How would you sell? What would be the reply from the business owner.\n\nIn my previous life, I managed a gas station, c store, rental apartments, etc. Revenue around 5mil annually. Paying employees decent wage or hiring adequate help was always an uphill battle. I had a board that I answered regarding operations. The board, or a business owner, refused to acknowledge how spending money on training, paying above the market, and better benefits would attract the best talent from neighboring businesses. \n\nThis will allow us to form a team of memebers who are the best in what they do. Simple correct, you see the point. I see it. Everyone on this sub will also agree with what I wrote. But the board of partners, or in your case, a business owner refused to see value in hiring enough help or employing the best talent. I could not make them see it. Or they saw it but didn't agree with the benefit it provided compared to cost.\n\nThe conversation went like this.\nMe - If we pay the best dollars we will attract the best talent and employees. Our customer service will go up, less turnover, also by attracting the best employees you are leaving other businesses at a disadvantage. Their employees will be second in competition. Look around us, all fortune 500 always assemble an awesome team. It's the bedrock of a successful business. You pay me top dollars and reap the rewards. We post increasing profit year after year. You give me amazing reviews. If we raise our comp by 20 percent, you can have a team that matches my work ethic and skill. Driven to make this business a success.\n\nAnswer- How will we measure that. Paying more doesn't guarantee the best employee. People come for the lowest gas price, good cook and food. They don't come here for cashier. We are happy with our profit now. It has worked like this for years. \n\nI left after failing to assemble a team that I wished. Having one or two great employees and the rest who have no interest in working for you leaves all the work and responsibility on those two employees. Takes the fun and your passion out. The team doesn't share your passion or care for the success of business.\n\nSo I quit. Now, I am in public accounting. Surrounded by talented people. Amazing mentors and coaches. I tried to build this in my existing job. Replicate this model for a small business. Just like you, I envisioned the benefit of mimicking strategies of Fortune 500 for small businesses and failed to let the owners see my vision. \n\nI hope you succeed. My advice is that small businesses are always run with short term view in mind, scarcity mentality no matter how profitable you are. The business owner does not plan for 5 or 10 years down the road. The business owner doesn't believe this profitable business will last long term. It's always that we are making money. Great, let me stuff my pockets for right now. I don't want to spend it on business. Business is there to pay me. \n\nFor example, I have a great restaurant and am making awesome money. Let say I spend money for long-term ideas as explained above. Six months later, another restaurant opens a block down from me. Now what? This is their fear. Most of these small businesses don't have anything proprietary. This is the fear. Anyone can open next to me.

Some facts to consider: \n\nThe higher in an organization you go, and companies in general, the fewer of those jobs there are and more competition for them.  Higher and higher rank, fiercer and fiercer competition.\n\nPerformance evaluations are designed to squeeze more out of each employee every review cycle and make them feel bad for any small areas of lower productivity. \n\nCompanies are financial instruments, despite whatever technology or solutions (goods and services) they are providing. They are structured so that shareholder value is maximized and the only way the company remains at the top of its industry is to increase its value every quarter or face \\*active\\* devaluation by the marketplace. Even flat growth is considered untenable.  There must be upward, increasing valuation.\n\nIn order to not face devaluation, a company must somehow convince or coerce its workforce to do more. They cannot ever effectively hire at a rate commensurate with the need for quarterly expansion and still increase value. Hiring means money -> out, and there is a lag because hiring takes time. The value has to come from somewhere, and it's not by fair & equal distribution of work.\n\nBy participating in this system, you are giving approval to your company to inflict these pressures on you.  Even if you have the nicest boss and team in the world, those pressures are omnipresent in the economy and will find you eventually.\n\nYou may either participate willingly or unwillingly, but if you wish to receive the compensation that you do, you will need to participate.  Your burnout is immaterial to the company, no matter what they say to you or what programs or support they offer.\n\nSo, what to do?  Find a way.  You can job hop and experience that 6 month to a year honeymoon phase over and over.  You can become very good at enforcing your personal boundaries and become diplomatically skilled to never confront your employer about it and create any tension, but the net result is you have a life outside of work.  You can look for a company where the pressures I wrote about are not extreme and it's more comfortable.  You can grit your teeth and bear it.  You can make waves and \"try to change company culture\" LOL.  You can start your own consulting company or individual practice and take on those market pressures personally instead of having them imposed on you by a corporate structure.  You can change careers to something you consider more fun.  You can work work work to save money and then quit and take a long leave because you want to.\n\nThere are several options.  None of which are finding a way to operate outside of this financial system.  Not for the level of compensation you are getting.  Sure, some people get lucky and write a book or create a bit of culture that makes them rich, or win a lottery.  Probabilistically, that is not going to happen. So, you have to think in practical terms what is going to work for YOU.  I suggest you think long and hard about what you want to do for yourself.  This is my best answer, after being in the workforce for many decades and seeing lots of things and experiencing burnout, myself, and trying over and over to figure out what to do.  \n\nMy best therapy is to always be real with myself, and try to appreciate things at a higher level.  And then, to save as much money as I can, for a rainy day, so that no matter what happens (layoff, firing, quitting, etc.) I am covered for a long time while I figure out my next move.  There is no magic bullet for burnout.

I was told to work there for 6 months but I could see that it was not going to end for another year. I communicated this issue to the staffing and the management but no avail despite other members getting actual projects in between. After a while it occurred to me that was not at all meaningful or impactful and would severely hamper my promotion, yet I decided to work since it had a good visibility and engagement with the leadership. \n\nUltimately at the turn of the year, I decided to pull the plug and take the matter into my own hands. \n\nIt was difficult without a job in hand, but I did and I landed a job in Analytics at one of the big financial services company. \n\n2 months into the job, I am blown away by the culture, diversity (no target schools, everyone welcomed by their ability) and work life balance. \nThe best part is the sheer amount of learning (infinite training sessions and internal courses) and the opportunity to lead the projects. \n\nAt first it doesn\u2019t feel like impactful work, but when i remember the impact shown on diagnostic vs the actual implementation I feel i made the right choice of leaving that MBB.

By that I mean that the client needs to get on the phone with me to talk, or at least has to sit down and write a well-thought-out, well-structured question in an email, one that I might take from 10 minutes to an hour or even two to answer, but still it needs to start by them dedicating time.

However, I\u2019ll give it a naive shot, assuming the best intention in you. \n\n1) I don\u2019t think it is. In fact, I found that the truly successful ones, beyond the business life itself, including other aspects of their lives, seem to be the ones who aren\u2019t. If you only measure income success, there is a mix of personalities, perhaps pretty much reflecting a similar psychological profile as any affluent group put together. So, it\u2019s a mix bag truly. \n\n2) on teammates, I find ways to understand the reasons for the complication. When I feel we are incompatible, then I work towards parting ways with that individual in a respectful but clear way where I don\u2019t seek to interact with them unless inevitable. It happens with more frequency than most may admit. If the complication is more centred on specific views, choices or styles, then I generally seek common ground by openly discussing where we are seemingly divergent. \nOn clients, it truly depends. If they are large clients of the firm, I tolerate a lot more and try to find the good in the situation. It\u2019s certainly not easy. When those are clients that are more transactional in nature, it\u2019s about finding what makes them tick and going along with it. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work and you naturally \u201close\u201d the client or simply stop winning work. It\u2019s good for everyone. \n\n3) my marriage is fine. I wouldn\u2019t blame my work for any shortcomings. I think work only hides a deeper issue. It rarely is the cause. I find that lots of people who face marriage breakdown added to pile of discontentment via work (more as a psychological excuse) than actually the root cause. I don\u2019t discard some folks are workaholics but again, it\u2019s probably a reflection of deeper issues or insecurities. I\u2019ve dealt with some of those and I credit my personal Christian faith as being the cornerstone to turning around my priorities in life to what really matters. I fail often but we are a lot better than many years ago. So, all in all, I think I\u2019ve got a good marriage. \n\n4) I\u2019ve answered this questions many times here and in many ways. I wholeheartedly suggest you read my answers if you\u2019re truly seeking deeper understanding. In a nutshell, I deeply care about my family, community and to some extent general strangers who are struggling in life. In my own ways I find opportunities to prioritise with the right amount of time and financial (as relevant) investment each of those nodes in my network. Basically, God (my faith, my wife and children, my broader family, friends, community, strangers.. \n\n5) that\u2019s indeed a great question. Originally, a few weeks ago when I wrote it, I simply felt in my heart on that day that I could contribute something back to all people wanting to grow in their professional services career. I think I\u2019ve been reasonably successful in mine and still going - with a long way to go, but lots to share and help people around the world.

Some background: I have a MSc in business and computer science and spent the first 3 years of my career at a Big 4 firm working within Enterprise Risk. For the last 2 years, I\u2019ve been working at a huge global security company, and have been responsible for the implementation of a new GRC & Privacy tool called OneTrust. Despite my relative young age, I have a very senior role as I have to liase with key stakeholders across the firm to establish their processes in the new mutual GRC & Privacy system.\n\nAnyways, as with most things, once you\u2019ve been working in the same area/system for a while, you become very good and efficient at it. My work here is almost done as I\u2019ve managed to launch processes for almost all of our key functions across the world to use OneTrust. During a meeting with our Customer Success Manager at OneTrust, they also invited their other customer companies in my region in Europe. Due to OneTrust having been a relatively small player in the market (ServiceNow for example is much more common) I was shocked to see just how many companies actually used their services. Almost all of the questions these employers from various companies had were things I knew the answers to from experience, and quite frankly, I had better knowledge of the system than the OneTrust representative themselves.\n\nIt struck me that, despite me earning pretty okay money (\u20ac75k anually), if I was to become a freelance OneTrust consultant, I would be able to make a lot more by helping all of these huge companies actually implement the system instead of hiring employees for the job, or paying exorbinate amounts to OneTrust for their different assistance packages (which honestly helps with very little).\n\nDoes anyone have any experience of being an independent OneTrust consultant (or similar GRC & Privacy tools)? If so, how easy/hard is it to get contact with companies and \u2019sell\u2019 yourself (in the EU)? How much could you charge them? Any information would be very useful. The work that took me 2 years to accomplish at my current company, would honestly take me about 1 month now as, like I said, I know this product inside and out at this point.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1686826567, "created_utc": 1686826567, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jo7n8c3", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_10eom9z", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jo7n8c3", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_10eom9z", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/10eom9z/interested_in_becoming_a_consultant_post_here_for/jo7n8c3/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1686826595, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "quit answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_switched_away", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-06-15"}

Ruthless, and a kick in the teeth after the effort you've put in.\nI more wanted to answer your comment about the 0.1% of jobs. That's quite bleak, but I think it's also misinformed. Full disclosure I'm not a consultant, and actually having the misfortune to be dealing with some Management Consultant sorts at my job atm, but that has nothing to do with my thoughts here.\n\nThe vast majority of jobs do contribute to the world, just generally in a small, specific kind of way. Everyone serves someone or something. Companies don't pay money for nothing (except consultants, ok just kidding). The world of work is often quite siloed, so it masks the value of the work, but it's there. And I would advise anyone to think about what your work does contribute.\nBuilders build homes for people to live in. A plumber might feel unfulfilled but when my toilet explodes and he fixes it then I think he's a life saver.\nGrocery staff are part of a supply chain that ensures people are fed without needing to tend their own farms, barbers keep us looking sharp, garbage men stop us being flooded in our own filth. Etc you get the picture.\nOk what about office jobs? More siloed sure. But still valuable. Work in the office for an insurance company? That's a vital service which spreads risk and facilitates our modern way of life. You think a single airplane ever takes off with passangers onboard in a world without insurance? Or what about those people whose homes are rebuilt following a natural disaster? Exactly. Sure you're a cog in the wheel, but your contribution positively impacts the world.\nOk well what about the real dirty, \"get money\" sorts. What about Investment Bankers? Well, they are greasing the wheels of the capital markets which supports investment in all sorts of industry's which provide all sorts of value to the world.\nEven you consultants, I'm sure if I thought about it hard enough I'd come up with some good. Might need 3-5 working days on that one (kidding \ud83d\ude02)\nUnless you work for the mafia, your job is probably contributing positively to the world in some small way. We can't all be -insert iconic legend here- but we can and do add value to the world. All of us ordinary decent working folks.

This is particularly important in VOIP where lots of people don't know anything about the technology and therefore cannot possibly know the best way to ask. \n\nIf what I need is a new SIP Provider and I have no idea what a SIP Provider is, how am I supposed to ask for it? Chances are, I'm going to ask about the services and equipment that I have and by eliminating all responses that suggest I need other equipment or services, you have made it impossible for me to every find out about a SIP provider in /rVOIP. That's  a terrible policy.  \n\n\nBy eliminating answers that offer a suggestion of a better solution that doesn't match the questoin parameters, the user can realize this and choose to do with it what they want. I, for one, would always want to know if there was a better solution to a problem that would allow me to bypass the equipment I was asking about. That seems like common sense to me.  \n\n\nAlso, I don't see the advanced community rules that the MOD suggested. I READ THE RULES and quoted them here.

The client isn\u2019t ethical. E.g., they \u201cforget\u201d to report all or some sales, or they \u201cmiscategorize\u201d sales so you don\u2019t get credit)\n\nAnd\u2026\n\n2. They have the brand power to drive sales. As an example, they may have a terrible reputation in the community that requires remediation before you\u2019d have any success with them. \n\nAnd\u2026\n\n3. They do the basics to convert leads to sales. I can\u2019t tell you how many times we\u2019ve found that clients aren\u2019t answering calls we sent them from hot leads. Lack of any follow-up is another common problem. Guess who they blame for their sales incompetence?\n\nAnd\u2026\n\n4. They provide a quality service to your lead. If not, the lead/customer may not pay, they may pay less than the sales price, they may get a refund, etc.\n\nAnd\u2026\n\n5. The client ACTUALLY gets paid.\n\nAll of the above are 100% out of your control. You accept a ton of risk for arguably little reward.\n\nI would only advise doing something like this if you have worked with the client for some time, and are sure they don\u2019t have any of the above common problems that the vast majority of businesses have.\n\nAlso, only do something if you are rock-solid confident in your ability to deliver. I don\u2019t mean having blind faith that you\u2019ll rise to the occasion. I mean you\u2019ve done it dozens of times, you know very specifically what you\u2019re getting into, and you know exactly what it will take of you and the client to pull it off. Think science, not emotion. \n\nLastly, you must get full buy-in from the client that they will do their part. Not a token \u201cyah sure,\u201d - a contractual obligation do so with a penalty if they don\u2019t fulfill their end of the agreement (you\u2019ll have wasted your time and money if they don\u2019t).\n\nIf I were in your position, I would opt for a combination of what u/willmanracing and u/its_akhil_mishra have recommended.\n\n1. Lower your base recurring fees. \n\n2. Ask the client to increase ad spend.\n\n3. Negotiation to get paid per lead. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t get into the business of calling my clients customers to qualify them. That\u2019s time consuming, you\u2019ll likely have trouble reaching many of them, and it\u2019s messy AF. In the end, it won\u2019t matter when your client disagrees with your assessment that a prospect is qualified. \n\nSell leads if anything. I\u2019d avoid selling leads that the client says are good leads (remember, they have to do all of those five things above to make this worthwhile for you, and if they\u2019re unethical it\u2019ll be easy for them to wave their hand and say a lead sucks). It\u2019s stay clear of selling revenue. \n\nTo that last point, NEVER link your payment to their profit or profit per lead you send them. It\u2019s almost impossible for business owners to accurately determine profit per customer, and requires substantial assumption of activity base costing that are literally none of your business. Their profit is 100% out of your control even if you could control their revenue.\n\nI hope that gives you a few things to think about and helps.\n\nRegardless of your decision, do us a favor and circle back at some point to let us know how it went. \n\n~ Erik\n\nP.S.

They currently have four phone lines (one of which is fax) through their ISP. The fax line I can split off to a hipaa-compliant service, and they really only need two phone lines, not three. Two users. Nothing fancy, minimal needs. Outbound calling used around 600-700 minutes over the last month (not sure about inbound). I'm located a few hours away, so I can't really provide in-person support.\n\n  \nThere's so much out there to try to make sense of. Again, it's a small shop, and I'm not well-versed in phone/voip (yet). We need auto-attendant (press 1 for X, press 2 for Y), but that's about it. Maybe voicemail / call transferring (receptionist picks up, transfers the call). Current after-hours system is to send a page to one of the users. No need for AI or anything big and complicated.\n\n\n\nI've been looking at Google Workspace/Voice, O365/Teams Phone, Grasshopper, Dialpad, that kind of stuff. My users currently have physical phones, and while simplicity is certainly welcome, I don't think headsets/headphones are any kind of dealbreaker.\n\n\n\nWe currently use MS word/excel but don't have any subscriptions (standalone licenses from a few years back), so it miiiight be worth signing up for O365 to keep desktop apps updated, too? I've been a RingCentral customer and would prefer to probably not use them again (too big and heavy for our needs). I just signed up for [voip.ms](http://voip.ms) to play around with it, but I know very little about SIP and making all that work - I think I can do it, I've just never done it before.\n\n\n\nAny help would be really appreciated. At this very moment, I'm very loosely leaning towards O365 & Teams Phone purely for the desktop apps and maybe onedrive, but I just don't know. Maybe Google. I'm driving myself in circles.

I\u2019ve been doing this now for a little over 12 years and I actually really love it. I\u2019m lucky enough that I get to choose my own destiny and control most of how and where I travel (but not always). A few things that I do to help keep it interesting - YMMV.   \n  \n\u2022 Early flights only where possible. No red eyes and then straight to a meeting in the morning, If international, fly in a day earlier even if you have to pay for it yourself. These flights tend to have the most well behaved passengers and the first flights in the morning usually get priority and won't have backups.   \n  \n\u2022 Going to somewhere cool? (Tokyo, Stockholm, Melbourne, etc...) - get there 2 days early and make time for yourself. See the city. Take public transport. Buy local. \n\n\u2022\u00a0Subscribe to Monocle magazine. It's not only chock full of great content but will tell you where to shop for cool stuff and takes forever to read. It's a nice change from the usual nonsense on the plane if you want to spare some time working on that deck. \n\n\u2022\u00a0Find and buy one really cool thing from each city you go to. At the end of the year, you should have a collection of cool shit where each piece tells a story.   \n  \n\u2022 Never fly in for a meeting and then head directly to the airport to fly back right after.    \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Choose 2-3 airlines, stick with them as much as you can.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Collect points and rewards on everything on your personal account - NOT CORPORATE. No sharing with your team or account. Sometimes you can sneak this, sometimes you can't.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Let client pay for your economy class flight - you pay for upgrades. Never fly economy and always get the rewards. Economy is for the common people. You are not a common person.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Non-stop flights only. Multi-route stops to save money is the devil. Alternatively, know when it makes sense to fly into a nearby airport and then rent a car and drive to your destination. If you have time, it can make it a lot more fun and you can take meetings/calls in the car (eg: Going to Reno? Fly into SFO and drive through Tahoe and Carson City)  \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Rent from Sixt where you can. They have great customer service and excellent cars. I would also suggest trying out European brands in the EU if you can - way more fun to grab a Renault, Skoda or Citroen than a Ford.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0One hotel chain (mine is Marriott) and try to stay in the same hotels as much as you can. Get to know the staff. Your goal is to know the names of the receptionists and servers and have them know you well enough to ask about your kids/significant others or pets. You'll not only get perks but you'll be able to time your arrival from the airport/train much easier than if you've never done it before.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Have a routine. I have routines down to the second at JFK, AUS, LAX, SEA, SFO and MDW. I know the gates, how long it will take to get through TSA and where to eat to ensure I get to the gate as early as I can.   \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Know when to break the routine. If you\u2019re going to a common client site, try to explore a new breakfast place each morning before you head over. Hotel breakfasts are boring.   \n  \n\u2022 Get good luggage (Rimowa is trendy but sturdy - worth the $$$) and put something unique on it. I have Alien stickers from the Nostromo on it. You\u2019ll never miss your bag  \n  \n\u2022\u00a0Airtags in the luggage. Always. \n\nFinally, check YouTube and see if you can find a walking video in a district or neighborhood you\u2019ll be it. Study it and then make notes of cool places to check out once you\u2019re actually there. It will save you time and keep from getting lost. \n\nBon voyage!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1719269387, "created_utc": 1719269387, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "la4emwf", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1dnlvut", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_la4emwf", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1dnlvut", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1dnlvut/is_anyone_here_who_mostly_travels_for_their_job/la4emwf/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1719269404, "saved": false, "score": 10, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 10, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "receptionist not worth", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-06-24"}

Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.\n2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.\n3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.\n4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.\n\n> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.\n\nPart of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.\n\n> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.\n\n> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?\n\nYes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). \n\nNow - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.\n\nCAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.\n\nThat sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. \n\n> When did you decide to add an associate?\n\nWhen we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).\n\n> Do you build a big cash cushion first?\n\nYes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.\n\n> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....\n\nAgreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps a bit thankless, work. Check out appellate public defense work. I might be doing that if I wasn't doing this and had no loans. Last contract I saw here was 165k for full time doing nothing but writing and arguing appeals.\n\nThe admin is probably more important than the paralegal, to be honest. Without enough work on hand, a paralegal is just attorney billable oppotunity cost. An admin who can do some paralegal stuff is better for scaling than a paralegal who can do some admin stuff.\n\nWe used MyCase for our management system; we haven't had any issues with it, and they keep adding features I ask for, so...\n\n> what % of revenues would you allocate to sales and marketing as you scale up?\n\nThis figure is highly dependent on how savvy your competitors are with their own marketing. For us, in our market, it's about 2.5% of gross. \n\nBut what really matters is your actual customer acquisition cost. That is the relative metric that you need to investigate. The reason I say this is that it's almost impossible for a law firm to have a customer acquisition cost that exceeds the value of the customer, i.e the case. \n\nFor example, if I get a single family law client, I know that case is worth at least $5,000 or $6,000 in billable time, and more like $15-20k if it is one that goes to trial. As long as these type of cases exist in your market, you are safe to collect more of them by spending more marketing dollars, so long as you are not spending more in marketing in one month than billable work that you can do. \n\nDistilling the above, don't advertise so much you take on so many cases that you can't bill enough to pay for your ads. Hand in hand with this, make sure that you delegate consults so that you as the managing attorney are not on a merry-go-round of bringing money in, but never generating revenue yourself. \n\nMy advice in this area is to use search campaigns like Google ads. You want your ads displayed in places where people who are looking for attorneys are going to be. That means that most display campaigns, including billboards or video ads or on the back of the menu at some restaurant are not going to do much other than get your name out there. Very high quality search campaigns that deliver in the snippet results exactly what the person is looking for are the way to get conversions. Remember, you don't have a widget that you have to convince your customer they need. Your customer is already looking for you. Your marketing needs to tell the customer why you are the best option of the places they're already looking at.\n\n> How can I implement AI and automate systems to keep costs down?\n\nDo not do this. Maybe spring for CoCounsel. AI right now is at best like a photographic memory idiot savant intern with crippling ADHD. We use CoCounsel because it is very good at it's applied LLM tasks and integration to Precision, but again - *only* that closed-book scenario. Not generative.\n\n> For example, does your firm's website ask for all intake info so the assistant doesn't need to gather it?\n\nNo, but you can totally do this via a platform like MyCase. We found that the best way is a contact form for name, email, phone, message. Then call the lead or direct email in response to the web submission. \n\n> Can I hire an assistant in India?\n\nDo not do this. Your growth model is first 1A and 0S. Then 1A+1S. Then either 1A + 2S or a hop directly to 2A+2S. Then I would recommend from there growing at a rate of N attorneys + 2 staff. Revise around a size of like 6-7 Attorneys and 8-9 Staff. \n\nSide note - the most relaxed legal job I've held was as a clerk in school at a firm that had a staffing of, I shit you not: a paralegal, legal assistant, AND case manager for EACH of the 3 attorneys; plus another 4 full-time staff (reception, bus. manager, and 2 records maintainers); and then a part-time accountant and two part-time nurses.

But nothing felt FULFILLING.

They charge high monthly fees, the sites look dated, and the worst part is they \u201cown\u201d everything \u2014 so if you ever want to leave, you\u2019re stuck.\n\nFor a firm your size, I\u2019d recommend building on **WordPress**. It\u2019s user-friendly, easy to update, and if it\u2019s set up the right way from the start, it gives you a solid foundation for growth. That way, even if you\u2019re not super techy, you or the attorneys can still edit pages, post updates, or add bios without needing a middleman.\n\nThe key is investing in a **professional setup**. You can absolutely find someone on Fiverr for cheap, but you\u2019ll usually end up with a clunky site that doesn\u2019t perform. A properly built WordPress site can look clean, run fast, and last you years \u2014 while also being built to support SEO, PPC, and even Local Service Ads if you decide to run those later.\n\nI specialize in working with firms in similar spots and the biggest difference is building the site not just to \u201clook decent,\u201d but to actually **support lead generation**. Even if most of your business is referral-based, having a site that shows up when someone Googles your firm name or \u201ccriminal defense near \\[city\\]\u201d or \"attorney \\[attorney+name\\]\" makes a huge difference.\n\nSo my advice: skip Martindale, set up on WordPress, get it built right once, and then you\u2019ll have something that\u2019s professional, easy to manage, and not tied to a crazy monthly fee.\n\nI'd be happy to answer any more questions: [https://tylerperez.com/](https://tylerperez.com/)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1758056969, "created_utc": 1758056969, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nelfevo", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1di19hl", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nelfevo", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1di19hl", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1di19hl/website_for_fiveattorney_practice/nelfevo/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1758056989, "saved": false, "score": 0, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 0, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "worst answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general"], "_date": "2025-09-16"}

I\u2019m definitely not there yet, but I have a fledgling solo criminal defense practice that is attracting clients with difficult charges who are willing to pay more than the average rate in my area. I certainly don\u2019t have all the answers, and I have a long way to go, but I\u2019ve been building towards what you are talking about.\n\n  \nNo one cares where you went to law school. I went to what many consider the worst law school in the country. I have been asked where I went to law school by a client 1 time in 7 years of practice. And he was actually a business law client.\n\n  \nWork somewhere out of law school where you can work with excellent attorneys and do a shit ton of cases and take them to trial when it\u2019s appropriate. Look to those excellent attorneys for mentorship. Today I\u2019m working on voir dire questions for a case that two mentors of mine are trying next week. I\u2019m not getting paid, I\u2019m just doing it for the love of the game. They asked me for help because I kicked 8 jurors for cause in a felony DUI trial last week leading to me winning a case I had no right to (technically, one charge hung 9NG-3G). The way I did that was by using a method I learned from another exceptionally talented attorney I go to for advice.\n\n  \nI\u2019ll help other attorneys with trials for free. Sometimes I\u2019ll just spectate on trials. \n\n  \nHave excellent customer service. I loved House MD as a kid, but in real life House wouldn\u2019t be a great doctor despite his technical brilliance. Bedside manner is fucking huge in any service industry. There are occasions where my client gets the same result they would have gotten with a PD or even pro se. A lot of what clients pay you for is for peace of mind. They want to know they are getting the best possible outcome. Never underestimate the value of just being emotional support.\n\n  \nMake sure people hear about that customer service. I worked for my last firm for 13 months. In that time, I got well over 100 google reviews for his firm that mentioned me. Now when a person is looking at his site, they hear about how highly people think of me. Can\u2019t say any of them have been famous, but I have gotten a few calls in the last two months (how long I\u2019ve been solo) to the effect of \u201cI\u2019ve got \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ charges and I hear you\u2019re the guy/the best/awesome\u201d. Usually they read that on a review somewhere, or a friend told them. I\u2019ve gotten a Google review was from a juror who was impressed by me. I handed out 5 business cards to the jurors in my last trial last week.\n\n\n\nI will talk to strangers in the courthouse about their case.

I'm Alex, the Social Media & Community Manager at iManage. Thank you for raising the questions. I've taken the thread back to the iManage Product Team, and we have prepared the response below.\n\n\\-\n\nThanks for the discussion here. We appreciate the thoughtful feedback, and we'd like to address some important misconceptions directly.  \n  \n**RE: Semantic search vs. keyword search**  \nSeveral commenters raised a core tension: lawyers want *exact* matches, not fuzzy semantic approximations. As someone mentioned: \"If I'm searching iManage for a document or specific phrase, that's what I want - exactly.\"\n\n  \n**We hear you, and we agree**  \nAsk iManage is not replacing keyword search or forcing semantic matching on users who don't want it. Traditional search isn't going anywhere. We've built a different tool to solve a different problem: answering questions that might span multiple documents when you *don't* already know exactly what you're looking for.\n\n  \nWhen you know the document name or a precise phrase - use search. When you need to synthesize information across matters, find patterns in past work, or answer questions like, \"What termination provisions have we used in vendor agreements?\" - that's what Ask iManage is for.\n\n  \nTo clarify how it works: **it's agentic retrieval over the Work API, not full RAG with embeddings over your entire DMS.** The system iterates through multiple search strategies using Work's existing filters, security, and ranking to narrow down to a high-confidence set of documents. Any semantic analysis happens *post-retrieval* on that smaller candidate set, not by maintaining vector embeddings for millions of documents. This approach ensures the DMS security model stays intact.  \n  \n**RE: Timing and pace of innovation**  \nOne commenter asked why this wasn't introduced \"\\~2 years ago when RAG was all the craze.\" Transparently, it's because we wanted to get it right for professional services environments, and not ship something that could frustrate more than help.

Congrats on the opportunity. You're going to crush it.\n\nOne very helpful mantra I have learned ([from DHH of Basecamp](https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71)) I tell myself all the time is: **when you plan a project, you are doing so with the absolute worst understanding of the problem.**\n\nWhen I first started my agency (one year ago, still very new to the game), I was completely paralyzed when it came to writing my first proposals. I told myself: *\"how am I supposed to confidently present a plan for something...when I've never done that thing? They'll know I'm full of shit...or I'll estimate everything all wrong and will look like a fool.\"* So my advice is keep your proposal as simple as possible, focus on the things you do know to be true versus what is variable, and know that projects will always evolve over their course. Priorities shift, clients want changes, what you launch doesn't work perfectly, etc. This is fundamental to the process of making anything, and going in with a positive and adaptable mindset is the most helpful frame.\n\n* **In terms of time,** that's an easy place to start - how much can you realistically devote \\*without\\* impacting other parts of your life that are important to you? **Only you and you alone can set your boundaries.** So if the answer is 2 hours every other day (so Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday), then the answer is 6 hours per week. If you don't draw a clear line in the sand, the people you're working with won't know what is reasonable for you - so they'll ask for more. And not because they're inherently demanding, just because they don't know your boundaries. And without boundaries, you'll come to resent the work - and that's a bad place to be. So ask yourself what *you* *want*.\n* **What you do vs delegate**: again, this is all about your boundaries. It seems like it's important for you \\*not\\* to run socials yourself, so make that clear to your business partner. Offer to work together to find someone who can dot hat work that works within the project's budget. Or, if you want to take ownership of hiring and managing that person, that's your choice - just make sure the price you charge incorporates that cost.\n* **Your hourly rate** is hard to help out with without more information. It depends on your location, your years of experience, the project's budget, what similar consultants in your area/market charge for similar services, and more.\n   * But since this is your first project, I wouldn't get too hung up on price - you can always charge more for the next project. I would consider the floor price the minimum amount that is worth your time. Said another way, it can't be *so low* that when you're mid-way through the project, you're upset that you didn't charge enough. That's another easy path towards resentment and feeling taken advantage of.\n   * Another way to think about it is: if you put a price that's too high in your proposal, your business partner will let you know, and you can negotiate a lower one. But if you come with a low number, they'll just say \"sounds great!\" That's how you know you didn't price high enough!\n\nHope that's helpful.

Maybe they'll forget about it...maybe not. Not a great option. It's best to transparently discuss these kinds of things with your clients.\n\n2. **Take the deal**. \n\nIf you take the deal then there are many side effects to consider.   \na) What's the opportunity cost? Not just financially from other deals that will no longer materialize, but also in the risk of working for just one client.   \nb) Can you guarantee they will pay you?   \nc) Can you guarantee that they'll continue to use your services?  For how long and at what levels?  \nd) Can you gain exclusivity with them too? In other words, if you can't work for anyone else, will they commit to not hiring anyone else for their YT/socials? This is a real threat because it's 100% possible and even likely that they could dilute what they give you over time.    \ne) Can you get a higher rate or more services (e.g., not just YT, but what about other platforms too like IG) that with your existing arrangement?  \nf) What are the contract terms? How long are they locking in for? I'd make it at least two years.\n\n3) **Reject the deal**. \n\nThe big con with their proposal is that they'll be taking 100% of your agency's resources, bandwidth, and future opportunities. If you take a deal, you're effectively not an agency anymore...you're a contract vehicle to provide individual talent to a single client...a staff augmentation contractor. You wouldn't have much of a future, if any, as an agency. There's nothing wrong with that and you can can probably make some dough with the arrangement, but it's a completely different business model. If you're considering rejecting the deal, first review possible alternatives that could make the arrangement more to your liking and reduce the client concentration risk. Push hard to make it the right deal for you, because worst case, the deal and relationship fall apart and you're back to being an agency. What's really the worst case to rejecting the deal? You go get more work elsewhere, and there's plenty of that to go around. \n\n4) **Proposal an alternative arrangement**. \n\nCounteroffers could be:  \na) Tweaking any proposed terms or items listed in the rest of this answer.  \nb) Insist on the ability to take on other work. It'd be in your best interest to have as few restrictions as possible.   \nc) Make sure you get paid and handsomely.    \nd) They buy you out. They'll going to be taking 100% of your agency bandwidth, and why not just acquire you? \n\nI hope this helps you think through your options. \n\n\\~ Erik", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1721053753, "created_utc": 1721053753, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ldamug6", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1e3vgaq", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_ldamug6", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1e3vgaq", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1e3vgaq/a_big_news_company_wants_my_help_but_said_i/ldamug6/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1721053768, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "worst answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-07-15"}

A lot of this won't apply to me, but I'll raise objections to these anyway.   \n\n\n>If they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Look at the worst ones and see how the agency responds. If they did not respond, ask them to explain what happened.  \nIF they don't have reviews anywhere, ask them why not. Be suspicious\n\nI don't have any reviews. Doesn't mean I'm bad. I've worked in Meta and several other big tech brands as well as running ads for my own startup.\n\nNot having reviews or not means very little. Most business owners/marketing teams are too busy to leave reviews. Then you have agencies like KlientBoost, who I know for a fact, who pays for reviews.   \n\n\n>Look at how they do their own advertised services for themselves. If they are a web developer, how is their website? If they run ads, find their ads on Facebook Ad Library or Google Searches by searching the agency names. Do they come up? What's the quality like?\n\nI don't know if ads are any good just by looking at them, so I'm not sure how you would gain any insight from that. We don't know how they're doing their retargeting, how those ads are delivered, which part of the funnel they're being delivered to, etc... \n\nWe can make assumptions based on copy and design with what little information we have, but I would say making assumptions isn't very effective in the majority of situations--especially with little context. \n\nIn fact, it's well-known that B2B champions and decision makers start the procurement process through social by speaking to their peers--dark social. So depending on the target deal size and service complexity, it might be beneficial to not run ads at all and instead focus on content.   \n\n\n>Look at their previous work and case studies on their website. Do they have them? Check out the companies they mentioned. Look at how that company is doing the services the agency claims to provide. Is it well done?\n\nCase studies are low-hanging fruit with dramatic results. They aren't peer-reviewed. Not an effective way to demonstrate expertise nor judge it. There is an exception here--progress over time. It's also best if they can provide rationale. Multiple wins over an extended period of time which shows that they deliver beyond low-hanging fruits and can do more than push buttons.   \n\n\n>Look to see if the agency is organized and follows structured methods. Ask to see their SOPs, also known as standard operations procedures, to see if they have one. Do they have a clear system for getting started and taking you through the processes? How do they manage their client relationship? How do they know that they are failing you?\n\nI don't have anything to argue here. This is clearly necessary. But how really just how detailed are those SOPs? Also is there an emphasis on strategic thinking? Because I worked at a large international agency, and that's what people lacked most.   \n\n\n>Ask them to run you through how they would get started. Pay attention to how much and what kind of information they gather. Do they delve deep into your needs, your clients, personas, etc. Or do they ask generic questions and fail to dig deeper?\n\nThis is also good. No argument here.   \n\n\nUltimately, the 1 fail-safe way to hire an agency or freelancer: \"How do you test? And let me see your system and processes for testing.\"\n\nBig agencies might have an experimentation program, but they aren't very methodical about it nor do they make it a priority. This means no one is actually pushing the envelope of what can be achieved. Also, are they running experiments that Google/other platforms want them to run so they can get awards or are they truly attempting to innovate?\n\nAlways be testing isn't the right answer either. You can't test just to test. Good testing gives direction. It's a process of elimination that pushes the marketer and agency forward to new discoveries by uncovering the underlying rules and principles that dictate performance. \n\nTesting is what creates predictable revenue over an extended period of time. \n\nAnyone who is methodical about their experiment process can beat a specialist who doesn't run track and run tests. The specialist might outperform them at the beginning, but over an extended period of time, the person who runs a methodical experimentation program will always beat them.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1704300427, "created_utc": 1704300427, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1704300723, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kg59vee", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_18xmoqg", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kg59vee", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_18xmoqg", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/18xmoqg/how_would_you_choose_an_agency_lets_create_a/kg59vee/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1704300445, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "worst answering service", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-01-03"}

(how close is the 'usual' to best / worst?)\n\n**Case team**: who's on the team? What are their levels and backgrounds? Where do you like to hire from (firms, universities, backgrounds)?

Structuring a financial transaction to obscure its purpose is also a problem for accounting professionals, as no doubt you are aware.\n\nBest of luck to you in your business. \n\nRegards, /u/theChezBiippy", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1676050992, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "j807hc8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_10yxnz2", "locked": false, "name": "t1_j807hc8", "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_10yxnz2", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/10yxnz2/nonattorneys_asking_for_referral_fees_ending_a/j807hc8/", "retrieved_on": 1678236263, "score": 114, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 114, "_search_query": "answering service disappointed", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general"], "_date": "2023-02-10"}

Our call histories are completely different, even after waiting a day and signing out and in we can never get anything to match. Better yet, you can't even seem to delete a simple text message from the application when you want to, instead receiving an error message that it's unable to be deleted. \n\nThe voicemail is a huge disappointment. There's no voicemail box that can be accessed from both phones via the app. Instead one user gets the voicemail and the other gets an email with the voicemail attached. I could live with that except the voicemail is attached in .wav format which is not supported by any extension in existence on google chrome so every voicemail needs to be downloaded to just listen to it. \n\nText messaging (we have our 10 DLC registration) seems to decide on whether it will work or not day by day. Sometimes messages send, sometimes they don't, but they always show they sent on my end just adding to the confusion and irritation. I end up often having to give customers my personal number so that we can effectively communicate. The entire reason I have a VoIP is to just use one number and now we have customers that have three numbers, exactly what I wanted to absolutely avoid! \n\nDon't even get me started on the Bluetooth connectivity with vehicles, it's bizarre. If I had been on a call at and get into my vehicle at a later time, long after the call has ended my vehicle Bluetooth thinks there is a phone call in process. But there is no phone call and the only way to get my phone to connect correctly is to completely restart my phone, closing the Nextiva app doesn't have an affect at all.\n\nWorst yet is the scenario when I try to answer a call while connected to Bluetooth. When I pick up, the music lowers volume but does not stop or turn off completely. It continues to play via the car speakers but sounds as if it is playing through the phone speakers (poor audio quality) at the same time the callers voice comes through the speakers as the music continues to play but at a very low volume (even when volume is all the way up). I have no idea if the caller can hear the music on their side but its impossible for me to hear them anyways so I have to be sure to turn off Bluetooth before taking a Nextiva call. When taking a phone call on my actual phone, none of these issues exist. \n\nThis has happened on both my Galaxy S20 Ultra and my new Galaxy S22 Ultra (just upgraded a couple weeks ago) so it's not a phone issue. Making things EVEN worst is the fact that I have \"Number Garage\" another VoIP service on my phone for another business that I do not own but manage. That VoIP and application that costs a FRACTION of what Nextiva costs seems to work flawlessly with little to no issues in comparison. \n\nNow I am unsure on what direction to go in, I've been researching other VoIPs but hesitant to make any decision because I am paranoid that I will get \"trapped\" into another dumb situation. Obviously every VoIP is going to have at least some isolated issues but at this point I'm feeling a bit beaten down and second guess any direction I lean in. However, I just cannot continue to stick with Nextiva as I feel it is having a negative effect on not only my business and productivity but my overall stress level.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1743347332, "created_utc": 1743347332, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "mkj0umb", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1jn8ndd", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_mkj0umb", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_mkj0sl6", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1jn8ndd/how_to_find_a_voip_that_actually_works_for_us_and/mkj0umb/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1743347353, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service disappointed", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-03-30"}

Being freelance myself for 6+ years, 2 of them running my own agency I can give you these tips from the bottom of my heart:\n\n1 - don't chase status, which you are by asking a the question \"what\" agency you should start. I'm not accusing you, but it comes off as you wanting to get \"the answer\" of what service to start. Now image your car breaks down and you call a mechanic. But this mechanic is doing this only for two weeks and don't get your car running, just because someone told him being a mechanic is \"the best way to be self-employed\". \n\nNow, the point I'm trying to make here is that running an agency sounds cool, but is it? Rather than focusing on the status, focus on yourself and your skills. Nowadays you can make money with everything, literally. What skills do you have or have the interest to learn? What \"problem\" do you want to solve or what kinda people do you want to have an impact on? Don't wanna work with people? Maybe a service based model isn't for you, maybe it is, only you could know. \n\nGo step by step, it's like a game. Don't ask what Porsche you should buy if you haven't earned your first $1 yet. Don't ask about the agency, ask about your skills, your interests and what you could do all day without even getting paid. \n\n2 - plan maximum only 12 weeks, not 10 years. You have no clue what's waiting for you on the other side. It always never plays out the way your think / plan and that's okay, it's called live. Ride the wave, enjoy every minute of it and focus on your craft. \n\n3 - talk to a lot of people. Be interested in different business models, entrepreneurs, \"agency owners\" (not Iman Ghadzi videos) and ask about their service, experiences and upcoming. The phase you're in is the very very first step, act like it. You don't need to make 100k, you don't need automations or fancy systems / software / coaching. Stay away from shiny objects and try being okay with you having no clue what you're doing. Don't put a time on it, it's about the lifestyle with all the goods (status, money, accomplishments) and the bad (confusion, clueless, loneliness, disappointment etc.) \n\nYou're gonna find your thing, wish you all the best :-)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1720545284, "created_utc": 1720545284, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lcdnfek", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1dykz70", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lcdnfek", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1dykz70", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1dykz70/agency/lcdnfek/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1720545297, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service disappointed", "_search_bucket": "churn_general", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_not_ready"], "_date": "2024-07-09"}

Also former tech analyst, been following tech and AI for 25+ years.\n\nHere's the fundamental problem with \"AI\" as we know it today. In the efforts to build a system that is \"predictive/generative\" (e.g. capable of guessing or \"creating\"), tech has somewhat intentionally moved to a model where probability is more important than accuracy. \n\nLet's look at something as basic as spell checking. It used to be that you'd choose a \"dictionary\" for spell checking in word processors like Microsoft Word. This meant that if you were (for example) in the legal profession, you could install a legal dictionary that had specific phrases (e.g. Latin) and spellings that conformed to your specific needs. If you were in a doctor's office, you could put in a medical dictionary instead. This reduced both spelling errors and the \"false positives\" you get when spelling something correctly according to YOU but not what the \"spell checker\" thought was incorrect.\n\nThat went away.\n\nThen instead of flagging the error, we had \"auto-correct\" everywhere. So now, the computer simply assumes that when I type something, that it knows **better** than me, so it changes it. My favorite current example of this is how on the Mac, when you type b) (as in... a) b) c) it will auto-correct it to the sunglasses smiley emoji. It will do this even when I click the little X to say \"don't do that\", meaning I have to CMD-Z then right arrow to get away from the highlight, all to get... exactly what I typed.\n\nNow, we have \"predictive text\" where increasingly, products assume they can predict what I want to say. Usually, it's not too bad, but occasionally, it results in errors in *meaning* that I have to correct. Not at all what I want.\n\nSo let's look at the particular problem of redacting medical records. Keep in mind that AI is designed to **approximate** thoroughness not actually achieve it. What's weird is that if you took a \"non-AI\" approach to redacting (for example) SSNs, it should be pretty easy:\n\n>Flag any string of nine digits, including if they are separated by dashes or spaces. If the string starts with a 9, 000, or 666, flag it separately.\n\nThat is an \"old school\" (computing-wise) way of stringing absolute yes/no queries together to form a near foolproof search. \n\n**But that's not how tech is doing searches anymore.**\n\nSo, when I open a PDF in Acrobat, I'm literally bombarded with efforts to get me to use \"AI\" when all I want to do is easily search for and redact information, then properly Bates number and produce. \n\nTo be honest, it's not the process of manually redacting that is \"killing\" me as a paralegal; it is the constant and unwanted changes to functionality and interface that big tech companies (looking mostly at you Adobe and Microsoft, but Apple and Google suck nearly as much) insist on making to critical software. \n\nI'm sure I'll be criticized as \"biased\" since as a \"paralegal,\" my job is \"threatened by AI,\" but... I'm not worried at all. My SAs trust me to prepare materials for production because I'm meticulous and efficient, something AI is neither. \n\nJust for fun, on an internal meeting, I used the \"AI summary\" feature of our RingCentral phone system. The transcript of the call was pretty good, but the \"summary\" was so directionally wrong in many critical places that we flat-out abandoned it for note taking. I can type *almost* fast enough to do verbatim-ish transcripts of calls, so if my SA wants to be free to focus on the call while I take notes, that works so much better than any solution we've found. Plus, they get the benefit of their paralegal actually *understanding* the matter instead of relying on an AI summary, so I'm even more efficient going forward.\n\nYou specifically mentioned the \"initial detection pass,\" and this is where (as someone who considers myself competent as a paralegal), I think you're looking the wrong direction for tech assistance. Whenever I have a \"simple but must catch every instance\" task, I rely FIRST on my own initial pass, THEN on a second pass, then THIRD on a \"tech-facilitated\" sanity check. For example, I recently had to draft a complaint where a lot of the material was coming from a previous petition, and \"Petitioner\" needed to be changed to \"Plaintiff\" (along with all the possessive and plural variations) and \"Respondent\" to \"Defendant.\" I did the first pass while I was cutting and pasting and writing, the second pass while I was formatting and editing, then did a simple \"Find\" command for the original terms. \n\nCurious what others who do the work think, but IMHO AI isn't capable of avoiding steps 4 and 5 in your original post. Thorough support staff can help with that, however. :)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1767565543, "created_utc": 1767565543, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nxpignm", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1q40x8l", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nxpignm", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1q40x8l", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1q40x8l/whats_your_workflow_for_redacting_phipii_from/nxpignm/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1767565562, "saved": false, "score": 7, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 7, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "don't trust AI phone", "_search_bucket": "blocker_trust", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_general"], "_date": "2026-01-04"}

Some may be skeptical about their direct lead generation value; however, the *SEO benefits alone can justify the listing*. Here's why:\n\n# \u2705 1. AI & Structured Data Readability\n\nMany legal directories are being scraped by AI and voice search tools like Google's SGE and ChatGPT. Being listed makes your firm more **eligible for inclusion in AI-generated answers** by increasing your digital footprint across trusted platforms.\n\n# \u2705 2. Earn High-Authority Backlinks\n\nMost directories include a dofollow or nofollow link to your website. These **backlinks from trusted, niche-relevant domains** send strong authority signals to search engines. Even nofollow links help diversify your link profile and show relevance within the legal industry.\n\n# \u2705 3. Improve Indexation & Visibility\n\nYour directory profile often ranks in Google for branded and non-branded terms. This **increases your firm's SERP footprint**, giving you more real estate on Page 1 and making it easier for potential clients to find you\u2014even if they\u2019re not searching directly for your site.\n\n# \u2705 4. Boost Local SEO with High-Authority Citations\n\nLegal directories like Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, and Martindale-Hubbell act as structured citations\u2014key elements in local SEO. These listings confirm your firm's name, address, phone number (NAP), and practice areas across the web. Google uses this consistency to verify and trust your business, improving your Google Business Profile rankings.\n\n**Bottom Line:**  \nDirectories aren\u2019t just about leads\u2014they\u2019re about **trust, consistency, and visibility**.

During times that you have extra team bandwidth bc of client churn, focus on establishing clear SOPs in Playbooks that show the workflow and steps, and automate the heck out of them. Build agents that support client & team member onboarding and ongoing support. You'll increase your efficiency, and then be able to focus your team's new bandwidth on the personal touches that strengthen client relationships & trust. All the want-to-dos you've always wished you could do to improve the client experience, but sacrificed for the have-to-dos. Casual check-ins, phone calls, text messages, handwritten thank you cards, celebrations, strategy development, ideation... these things are what we all wish we could expand but deprioritize for the sake of the actual service delivery. It feels like overhead, when in reality these are the things that make the bond with the client sticky. This is just scratching the surface - the ability to activate your team on activities that add value, help with retention/upsell, or even getting them involved earlier in the sales process, so much opportunity.\n\nBack to the fundamentals - for marketing & sales focus on filling up the calendar with conversations, both with potential clients and potential referral partners. Seek out potential referral partner relationships (those who work with your audience in the same or alternative capacity). Establish a referral partner program so you stay top of mind with people who also serve your ideal clients, and so you can easily refer to them as well. Make sure you're able to clearly communicate who you help and the problem you solve so it's easy for everyone to know when someone is a good fit for you.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1745152981, "created_utc": 1745152981, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "mo2z4y6", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1k0msje", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_mo2z4y6", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1k0msje", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1k0msje/running_an_agency_in_a_recession/mo2z4y6/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1745153030, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "don't trust AI phone", "_search_bucket": "blocker_trust", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2025-04-20"}

But you expect people to pay $3.50 a minute for overage on a starter or entry level plan? Or $2.25 on a basic plan? Your pricing of your packages is completely inconsistent. Where did you go to business school? Also where is your HIPAA compliance policy? PCI compliance policy? I would absolutely pay Ruby MORE for peace of mind and not worrying about the inherent liability. Are you receptionists bilingual?\n\nYour site also mentions a dedicated personal receptionist \u201ccoming soon\u201d and suggests we sign up and pay now to get on the waiting list. So it\u2019s like Ruby used to except they did a small team? I\u2019d consider paying your prices if the person(s) were dedicated.\n\nWe pay less now than your rates and have dedicated person(s) and don\u2019t have any compliance concerns. If you offer a demo or trial I\u2019d give you a shot as I have no idea what your backend looks like. I hope the client portal isn\u2019t designed like your Wordpress site. Also hope it\u2019s not an off the shelf solution that will have integration issues. \n\nNot trying to crap on your company\u2026just was pointing out your pricing is grandiose. But I guess it makes sense if you putting yourself in the same league as Ruby, Abby, Smith AI, Nexa etc.. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but are you on that level?

About 10 years ago (around 2015), I attended a small-firm / solo practitioner tech show run by a state bar association (US State). Most case-management vendors there were locally hosted. Only one was cloud-first: Clio. The on-prem vendors spent a surprising amount of time bad-mouthing \u201cthe cloud.\u201d It got borderline absurd. Some were using Google Drive and Google Cloud interchangeably, warning lawyers that Google was mining their data, and citing Gmail ads as \u201cproof.\u201d I personally believed the cloud was inevitable, but at the time I could not convince most small firms that cloud convenience would win out long-term.\n\nFast-forward \\~10 years. Same conference :There is exactly one self-hosted case-management vendor left. They\u2019re still there largely because 90% of their customers are in that state, they still accept paper checks, and they\u2019re running a very healthy lifestyle business (I chatted with the owner).\n\nMeanwhile, Clio is now the legal-tech darling with massive scale and late-stage funding.\n\nSo my takeaway:If you plan to keep this as a niche or lifestyle business, a fully offline / local-only solution absolutely has a market. If you plan to scale, cloud (or at least some hybrid) is almost unavoidable. Security arguments eventually lose to convenience. Not because lawyers stop caring about confidentiality, but because workflow gravity wins. If your product won\u2019t trade some risk for speed and convenience, another one will.  \nThat said, I think your best option is not either/or: Local storage vs Cloud, Private or single-tenant hosted LLMs, Optional offline mode. It might be a combination of both.\n\nA pure desktop, compute-heavy AI product runs into very real friction: Aging laptop,Locked-down IT environments, Firms that can approve case budgets but not hardware upgrades\n\nAt that point you\u2019re selling not just software, but fighting IT policy and capital budgets. So yes, \u201cfully offline\u201d is a real selling point , just not a mass-market one. The trick is deciding whether you want to optimize for control and certainty, or scale and convenience, and designing the product so you don\u2019t paint yourself into a corner. While the cloud only (i.e. public LLM) has a lot of players, you might have a niche with desktop and a different flavor with a private hosted version.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1766521244, "created_utc": 1766521244, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nvlpm90", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1psshtm", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nvlpm90", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1psshtm", "permalink": "/r/legaltech/comments/1psshtm/solo_dev_building_a_local_offline_search_tool/nvlpm90/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1766521261, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "legaltech", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ypxn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/legaltech", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "customers won't accept AI", "_search_bucket": "blocker_trust", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-12-23"}

But it mostly was meeting with clients off the clock. Being social. Building relationships. Finding out what they need / want / want to avoid.\n\nMy point is none of that was 'tracked' either internally by Partners or externally by PE investors who now own a ton of firms.\n\nAlso I cannot make this claim but at least in my experience, most of the Partners when I started early 2000s were 'operators' first and foremost and MBA business types second or not at all. i.e. They came from engineering, industry, etc then started successful firms post 2008. \n\nAnd I saw several MBA slick-backed hair type of Partners come and go. They *never* stuck cause they were only in it to invest a bit then get out for the next opportunity. \n\nNow all of our partner-firms, competitors, etc are ALL run like the latter. Everything is tracked and compared to how it can 'tell a story' to an investor.\n\nWhen I started, I could spend hours coming up with ideas or pursuing roundabout ways to solve client issues. And then try them out by meeting the client face to face\n\nNow that's not allowed because 1 minute you spend doing that is a minute you aren't tracking your billability or 'supporting' an internal 'initiative', which itself has gone through 5 rounds of debates with the financial backoffice or \"strategic growth partner\".\n\nIt used to be that you could try to solve an issue and if it didn't work, then the actual **consulting result** wasn't met, i.e. the deliverable wasn't good or the sale wasn't made. *THOSE* were the results. Either good or bad. If good, you're good. If result wasn't attained, you weren't doing your job and your boss or Partner knows it.\n\nNow, everyone is afraid to try that because it's not just you're trying to develop a client and your Partner or manager saying \"Oh I wanted you to make that sale to that client\" or \"That deliverable needs to be better\" *judged solely based on the sale or deliverable*\n\nNow whether it's good or bad isn't based on the consulting output; it's based on the organizational 'momentum'. As in does your little deck align with the overall organizational goals to make us targets for PE investment? \n\n\"Uh I thought we make this deck or deliverable so the client gets their problem solved? As in what they're paying us to do\" That's not the case anymore.\n\nNow, it's an undefined eye in the sky of KPIs and metrics we all serve, which don't allow for any remediation or improvement. It's just \"Your KPI is 70% and Bob's is 72%. You are worse\". \n\nI think the two above AI and offshoring are both the chicken and the egg, making a perverted cycle.

It's unfortunately not as simple as sending a bunch of demand letters and waiting for the money to come in. \n\n- You can get a settlement offer from an insurance company, but most of the time it'll be too low. It won't cover the medical bills, especially once your fee gets taken out. So the only way to get the offer to go up so it's reasonable (ie an offer the client will accept that'll cover the meds) is to file. Once you're filing, the litigation is a time-consuming waste of time. Most litigated cases get settled without going to trial, but you'll still end up doing discovery on a lot of PI cases. Tons of ATIs. PI litigation is very formulaic, the interrogatories are always the same (describe the accident, client's injuries etc) but managing litigation deadlines in a PI firm with a lot of cases is hard. The law isn't hard, but there's an art to doing PI well and it takes time. \n\n- Support staff is absolutely CRITICAL in PI. The best PI lawyers are the ones that have good support staff. Staff make or break a firm in any field, but esp in PI. A lot of lawyers don't really work on PI cases, it's the staff doing all the work. You don't just need staff that answer phones, you need staff that are super resilient and will stick around despite clients yelling at them 24/7 cuz they want their money immediately.\n\n**Pros of PI:**\n\n- No billables\n\n- Easy to find car crash cases in a major city\n\n- Can make decent money \n\n- Don't have to hound clients to get them to make a payment\n\n- Unless the client was in PT for 6 months+, these cases don't have much paperwork. You're not dealing with 50 exhibits and 2000 pages that often. Most records & bills can be sent/uploaded electronically, which is easier to deal with.\n\n- Don't have to go to trial that often\n\n- Basically zero legal research or motions. If you hated Lexis/Westlaw & case briefing, PI doesn't do any of that\n\n**Cons of PI:**\n\n- **The clients are the WORST.** Aside from family law, PI clients are the most insufferable. They're insanely demanding and will call your office every day demanding updates every hour, and they're completely ungrateful. PI clients think *you* owe *them*, when in reality clients wouldn't get a penny from insurance without us. Clients always think PI cases will get resolved in 1 week, when they actually can take 1-2 years. They think their lawyer will just send a scary letter and insurance will give them $1m. Seriously, PI clients are awful. Pay your staff well, cuz having to deal with some of the worst clients imaginable all day is a really hard job. PI firms can burn through staff quickly cuz the clients are so demanding, and nothing's ever good enough for them. Even when we literally work for free and then give them money. \n\n- **PI's really redundant.** The cases are all really similar, if you're looking for excitement and variety this isn't the field for you. Sometimes you can get a big case with some serious injuries, but those are like 5% of your cases if you're lucky. 99% of PI cases are some guy getting rear-ended/side-swiped at an intersection, then doing 2 months in physical therapy. \n\n- **The satisfaction of helping the injured isn't really there that often.** Tbh, they're usually not injured. Some back pain and that's about it. PI esp in poorer cities can be a bit of a scam where people think a minor fender bender is their ticket to the good life. So you'll get cases with barely a scratch on the car and have to tell them you're not taking the case cuz they're not actually injured. The more exciting cases in PI are the nursing home ones, but those are often depressing wrongful death ones. Nursing homes are really shady and tend to neglect their patients a lot. But yeah, 99% of boring fender benders where your client's probably not really injured. As much as I *despise* insurance companies, there's def truth to a lot of PI cases kinda being a bit of a scam- a lot of physical therapy places are super shady and will have clients do PT more often than needed just to make more money. And chiropractors...total scam. Never send people to chiropractors.\n\n- **You will hear ambulance chaser comments constantly**\n\n- **Multitasking is super important- if you'd prefer to just have 1-2 big cases, PI might not be for you.** PI firms have a bunch of cases going on 24/7, and each of them takes a while to settle. Insurance won't be cooperative, you have to really fight them to actually get the settlement check.\n\n- **A lot of PI cases involve an unknown driver hitting your client.** Finding the unknown driver can be hard, you'll usually have to do a DMV tag search. A lot of clients don't take accident photos, and won't remember the exact location where it happened. That makes things a lot harder. \n\n- **A lot of PI takes longer than it should.** When you get a new PI case, you'll have to set up a claim with insurance- but that can easily take an hour, cuz some make you do it over the phone. Insurance adjusters will never answer your calls, getting in touch with them is hard. You'll have to leave a million voicemails. Insurance companies are evil, they want clients to be mad at you so they drop you- insurance's goal is to drag it out as long as possible so clients fire you and they don't have to pay. Plus ID lawyers have to hit their billables, so they're not interested in settling quickly. Getting records & bills so you can send the demand can easily take 2 months+, hospitals often have 1-2 overloaded staff in the records dept so they'll take ages just to give you the records\n\n- **PI clients are terrible.** I already said that, but I'm saying it again cuz they're a huge PITA to deal with. They'll treat your staff like shit and will threaten to find a new lawyer cuz they're mad it's taking too long. They'll threaten grievances unless you lower your fee...even though they agreed to the fee by signing the retainer & 1/3 is the industry standard every PI lawyer uses. The key is to explain PI cases take a while to settle when the case first comes in- if they understand how the process works at the start, they'll call less often so you'll be more productive. Your goal is to not be dealing with phone calls unless *you* need to talk to them. Interpersonal skills and dealing with clients that are never happy are what truly separates the good PI lawyers from the bad ones.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1729502872, "created_utc": 1729502872, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lszb0df", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1g7xnfw", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lszb0df", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1g7xnfw", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1g7xnfw/whats_it_like_handling_a_typical_pi_case/lszb0df/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1729502888, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "voicemail good enough", "_search_bucket": "blocker_not_ready", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_general"], "_date": "2024-10-21"}

So, I graduated from law school in 2021. Ten days after graduation, my wife passed away. As you can imagine, my post-graduation employment wasn't going to work. I knocked out the bar while handling my wife's affairs and hung out a shingle in my hometown so I could help my in-laws, etc. \n\nSince then, it's been pretty good. I average about $2-4k/week depending on what I'm focusing on. Problem is that I spend about 10-20 hours/week drumming up more work to get into the pipeline. If you're willing to take the odd one-off projects -- such as reviewing a commercial lease for a small business for $500 -- between more complex litigation and business clients, then it's definitely workable.  \n  \nOne note: there are incidental costs that you don't think about at first. Ooma for my office phone costs like $50/month. My domain, email service, and website are about another $100/month. Then there's your portion of the FICA taxes, whether or not you're an S-Corp. You pay for your own insurance. You get the idea.   \n  \nAnd there's always the dreaded accounts receivable issue -- some people don't like to pay their bills. One law firm I did contract work for still owes me $10,000 that I'll have to sue for most likely. That'll be a pain. \n\nFinally, there are emotional costs I didn't expect. It's hard to hear the schizophrenic people leave voicemails; you can hear how much they are suffering with their delusions. People struggling through addiction will cry when you tell them that their criminal charge can't be expunged/sealed. You'll never do enough pro bono work to stem the tide of need out there, but you'll feel like you can and should do more anyway.   \n\nWith that said, I feel like there's a limit on what you can do yourself without working for other attorneys. I've been feeling like an unevenly sharpened knife lately. Because I am in charge of what work I get, I naturally gravitate toward my strengths which leaves my weaknesses to atrophy further. I just finished revising my resume and plan on putting out feelers to see what's out there. My hope is that a stint with a law firm could help me polish myself into something more refined and effective. \n\nI hope this helps. =)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1723826636, "created_utc": 1723826636, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lifiuin", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1esx1fs", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lifiuin", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1esx1fs", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1esx1fs/how_possible_is_a_solo_practice_right_out_of_law/lifiuin/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1723826652, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "voicemail good enough", "_search_bucket": "blocker_not_ready", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-08-16"}

To migrate this to VoIP you either need to use an ATA or use a (generally not cheap) DECT VOIP device like a Gigaset or Yealink DECT device.\n\nVOIP devices have firmware and an end of life and end of support constraint. Depending on how they connect you may run into obsolescence and need to replace them every five years. You have configurations to manage, password to periodically rotate, etc. A PSTN phone just plugs in and works.\n\nYou need to account for infrastructure, what wiring is kn place, is if cat3, cat5, cat5e, cat6, etc. Is this routed to the right place.   Are you upgrading an older hotel and need to connect all those room phones using a 24 or 48 port ATA, or can you replace all those phones and replicate the required functionality by programming those phones.\n\nAre you linking multiple locations together, do you need to centralize calling.\n\nDo you need to enable calling between multiple devices, or call parking, paging, intercom, conferences (3-way, or more), call transfers, voicemail, call recording, etc. Do you have faxes to deal with, alarm systems, older monitoring systems (had a sewage treatment plant that needed a phone line via VOIP once), health alert systems, etc.\n\nWhat's the connectivity throughput and minimum bandwidth guarantees. Do they need encrypted calls? Do they have a good quality router where SIP ALGs can be turned off.\n\nIs it easier to give people just a mobile or an eSIM instead.\n\nThere are so many considerations, constraints, and requirements for both the home or a business. Deciding which is better is not easy to answer.\n\nIdeally you want to do VOIP, it makes things simple in some ways, but harder in others. You need more computer networking understanding for it, whilst a PSTN is trivial.\n\nDebugging call issues with the PSTN is trivial, a volt meter and a landline phone or linesmans handset is enough.\n\nDebugging VOIP calls can involve network packet captures and digging through the SIP and RTP/SRTP traffic. But it could also be an ALG, DNS, STUN/TURN/ICE, network issues, etc\n\nWhat are the requirements, what are you trying to achieve, what are the constraints. Those questions will help you decide.\n\nNote: I've been building VOIP phone systems for nearly 20 years now, with a variety of PSTN integrations.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1755618978, "created_utc": 1755618978, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "n9js8zr", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1mugbd1", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_n9js8zr", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1mugbd1", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1mugbd1/ata_vs_ip_phone/n9js8zr/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1755618994, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "voicemail good enough", "_search_bucket": "blocker_not_ready", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2025-08-19"}

The invitation to serve on a board and receive compensation seemed like an opportunity worth discussing, so I scheduled a call today at 3:00 pm EDT. \n\nThis morning I received 2 separate emails, reminding me of my 1:00 pm phone appointment. So, I concluded that they shifted me from 3 pm to 1 pm. Unprofessional, but ok. \n\nI was prepared to receive their phone call at 1:00 pm, as their email stated. NO CALL!\n\nSo, at 3:30, I noticed that I had a voicemail from this company at 3 pm. The caller referred to his call for our \u201cprearranged\u201d call at 3 pm, as if to suggest that I failed to honor my appointment time. \n\nI called him then, and he apologized for the confusion\u2026He proceeded to run me through the pitch, including the eye opening compensation and limited time required to earn these board fees. \n\nI informed him that I truly possess the credentials that I mentioned, however I was curious how this company is able to do the necessary background check on these candidates. How do they know I\u2019m representing my background honestly? \n\nHis answer was weak, referring to various social media such as LinkedIn and Facebook. \n\nI was waiting for the sales pitch- and sure enough it surfaced. $195 up front, month to month contract.

IMO you need a live receptionist who can answer the phone, receive your mail, and greet clients. You probably also need access to conference rooms. You don't need a physical office; I went full WFH about 5 years in and wish I'd done it sooner. \n\nSecond, start by taking whatever comes in the door. You can get picky about cases once you're established; right now you need to pay the bills. \n\nThird, get paid up front. I understand that's the norm in criminal law, but I spent way too much time chasing civil litigation clients who hadn't paid their bills. Now when the deposit against fees is empty the work stops until it's topped up. Even a client who's paid promptly for years will stiff you when the going gets tough; for whatever reason, the lawyers always get paid last. \n\nFinally, be flexible.

To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).\n\n1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same \u201creceptionist\u201d answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn\u2019t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;\n\n2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal\u2026\u2026\u2026and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I\u2019d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being; which is exactly what I did. I hired a part time (2-3 days a week) woman who is responsible for calling clients, pc\u2019s, talking to the court and scheduling. Absolute life changer (and in hindsight I have no idea how I would have ever been able to deal with a remote paralegal).  I offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I\u2019m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it\u2019s not a lot, but I\u2019m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy. I truly love her and she\u2019s a part of my life now. 10/10\n\n***Extra bonus: she thinks I\u2019m too skinny and brings in donuts. \n\n****Also extra bonus: speaking from one solo to another, having another warm blooded person in the office a couple days a week really makes me feel like a grown up. Lol. It also motivates me (I\u2019m assuming because it adds seriousness to the gig; I\u2019ll talk to my therapist about it and report back though).\n\n3. Hiring my office manager/secretary/paralegal/donut bringer-inner/yeller/line maintainer, made me even MORE busy. So busy it gave me stress; so busy that attorneys loved me for how much biz I was referring them. At this point in this overly long anecdote, I was still using virtual hq to handle calls for the days my office manager, Maria, was not in the office. I really tried to continue to use them, but it just wasn\u2019t feasible anymore. I had too many current clients calling on a daily basis, too many attorneys trying to talk to me, and just generally too much volume for an answering service. Again, Nothing against virtual hq. I ended up hiring a remote stay at home, local, mother who answers my phone m-thurs from 10-whenever. To mirror my sentiment in #2, offered as much hourly as I could afford ($19), told her I\u2019m not meat, I continue to try and bonus her out a couple hundred bucks every month (I know it\u2019s not a lot, but I\u2019m doing my best) and generally try to make her life happy.  Again, I truly love her and she\u2019s a part of my life now. That was a real, unbelievable, game changer because now my clients started realizing that Sally was picking up the phones and Maria was my in office assistant. The \n\n4. When I was a true solo I was operating a law practice; but now, with a 3 day a week office manager and a 4 day a week remote receptionist, I\u2019m TRULY operating a small town general law practice, and I\u2019m really truly proud of it. I\u2019m the public defender in my local municipal courts, I\u2019m a trustee on the local bar, I can\u2019t get outta the grocery store without talking to little old ladies about their wills, I have a color ad in the local paper and write an article in the same every month, I get home to goof around with my wife and kids by 4 ish/5ish every day, I make more $ than necessary.\n\nMore importantly, and trying to stay topical on your inquiry, We (myself, Sally and Maria) really respect and care for each other, each other\u2019s families, and each others well-being. They\u2019ve impacted my practice and helped me make more money and relieve stress (which feels like the name of the game).  ID ADVISE TRYING FIRST WITH AN ANSWERING SERVICE AND THEN EMPLOY A MIX OF REAL AND REMOTE HELP. \n\n\nI apologize for the novel/written therapy, but I have a soft spot for fellow solo\u2019s (and it is happy hour). Love you tons and I\u2019m so happy and proud to hear that a fellow solo general practitioner is killing it. Love you tons!

Being bought in made me a better employee and that partner valued that I was looking out for them and trying to anticipate their needs.

Next on my list is drafting an easement agreement, which I'll send to a different supervising attorney for review before it goes to the client. \n\n\n\nI've been doing this work for a long time, but even less experienced paralegals should not be spending a lot of time answering calls, making copies, and scanning.  It sounds like you want a secretary/legal assistant, or possibly just a receptionist or file clerk.  And if you're constantly asking paralegals to do admin support work, it's not terribly surprising that they've just stopped responding to you.  Although based on your description of the general situation in your organization, I have to wonder, who hired these paralegals, what *is* their actual job description, and how are their duties assigned?  It's unlikely that they truly aren't doing *anything*, so what is it that they *are* doing and why is it invisible to you and other lawyers?  Presumably in a nonprofit you don't have the billable/nonbillable distinctions that generally separate paralegals from LAs, and you may very well not have an abundance of staff so the job descriptions of those you do have may need to be hybrid.  But clearly there's a mismatch of expectations.

For example, in a small firm, a paralegal might do everything from be a receptionist to an office manager to doing actual paralegal work. Larger firms I'm more likely to have dedicated secretaries or receptionists to keep paralegals for billable work. \n\nWhat we found when we looked into the problems we were having was that there were two primary issues: communication and training \n\nAttorneys didn't communicate clearly what work they wanted done or what their expectations were for the work. This led to frustration when the work product was not what the attorneys were asking. \n\nSecond, attorneys did not take time to train the paralegal on the systems and materials that they were asking the paralegals to work on.  This again way too frustration because it was easier for the attorney to do it themselves rather than try to get the paralegal to do it correctly. \n\n\nA really good paralegal is effectively a mind reader.  You can hand them a rough draft piece of work with some vague instructions and they can turn it into a finished document and it distribute it appropriately. \n\nHowever getting a paralegal to the point where they can do that takes a lot of work and training and communication about your particular expectations and what needs to be done. At the beginning it will definitely take longer because you are having to teach someone how to do it rather than simply do it yourself. \n\nWith that said a good paralegal should be able to\n- keep files in order and ensure new items are filed correctly. \n- keep up with notes and summaries enabling an attorney to catch up on a file quickly \n- draft simple documents like cover letters and rote pleadings from forms for your approval.  (You dont need to be a lawyer to write \"the defendant denies the allegations in paragraph 7\" over and over again). \n- calendar deadlines\n- work on service of process \n\n\nIf you are the manager. Think about 5 tasks that you feel like waste your time and keep you from doing productive work.  Write down step by step directions for those tasks and then talk to a paralegal. \n\nIf you are a junior person in a larger entity, talk to partners/managers about what the paralegals do.

However, I would be with the firm much longer than 5 months. If I apply this fall for law school, I would not be going to law school until the following year. This gives me potentially over a year of time, and I\u2019d transition to working full-time after I graduate from undergrad / finish apps in the fall. So there is close to 9 months at least there of full-time work.\n\nThere\u2019s also the chance that I don\u2019t get the score I want / don\u2019t get into the school I want, and I decide to re-apply the following cycle. \n\nGiven this, would an attorney like you consider me for a paralegal assistant role?

I later left that firm and joined a larger firm and continued to do criminal defense and family law. I made most of my money from family law, but enjoyed the criminal law practice 1000% more. For years I tried to ditch family law and do more criminal defense work. I was not successful. Partly because I kept taking on big complex family law cases, but partly because I was known as a family law lawyer and that's what people referred my way. \n\n  \nFamily law burned me out. I was only able to fully quit it by moving to another jurisdiction and joining a firm doing completely different work. \n\n  \nMy family law clients were very needy. They require a lot of staff support. My criminal defense clients were usually not very needy and I barely needed staff to handle them. (Don't get me wrong staff was important, but it was possible to handle my criminal law files without staff if necessary. Family law without staff may be possible for stronger lawyers than I, but I don't recommend it.) \n\n  \nFrom a financial standpoint, your plan makes sense. From a mental health stand point, I strongly recommend against it. If you expand to family law, you will need a good receptionist and a good paralegal. Someone that can calm the clients down when you aren't available, and someone to work up the files for you while you are in court.  \n\n  \nI found that learning family law was not that difficult. That was true in my jurisdiction partly because the judges largely ignored the rules of evidence, rules of civil procedure, caselaw, etc. Family law was where the rules meant nothing. The \"trials\" were not enjoyable like criminal trials. No jury. Usually just the other side, maybe a couple of other small witnesses. Your trial advocacy skills won't get used much. \n\n  \nThe hardest part to learn, beyond dealing with the clients, was calculating child support and alimony/maintenance/spousal support. That and learning how to read a tax return. Befriend a CPA and pay them to help you understand a tax return if that isn't something you are familiar with. \n\n  \nBut ultimately, don't do it.

CYA: I document everything - every call, every action, everything in the case management software. When I need a certificate of conference on a motion to compel I can filter the notes in the file and pull any tagged \"Defense counsel\" and grab the dates to list how many times I conferred with defense on the issue. I can also reference past conversations with clients who might dispute what was said. Possible to do without CMS, but CMS makes it easier. \n\n2. Invoices/document templates. I'm a PI attorney, and I can request medical records in 10 minutes because I generate the request from information stored in the CMS. Same with letters to clients, opposing counsel, motions - all generateable templates with the info already stored from setting up the case. It's little pieces of time that add up to long term efficiency. \n\n3. Automation: Similar to the above, CMS can hook into other software. Client texts the firm? RingCentral saves the text to the case file. Missed call from a client? CMS opens a to do task to call them back with a due date. Case status changes from \"service\" to \"litigation\" - CMS automatically opens to do items to send discovery and initial disclosures. \n\n4. Expansion: You're a new solo, but if you want to bring on staff or other attorneys in the future, having a CMS prevents things like accidentally deleting a line in the excel sheet, usually gives essentially version control to most stuff in the file, and allows you to set standard processes that let you train staff, make sure they're doing their work, assign tasks and grow responsibly. But in order to do that, it's so much easier to set up the processes before you have them and it's just you. build a foundation with an eye towards expansion so you're not trying to create processes and adjust to the new CMS when you've got two paralegals and a receptionist.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1733347228, "created_utc": 1733347228, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m0fn4om", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1h6pc5b", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m0fn4om", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1h6pc5b", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1h6pc5b/do_i_need_case_management_software_as_a_new_solo/m0fn4om/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1733347248, "saved": false, "score": 19, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 19, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "don't need receptionist", "_search_bucket": "blocker_not_ready", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing"], "_date": "2024-12-04"}

We had a full-time receptionist, three full-time paralegals, and one part-time paralegals.  Eventually, we found a receptionist who also served as a legal assistant.

All paralegals were able to keep cases moving and very experienced in their respective areas of law.\n\nMy boss decided to share some of our office space, and he was experienced in securities, and as part of the agreement, he would cover non-dispositive hearings if the boss was not available. I was able to prepare the other attorney for the hearings.  I attended every conference, depo, mediation, and trials, so I knew the cases as well as he did.\n\nThis allowed him to expand whichever area of the practice he wished to grow without having to hire an associate.\n\nBy the time I left, I was able to take on most of the mundane area of firm management, made sure all of his insurance coverage was in place, and dealt with staff issues.

Here is what you need to make this work.\n\n1. Credit. Even if its a cushion - you need to be able to entirely float 2 months expenses at a monment's notice.\n2. Cash. You need immediate cash on hand to make the next 3 payrolls, including your draw.\n3. Work. You need at least 100 billable hours of work per attorney.\n4. Marketing. Solos work by word of mouth; firms market.\n\n> I have hired an assistant but its not enough to scale from trading my time for $$ to being a business owner.\n\nPart of what you are running into here is that scalability requires warm bodies. You cannot ask the same person to be your legal assistant, receptionist, paralegal, and business manager while you spend your time practicing law. Sliding scales.\n\n> Revenue about $320k. Current overhead is $8k/ month (assistant, rent, miscellaneous). Profit is around $220k.\n\nIs that profit inclusive of your draws? There are other numbers that would be more useful as well, particularly what kind of billables you are racking per month and whether you are turning away business.\n\n> I am assuming the next step is to hire a paralegal or associate?\n\nYes.... but you are at a tricky spot. The ideal support staff figure is N+2, but you can swing N+1 in a pinch. You should ideally already have two staff - one admin and one production. That is the key: the difference between administrative and production staff. Admin staff keep things going - answering phones, writing checks, etc. Production staff do legal work like drafting pleadings (i.e. paralegals are also production staff). \n\nNow - if you hire production staff without work to cover a loaded rate of (conservatively) 1.6, you are going to run into cash flow problems that will creep up on you in 6 months. But if you do this, then suddenly your bottom line is going up.\n\nCAVEAT - if you have both admin and production staff (and the key here is non-net-producers), then you need to increase that loaded rate. If you are working an N+2 model with some purely admin staff, I'd shoot for a weighted loaded rate of more like 2 or 2.25.\n\nThat sounds complex, but isn't. For newer associates, it's next to impossible for them to not be profitable in a small firm if they can hit 100 hours per month. \n\n> When did you decide to add an associate?\n\nWhen we hit a point where it had been pretty solid for about 3 months that we were 2 weeks from doing anything and were turing away work that needed done in the next few days (like protection orders and such).\n\n> Do you build a big cash cushion first?\n\nYes; 6m of their salary. Recall they may not be profitable in month 1.\n\n> There is likely to be a recession at some point soon....\n\nAgreed, and slightly worrisome. However, contract public defense is usually a ripe place for steady, if perhaps a bit thankless, work. Check out appellate public defense work.

I\u2019m happy with mycase, but it can\u2019t hurt to see what you\u2019re using. \n\nI think you\u2019re in estate planning. If so, you should reach out to divorce lawyers in the area that you service. Explain to them that once their clients are divorced they\u2019ll need a new estate plan. (obviously you have to focus on the divorce lawyers that service the middle-class and upper class.) offer them a referral fee. I imagine you\u2019ll get a fair amount of work.\n\nI\u2019m curious as to why you need Lexis. I\u2019m not throwing any shade. I mean it\u2019s an honest question. Estate planning law changes slowly. I run a family law firm 82.7% of our time is spent on Paternity, Divorce, and family law post judgment order modification. The rest is spent doing estate planning for our middle and upper class clients post judgment. \n\nI read what used to be called the advanced sheets\u2014 that is the appellate cases and state Supreme Court cases relevant to family law as they come out. They are free and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re free in your state too. On September 1, 2024 my state, California, modified the algebra equation we use to calculate child support. Legal news reported it six months before it happened so no surprises for us.\n\nDepending on how much you\u2019re earning the 350 you\u2019re gonna be paying for Lexus could be significant and might be a cost you can do without\n\nI found that if you focus on a certain area such as estate planning or family law, the amount of new laws very modest and as a result, Alexis or West law subscription is unnecessary  (using fastlaw) to ensure any cases you cite are up-to-date (ie Shepardize the cases).\n\nI\u2019m very interested in your virtual legal assistant. And I\u2019d love it if you had the time too expand on that either on this post or DM. I have four experience, legal assistance and office manager one real receptionist +4 virtual receptionists that we pay for as an expense words I don\u2019t give them 1099s. \n\nI love my virtual receptionists. I\u2019ve made an effort to get to know them and to be interested in them at least superficially and they really do a great job for us. The way we have it set up. Is potential clients go to me or to the office manager. and we can switch that up on the fly. My unique sales proposition is that I have a lot of litigation experience,  so I\u2019m in court three days out of five. But I don\u2019t always have to spend the entire day there. Plus our court takes a lunch break from 12 to 130 during which I spent a portion of my time prepping the parties and witnesses for the second half of the day and a portion of my time returning calls.\n\nI think it\u2019s important that the owner of the firm takes client calls often.

He was suing us because he changed the terms of the lease about two years into attend your lease he did not ask he did not offer: he demanded and proclaimed that they were changing and we had no choice.  \n\nThe attorney I was using at that time was in her third year with a local firm.

It's hard to tell over text, but I feel like the tone you're asking the question in is a frustrated one. High school interns aren't a top priroity for most legal operations and aren't given extreme thought. The truth is that it's not operationally economically to hire high school interns ***most of the time***, so it's hard to get your foot in the door. With that said, if you really do good work then it isn't a massive problem after getting your foot in the door, but you'll still have hardships.\n\nSome of the top things you'll have to overcome, that I also struggle(d) with, are:\n\n* The amount of in-experence that you have in both the legal field and life will greatly affect your experience. Lean into this and don't be over-confident. Ask a lot of questions and be preapred to fix mistakes should they happen. Of course, making 0 mistakes is ideal, but that's not plausible at all. Even the best employees (legal staff, operations staff, and attorneys) make mistakes.\n* The difference between you and co-workers mentally and the way you work. There's a pretty massive difference between generations when it comes to how work is completed.\n* Seemingly being treated differently becausae of your age or education level. This is normal and required an atitidue adjustment on my part to get the most out of my internship. Understand you're not being treated poorly, the things they're trying to teach you are likely just very different from anything you've ever worked with.\n\nI'd also like to clarify that the I began work for the firm I am with now while I was in high school, so I understand your position. In my direct experience, you have to get your foot in the door doing absolute grunt work and then go from there. Through an ICE program, I was the morning receptionist at out main location for about 6 months until they could hire someone full-time. It wasn't until that point that I was given a position I actually enjoyed. \n\nNow a year later, I'm about to start college and the dynamic I have with the firm is beggining to change. It just takes time.\n\n\n\n**Some general advice for starting a career before you have an undergrad degree:**\n\nOnce you have your foot in the door, set yourself apart. I took tons of side-projects while also doing reception work, typically on the bussiness management side, and our managing partner started to lean on me to deal with some of the administrative things he didn't enjoy. \n\nWith resumes, I also recommend you follow the guides listed by top universities. I did tons of unpaid work on political campaigns before this position, which wasn't fun but beefed up my resume and gave me real-world experience. When creating my resume, I based it off the placement office resources at Indiana University, Harvard University, and MIT. Your resume should absolutely be a single page. I'd be happy to send you mine if you do want a reference. Timing is also important. Push your resume to as many firms as you can. Somtimes, delievering them in-person is a nice touch, if it's economical and feasible for you. The attorney that hired me told me that she really appreciated that.\n\nIn general, early career, especially before you have a degree can get very, very, very grindy and fell pointless, but if you find a good set of people, it's very beneifical. The pay also gets better, it just takes time. I'm still not quite at *where* ***I'd*** *want to be*, but I also don't have a degree yet and there are other benefits to my job that I really enjoy that do make up for that. It's important to be able to value yourself from the business' perspective as well. We're a small firm and I understand that I'm a single college kid who makes decent money. I'm admitedly not in a prime position to get a raise and my compensation package is very fair.\n\nWith that, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. There's also some more long-term stuff that I didn't discuss here as it gets to off-topic, but I could really do a mutliple page write up on this topic.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1721106051, "created_utc": 1721106051, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "ldenvgd", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1e4cy7t", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_ldenvgd", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1e4cy7t", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1e4cy7t/why_dont_lawyers_offer_high_school_internships/ldenvgd/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1721106069, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "too small for receptionist", "_search_bucket": "blocker_not_ready", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2024-07-16"}

It depends. You can work up to an easy solo \"Ronin\" type wandering existence, but it takes a while (or some luck) to get to a point where you just take on what you want.  \n\nYou can find a niche and make a living from the shadows. I have friends who are completely virtual and just do \"DSS Defense\" (like a PD for state custody disputes). One guy who is in a rock band but just does family court mediation. One friend is a municipal court judge and runs marathons 50% of the year.  One guy who just helps set up LLCs.  I have one buddy who does simple wills and uses my office to execute them (I send him all the probate cases under $2500).\n\nThe worst part (for me) is the \"running a business\" part.  Keep your overhead low at first and most fees are just profit (minus bar fees, CLEs, malpractice, data access, etc.); MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND SELF EMPLOYMENT TAXES (that killed me my 2nd year!). You could probably get away with a monthly overhead budget of \\~$500.00 (depending on how much you pay for bar dues and insurance). I like having a \"brick and mortar\" spot. I think clients like it better (and I like a human receptionist) . . . but I'm like that \"Gen-X Joke\" where we have all of our digital coupons, but still bring a printed copy.  \n\n\nThe #1 cases for small solos are family court and simple wills; I think you could make a killing suing landlords for security deposits (if your state allows fees to be recovered). SSDI is a decent niche area too. When I hung my own shingle (14 years ago), I advertised $750.00 uncontested divorces. I was happy to get them. Those then turned into personal injury clients and criminal defense referrals. Some of those PI cases keep me afloat all year.  The life cycle of a PI case might be 3 years, so dont bank on that money!)  \n\n\n14 years later I turn away potential clients all week long. But I'm also the type who will go to court with an IV bag straight from the hospital (technically, it was a PTN feeding bag). I'd rather be miserable at work than miserable sitting at home doing nothing.  I actually LIKE helping people and I just focus on helping folks and the money seems to come.  This year, I've grossed more already than in the past 2 years combined, so I'm thinking about just hanging out and remodeling my infrastructure, but some sob story will come through the door and I'll get suckered into another case!

Glad you reached out!\n\nAs I am not in the UK, I can't exactly speak on their terms of employment requirements. Also, I am not in a position to comment on qualifications without knowing your work history or education. I personally took a short administration course through a local college to get a certificate before I got my first reception job in a law firm. This course was just a basic admin course not specified for law, but it was enough to get my foot in the door.\n\nMy first office was a small, slow firm, 4 lawyers, 2 paralegals.   This helped me learn at a slower pace and it truly helped me along the way. I always recommend trying to get into a small firm for those who are wanting to get into a law admin position.\n\nMaybe in your resume and/or cover letter, point out the skills you have that would benefit the role of a receptionist. Can you answer the phone with proper etiquette? Do you have any previous work experience where you had to deal with confidential information or emotionally charged clientele? Can you respond to emails in a timely and professional manner? How organized are you? Do you have customer-service experience? These are all super basic, but majorly important skills to have as a receptionist. \n\nGetting yourself into a position like a law receptionist or admin is a fantastic way to get in and see if this career is right for you without spending the time, money, and effort into going to law school. If you find yourself an opportunity to work in a law firm, really take everything in. Ask questions to better your knowledge. Read through documents during any down time.

Google has to walk a delicate balance with LSA while also keeping law firms who only run PPC ads getting leads. This is often the case when performance drops. LSA is a black box and Google can and does do whatever they want with it. This often means that sometimes performance will be WAYYY up, sometime performace will be way down. Then other times you will suddenly get off topic and out of geo leads. This is when they are testing keyword and geo expansions behind the scenes. The REAL answer to fix LSA is to also be running PPC and run these account in unison to reach your monthly goal. We break LSA accounts out from PPC account in our MCC so that we can see the fluctuations happening in real and make adjustments to budgets between platforms.

They will not, cannot,  help you.  \n\nYou need a test line with one or all of the big 3 that is having the issue.  NVNO do not have the ability to escalate tickets to people who can help.  That is the point of the NVNO, that is why they are cheap.\n\nThreaten your provider with moving to a different carrier. \n\nIf they can't help, then look at the cost to move to a big carrier.  \n\nVerizon business isn't absolutely awful, not fantastic, and customers get lost in the shuffle, and maybe don't get the best support on issues.  \n\nGet a sales quote from a couple providers.  Take that to your provider.  Tell them to fix it or you are going to cancel.\n\nYour provider may do some poor practices, like not validate calling numbers against their customers accounts, thus allowing a customer to outpulse any number they want.  This is a big no no.  They might have a large number of customers with auto dialers.  Could be lots of things.  It could be the big companies are using stir shaken as an excuse to screw over small low cost providers by rating their trust as low and flagging calls as spam.\n\nTrack all the issues you have, emails, and support calls to your provider.  If you are under contract you will need maybe six or so attempts at working with your provider documented to get out of paying ETF for breaking any contracts you are under.  Contracts can always be broken, you just need examples of how the provider is not providing a quality service.  It doesn't matter that caller id is not guaranteed or that service quality is not in the contract.  Any provider giving bad service will let you out of a contract rather than deal with government fines.\n\nIf you really want to keep your provider then file a complaint with your states utility commission.  Every state has one or more departments that take resident complaints about utilities.  And these departments have POWER.  Providers mess with them and suddenly no permits for doing any work on poles, no permits for expansions. \n\nIf you have documented tickets and they want to charge ETF, a report to the FTC will clear that up immediately.  You need good documented tickets.  You need to work with your provider in good faith. If they call you back, answer the calls.  If they want test calls then you make them.

Except these calls also all fail when I just override the outbound caller ID with my [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) DID.\n\nI guess I can bail on [VoIP.ms](http://VoIP.ms) and try another service, though VoIP.ms's hosted IVR is by far the cheapest solution for the very simple need we have (\"If this is an emergency, press 1 to be connected to our after-hours support line\").", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1713820913, "created_utc": 1713820913, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l0sol9t", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1c9s0jw", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l0sol9t", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_l0ne2kq", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1c9s0jw/voipms_call_forwarding_and_preserving_caller_id/l0sol9t/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1713820928, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "tested answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-04-22"}

No response is needed if you happen to stumble upon this post in 2023 or later.\n\n----\n\nI've actually installed asterisk on my work box, edited a dial plan, sent commands to a ATA, etc* so maybe I'm not a total n00b, but I'm at a loss on where to go to get started.\n\nCurrently: I have two prepaid cellphones. One with a number that I've had for 10+ years, so I want to keep it. I cut the copper landline years ago, and probably I can't go back. (Because...) I have FiOS at home (...and I doubt they would want to hook up the copper again). I have several boxes at home and would not be adverse to making up a new box running linux or BSD to run 24/7 as my answering machine/ forwarding box/ etc.\n\nI want to ease in to this because I'm currently job hunting. The truth is that these prepaid phones kinda suck. Sometimes I don't get  my voice mail notification promptly. I do pay less than $12/month for the prepaid plan though. I don't make a lot of calls, but I do need to be accessible.\n\nMy rough plan of action would go something like this:\n\n1. Get VoIP service from a provider and a new local phone number.\n\n2. Build a box to run at home 24/7 to store phone messages, custom dial plans (ex-girlfriend and others), and manage a desktop VoIP phone that plugs in via ethernet (which I have not purchased yet). Probably no analog POTS phones at all unless it is a super cheap option vs getting a digital desk phone off ebay.\n\n3. Forward my new phone number so it rings my two cell phones and my desk phone at work (during certain hours) at the same time, and takes messages if I don't answer (emails me an mp3 of the message, etc..)\n\n4. Port my 10 year cell number over to my VoIP provider once everything is stable and to my liking.\n\n5. (optional) Buy a used Android phone off ebay, flash firmware if needed, and use it without a cell plan for calls over wi-fi to my home asterisk box.\n\nI saw a message a few weeks ago that offered advice for picking a provider, but what I'm really lacking is the VoIP lingo I need to intelligently evaluate what a provider can do for me.  **So (tl;dr) step 1 is probably \"What do I need to look for with a VoIP provider in relationship with what I want to do as outlined above?\"**\n\n*(this was actually done to simulate a user picking up a phone, dialing numbers, etc. It allowed me to write scripts to do automated regression testing on work's souper seekret phone related box. So I'm perhaps not a total n00b but have zero experience with some aspects of routing SIP calls over the net, providers, etc.)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1697922948, "created_utc": 1697922948, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "k5vu7y6", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_pb24j", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_k5vu7y6", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_pb24j", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/pb24j/ive_searched_the_subreddit_for_getting_started/k5vu7y6/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1697922961, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "tested answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-10-21"}

Here\u2019s why AI SEO works so well:\n\n\n\nAI SEO allows marketing teams to analyze large datasets about customer intent, search habits, and preferences. With machine learning algorithms, websites can be optimized for relevant content and keywords that resonate with individual users. This means that search results and on-site experiences are more tailored. Customers can easily find exactly what they need, which speeds up their decision-making.\n\nAdvanced Understanding of User Intent  \n\nTraditional SEO often relies on fixed keyword matching. AI SEO takes it further by mimicking human understanding of queries and context. Natural language processing (NLP) helps search engines grasp nuanced questions, product needs, and pain points. This leads to a smoother and more logical user journey.\n\nReal-Time Adaptation  \n\nAI SEO tools constantly monitor changes in search algorithms and user behavior. They adjust strategies automatically. This can include updating content, optimizing for featured snippets, or enhancing technical SEO without needing manual changes. Customers see fresher, more relevant results, which builds brand trust.\n\nAnswer Engine Optimization (AEO)  \n\nAs customers increasingly use voice assistants, chatbots, and direct answers instead of traditional search results, AI SEO makes sure brands are easy to find in these new answer-first environments. If a consumer asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best wireless earbud for running?\u201d, AI-powered sites that give relevant answers stand out and heavily influence decisions.\n\nPredictive Analysis and Content Recommendation  \n\nAI systems can forecast popular queries, seasonal trends, and changing market needs, ensuring brands stay ahead. They present the right content before customers even know what they want, making purchasing decisions easier.\n\nConversion Optimization  \n\nAI SEO doesn\u2019t just attract traffic; it also focuses on converting visitors. Algorithms test headlines, calls-to-action, landing page designs, and product placements to find what persuades visitors most effectively. This ongoing optimization greatly increases the chances of customer action.\n\nTrust and Credibility  \n\nAI SEO highlights authentic, trustworthy, and highly relevant information.

The second SAAS is an alternative to Mailchimp, Klayvio, etc\u2026 this took 2.5 years and was a $1m yrr business the day we launched it. \n\nThe above is how most agencies progress over the years you find customer, fix problems, niche down to charge people in areas you are most beneficial with your experience and then make software to sell to the general public and stand it up on your agency. I have 6 friends who had 8 figure exits from agencies and this same story would explain 100% of them.

All my best clients have been through referrals. The other typical answer you\u2019ll receive is to target businesses with no website, or outdated website. These can be hard sells, because the owner may not see the value in having a website built or upgraded. So you need to offer and portray additional value, however that may be. Maybe you add a contact form that sends contact form messages right to a CRM (not as difficult as it may sound). Maybe you integrate something from DoorDash into the website. Maybe you build a few different landing pages and do some A/B testing.

Linkedin has a lot of potential customers but its a little hard to find clients there compared to the other social networks. Because everyone tyring to find clients from linkedin, so it makes it compettive.     \n\n\nHere's the steps exactly  you have to follow:    \n\n\n1. Find some groups on facebook. If there's no exact groups that you're offering service for no worries, just imagine whats othe related groups that your ideal clients can hangout. Maybe gohighlevel group, because thats an agency group. Think like that.   Go connect only only with the profiles that matches your clients persona  \n\n2. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing energy in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your energy on it.   \nrandom prolfiles arent the solution specially when you're struggling.  So, it should be specific and direct.   \n\n3. Don't send spam (DMs, cold outreach etc).  Dont chase attracts them.  Chasing clients is losing enery in my opinion, well if you have VA for that then its ok. But dont waste your enery on it.   \n\n4. Now lets tak about the content. Its very important.Always save energy to put on somehting that works.  Now its AI generation, so use it.  Ask AI to create some topics that can trigger your ideal clients or attract them. Then the AI (Bard or GPT) will give you a bunch of catchy lines that you can use as headline. It really can attract because AI know the human psychology it has a lot of data. Then choose the best topics and craft your content.  Try to make them shorted instead of bigger version. But dont create too many contents,  try to create minimum and engage them first.   \n\n5. Engagements:   Comment on other people posts, and groups.  Its more imprtant than your post. You can create one post weekly, but you should comment every day, even as many as you can.  For facebook groups,  find the best engaging posts and for linkedin find the thought leaders in your industry. Then go comment on thheir post. Any comment you add should be trigger people, so they reply you. start conversation, and this is how you get attention and over the time you you will potential clients.   \n\n\nI think its enough for today to explain what I do to get most of my clients though.

You mentioned a few points that I also want to add to having opened my own digital agency as apposed to SMMA. \n\n- The problem with just being a middle man is the inability to scale, problem solve and troubleshoot. You\u2019re basically selling \u201cshallow\u201d service of posting on social rather than marking a brand on social media. There is way more marketing making then just being present on socials. It\u2019s about shaping consumer behavior and analyzing performance to keep clients. There are tactics and strategies at play and trusting freelancers to keep your agency afloat is not the best move since they won\u2019t care about your clients it company as much as you. What if they leave you high and dry. Not to mention client facing meeting where you might cover reporting and explains performance and next steps etc. You\u2019ll need to have knowledge about the service you are offering. You\u2019re still in high school take the time to intern for example and gain experience first before offering a service to companies via a freelancer. \n\n- Even if you feel like you don\u2019t need to differentiate yourself\u2026 you definitely need to. Prospects usually shop around before they sign any contracts. They probably talk to 10 other agencies before deciding and if you\u2019re not making a great impression and impressing them with you knowledge and what you can do for them then you can\u2019t get clients and eventually scale and be able to charge more. And if they have questions that you can\u2019t answer because if your lack of knowledge then you can\u2019t build trust. \n\n- YouTube is a great way to learn strategies but again you won\u2019t know if they work unless you test them and adjust to what works for you. Take everything with a grain of salt. A better option is to get certification from meta or other platforms that other them. This also build credibility with clients and peers. \n\n- Don\u2019t go into social media if you don\u2019t or can\u2019t see the point in learning the skill. Freelancers come in all shapes and forms\u2026 usually in the marketing industry it\u2019s more reputable to be part of an agency. I can\u2019t say the same for graphic doesn\u2019t for example. \n\nBut again we are just offering advice having been through it.

Nothing more. Obviously it wasn't a huge mistake on your part, hence me not making a big deal about it, but now that you try to put it on me....\n\nMBB is literally because that's the entire topic of the thread....\n\n> You work for a PE roll-up/have spent your entire career in the PE space don't you? It's a totally different job doing strategy at a large company vs doing strategy at your place.\n\nNo. Buy-and-build and PE were both a small part of my career. Currently I am at a public company, low billions revenue so not huge. None of the roles that involved strategy were in a buy-and-build.\n\n>Broadly speaking\n>your strategy is already decided the day the PE fund invests (wild oversimplification, but true in the grand scheme of things)\n>.....\n>A lot of the fund's focus is on transactions and transformation, not \"strategy\". There's not a ton of strategising that can be done effectively if you need to exit within 5 years\n\nAgreed on all of the above, which is why corpdev roles in buy-and-builds never involve, nor claim to involve, strategy. \n\n> So of course you don't need an MBB and of course you don't see the value of MBBs. But your POV doesn't represent the entire market.\n\nNot sure where you got the impression from that I \"don't see the value of MBBs\". As I said multiple times, I see the value there; they service the needs of the c-suite well and when I was in PE they served me well too. What I said was that other second tier management don't see that positive side of them, they only see the negatives. Hence the reasoning behind my entire argument; that FOR THOSE PEOPLE (note again not for everybody) the \"ex-MBB\" claim isn't as positive as it is to other consultants, or as it may be to the C-Suite. That has nothing to do with my opinion, nor with the actual experience itself. Purely the experience that those at the corporates often have who aren't the direct client. \n\n> No. What makes MBBs unpleasant is not the people or the culture. It's the fact that some projects are critical and the C-suite is watching. An ex-MBB boutique would likely not get CEO-level work, or at least not the kind that involves a broad engagement with the organisation, not least because they wouldn't have enough people.\n\nSure, but other projects are also critical and that is exactly what is raised by the SBU and division heads. The projects that they have can't get put on hold due to another project that is running. They also have the c-suite, ie their direct report, watching them throughout and they have to answer to the c-suite for any delays. The people and the culture absolutely aren't bad, agreed, otherwise the same firms wouldn't be filled with ex-consultants. I don't understand how that relates to the point though..?\n\n> Finally... I'm very very very used to junior and mid-level finance professionals having a weird complex towards MBB consultants (and white shoe lawyers). It starts with kids on WSO, it continues with dorky 30yo rambling about Bain and Kirkland at parties. \n\nSorry, I know you're really, really aggressively trying to turn this into personal attacks, but if you want me to bite you're going to have to actually read something I write and come up with less generic insults than some insecure fantasies that don't pass the first sniff test to anybody. \n\n> So I'm not totally surprised by how you steer the topic back towards MBB at every message..\n\nA good summary from you, which says everything.

I\u2019d say it definitely makes it easier when you\u2019re starting out as it\u2019s much easier to create a compelling proposition for a single sector than for the mass market, and / or much easier to manage resourcing for a single service line than for 5. It might depend on what your longer term aspirations are for the agency, the niche you have in mind and also on where you\u2019re based. If you want to build a $15M revenue agency in the UK market, you\u2019d struggle to do that just targeting pest control companies for example as the market isn\u2019t big enough. You could probably build a nice 15 person agency doing just pest control in the UK that made you decent money and gave you a fairly easy life though. Specialising in a larger sector (retail, travel, financial services, B2B) in the UK market would give you scope to grow a big agency while still having a niche. US market is much bigger so I\u2019m sure you could build a big agency just focused on pest control, and a huge agency if focused on a bigger sector. It\u2019s still possible to build a successful agency without a niche, but having a niche when you\u2019re starting out definitely makes it easier.\n\nWe had certain specialisms that we focused on as an agency and those specialisms changed and evolved over close to 20 years as the agency grew, but we never fully niched down to a single sector or service. We actually started out with a very narrow focus (multilingual PPC) but that quickly expanded as we evolved and took advantage of opportunities that popped up. For example, we were only doing multilingual PPC but then clients were asking if we could also do multilingual SEO so we launched that. At one point we were doing a lot of multilingual work for retail clients and won some high profile accounts, which then attracted other retail clients that didn\u2019t need multilingual work so we started doing English-only work too. We then wanted to set up in the US and initially intended to focus on retail as we had great creds in the UK, but found it really hard to gain traction without US retail client case studies - so we pivoted back to focusing just on multilingual campaigns in the US and grew very quickly as a result. Most of the multilingual work we won in the US was with B2B clients, which then meant that we could target other B2B clients that didn\u2019t require multilingual work\u2026\n\nWe never fully niched-down to any particular service or industry and managed to grow to 150+ people, but definitely benefited from focusing on particular sectors or services at different times as we evolved. Starting out with a more narrow focus and then building out made it lot easier than if we\u2019d started as a full service agency targeting all sectors.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1762932717, "created_utc": 1762932717, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nof67hx", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1ouqu52", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nof67hx", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1ouqu52", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1ouqu52/has_hyperniching_your_agency_actually_paid_off/nof67hx/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1762932735, "saved": false, "score": 4, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 4, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "gave up answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing"], "_date": "2025-11-12"}

When they ask what you do that\u2019s better, what are you gonna say? When they ask about SEO and ranking better and what you do for that, what are you gonna say? What problems are you solving for them? What is wrong with their current site, why is it wrong, how do you fix it, and why are you uniquely able to fix it? Sales is the first Hurdle for most developers. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s a whole other way of thinking and now you have to talk to people, be personable, knowledgeable, and navigate the conversation skillfully to close the sale. It\u2019s not about the website or their old one looking bad. It\u2019s about what problems you solve. People buy solutions. And if you don\u2019t have any, you won\u2019t sell very much. So you need to work on that. What is your unique selling point, what do you do better than anyone else, and what problems you are solving for them and why it\u2019s a problem. And if all you\u2019re doing is slinging cheap crappy Wordpress themes then you are no better than Raj in Pakistan charging $200 on fiver. You can\u2019t compete and you won\u2019t solve any problems, which means you won\u2019t get referrals or repeat business because your websites just sit there like their old ones did. It looks better. But they have no traffic and no conversions. Why? If you can\u2019t answer that question then you aren\u2019t ready to start.\n\nAlso Focus on how to use flexbox and grid, transforms, transitions, mobile first coding, positioning, differences between display block and Inline block, etc. very important to have the basics mastered.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend finding a good designer to work with. You can find good ones for $20 an hour in Asia, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. They\u2019re amazing out there. My guy in Bangladesh is the core of my design team. I gave him a raise to $25 an hour. And once we keep growing I\u2019m bumping that up too and taking care of them nicely. Design is hard. I try to do it myself sometimes, but it\u2019s always just easier having someone better at it than you so you can focus on the things you do better and are more productive at. You\u2019ll be glad you did.\n\nThen there\u2019s pricing!\n\nI have two packages:\n\nI have lump sum $3800 minimum for 5 pages and $25 a month hosting and general maintenance\n\nor $0 down $175 a month, unlimited edits, 24/7 support, hosting, etc.\n\n$100 one time fee per page after 5, blog integration $250 for a custom blog that you can edit yourself.\n\nLump sum can add on the unlimited edits and support for $50 a month + hosting, so $75 a month for hosting and unlimited edits.\n\nNice, simple pricing. Simple projects. No databases. No booking features. No payment processing. Wanna know why? Because you don\u2019t have to build everything yourself. There\u2019s so many third party services out there that do niche specific booking services and perfected it for you. Just have your client set up a few demos with some companies and find the one that works best for them, their company rep will help set them up and then you get either a link to add to a button or an API script to add to a page that loads their booking platform inside of your site. I do this for everything. There\u2019s no reason to build and design your own custom booking and calendar platforms for like a local house painter. Total and absolute overkill and over engineering. Use what you have available to you. Simplify your workflow and the types of sites you make, and just do those. My niche is static 5 page small business sites. I don\u2019t want to build inventory management systems or custom forms to connect to databases and a backend, etc. I\u2019m not interested in doing that. Because I can crank out a 5 page small business site in less than a day and charge $3800 for it. The more complicated the site gets the more time it takes. I know I can do these types of sites in X amount of hours. Throw in some custom dynamic features and that can be a very wide range or Hours and I\u2019d have to maintain those systems and update them. My time is better spent pumping out higher quality static sites in a day than spending weeks on a large complicated project for $10k. I just don\u2019t do it.\n\nSo by niching down, I can better estimate my time per project, which allows me to offer simple and standard pricing because I know exactly how much I\u2019ll make and in how long.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1737053260, "created_utc": 1737053260, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m7hu3po", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1i2op4n", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m7hu3po", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1i2op4n", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1i2op4n/calling_all_web_developers/m7hu3po/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1737053275, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "gave up answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "blocker_not_ready", "positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-01-16"}

Then you get the email, hey thanks for getting us ranked! We need to pause for a month and we'll get back to this. BOOM! Fired and ghosted. \n\n  \nOr what about the client that hires you, and when you're building out there campaign, you go into the Google drive folder that you gave them a week ago to upload images and videos to be used for ads. The folder's empty, you email the client and ask for content. She says she will provide it next week. Next week the folder is still empty. You email her again and remind her you need content. She emails you back and says she's 33 weeks pregnant and doesn't feel like dealing with this. She says she's paying you enough money and you should be able to find content yourself (stock photos). You reply and tell her that we can of course use stock photos, but the ads won't perform as well that way. She replies and tells you that she wants a refund. \n\n  \nThese are just a couple examples of what we deal with on a weekly basis. For anyone blaming you and saying that all clients are perfect and will pay you on time every month with no complaints until they day the die so long as your onboarding call was up to par, doesn't actually have significant clients and has probably worked with a couple clients as a side gig over the course of their entire lives.

So...\n\nHow does ICE know where people work?   Because It's on their I-9 form.   When ICE shows up to an address with a list of names?   Those people are hired on a I-551, I-776, or I-94 form.  They pass E-Verify, and are documented legal employees.   Who under executive order are being subject to extrajudicial revokation of legal status and removed from the United States, or detained, or shipped to El Salvador.   Lots of options there.\n\nThe key word here is documented with legal status.  That's why ICE knows where they live and work.  Because the have legal documents.\n\nThe undocumented / illeagals are a totally different story.   That being said if you want to wash dishes, dig ditches, work in a slaughter house or do agricultural labor, there's not enough illeagals to fill those jobs and they will take you.  I've met some of the owners.  They take anyone with a pulse same day, and can never find enough people.\n\nBack to subject at hand.  \n\nThis is R/consulting.  So if you can't talk the talk why would anyone take you seriously.  \n\nLovely troll comments.\n\nBut when I file a change order or contract claim for $2,000,000 of labor costs due to a site shut down from an ICE Raid on on of my projects that cost us a 2 day delay and a million dollars a day of labor?  And now we have further delays and ICE related litigation. Between Owner, Prime Contractor, 3 dozen subcontractors, internal and external legal counsel, not to mention a dozen consulting firms on different sides of the problem?\n\nLike just sorting out that mess is a full time job for like 6 people for at least a year.  Been there, actually have the t-shirt.   Which is another million dollars or more in service labor costs.\n\nThen say legal action - jeez, now the lawyers cost another million on each side just to explain to the executives and shareholders there's nothing they can do other than accept it, pay for it and move on.\n\nSo end result is several million dollars of extra cost in ICE disruption remediation.  Not to mention the weeks of overtime, missed family time, closed door arguments, and meetings.\n\nAll because ICE showed up in Masks and Guns, and decided to Revoke the working Visas of a security Gaurd and a Junior electrician that were I-551 or I-776  legal immigrants with Federal Employement Authorisation.   And the wrong tatoos.\n\nSo legal counsel is basically telling me the best strategy to deal with ICE is basically to hide them, keep them quiet, and give them whatever they ask for as quickly and quietly as possible, as to save the millions of dollars of problems that happen when masked guys with guns roll up on the security gate.\n\nSeriously.  According to ICE statistics Last year over 200,000 immigrants were peacefully and quietly removed from the United States with Due Process and NOBODY CARED.  The news media didn't care, none of us knew it was happening or didn't worry about it.\n\nLike 2 dudes in suits show up with badges and a warrant; we have a 5 minute chat, call in the people they want to see; and let them quietly and professionally carry out the warrant or whatever and go about our day.  Just business and government doing their thing, I got no power.\n\nBut a few SUV's full of masked dudes in tactical gear and AR's roll up on my security gate?  Hopefully the minimum wage guy hits the panic button that dials 911 before he shits himself.\n\nEither way if guys with masks and guns show up; well there goes my day, and I just lost a day or 2 of productivity.  And hence the above scenario of millions of dollars of totally unnecessary costs caused by masked idiots with guns thinking the need to raid my clients property and disrupt THOUSANDS of people working just to revoke immigration status from a handful of people.\n\nIt's a totally unnecessary waste of energy.  They can make the same number of arrests the way they did in 2024 - as quiet professionals.  \n\nYou don't show up to a place of business with masks, guns, and tactical gear.  That's childish cowboy bullshit and totally unprofessional.   Don't take your airsoft fantasy to my place of business.  If I showed up in full tactical gear and a mask to ANYWHERE, do you think they would treat me like a trustworthy professional?   Hell no.\n\nYet this morning, we had a confidential side bar in an executive meeting because corporate needs input and risk analysis to what ICE raids can do Billion dollars projects.   We need a contingency plan and budget.  Great!  That's so what I wanted to do today.  Not like I already had a few billion dollars of risk to deal with. \n\nAnd the answer is nothing good.  We need to spend time and money on how to deal with ICE Raids when we would honestly comply with the law with a simple phone call.   Hell we would have the people wait to be picked up if you ask nicely.   Because most of us are not lawyers and want to trust our government.\n\nIf a badge and a warrant ask for something.  We may delay an hour or a day checking with legal.  But we follow the law because business and money.   \n\nAnyone suggesting \"don't hire illegals\" is an idiot.  And not under an MSA and NDA making an absurd hourly rate helping corporations navigate this childish political environment that is 2025.\n\nFeel free to troll all you want kid.

But also, you are discussing a competing idea and probably a bit naive in your own way (not bad, just you don't know what you don't know having not been on that side of the table\n\nYou are very correct in your assessment of naivete. I did have many of those conversations fairly early in my career and I really had extremely limited understanding of their world. I've worked very hard to improve on that aspect, but it has been admittedly challenging trying to look into the kitchen from outside the house.\n\nSome key takeaways from what you said that I am very happy to have you confirm are:\n\n1. SMEs are an untapped market because they are extremely hard to convert (Found out in practice)\n2. You need to package everything you do and frame it as a clear \"product\" or \"service\"  (I struggle greatly with this)\n3. Tons of success happens in silence, away from the spotlights\n4. To say that networking is key would be an understatement\n\nIn a nutshell, these 4 things that you highlight are essential, and happen to be some of the things I struggle most with, so my limited success should be no surprise at all.\n\nLooking at the advice someone else gave, I have also started down the path of getting a very specific specialization (M365 and Azure for business intelligence, AI, process improvement, automation), in the hopes that it would open doors for me to address some of those issues. For example, being able to brand myself as an implementation partner, a specialist with clear deliverables, being able to set price relative to truly comparable offerings, and having the opportunity to speak/present at events on topics that \"pull in\" people by interests to kickstart networking.\n\nI really gotta figure out how to get better at these things ASAP. \n\nThanks again!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1733760359, "created_utc": 1733760359, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m17kuta", "is_submitter": true, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1h7j5ru", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m17kuta", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t1_m0lkd4c", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1h7j5ru/is_there_an_angle_for_enterprise_or_business/m17kuta/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1733760377, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "gave up answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-12-09"}

It isn't for everyone, but my desired lifestyle needs autonomy, and it is impossible to get that in a big company, especially as you are climbing the ladder.\n\n1. 8 years ago, I dropped my normal job with vesting in retirement and stock and even gave up my health insurance to start a small consulting firm in an unrelated field.  Consulting on your own puts a much larger portion of your hourly in your pocket, and having a firm puts a portion of your employees' hourly in your pocket, but you are responsible for getting the gigs...\n\n2. 50% of our clients are organic word-of-mouth which took considerable time to build, the other 50% resulting from marketing/direct outreach.  It is industry dependant, but our industry involves highly regulated or otherwise public governmental processes, so our client pool is easy to get data for.\n\n3. Branding is different for an organization than an individual, being a thought leader is important for both.  I like to think of our firm as a brain trust in our field, and i have rounded out our staff around this goal.  I never wanted to be a sole proprietor - you can only crank your hourly so high... and you have to do actual work for every dime you make.  To me, it's better than working at a firm in terms of autonomy but it has a hard cap on revenue.\n\n4. Clients have all sorts of different needs. Our projects are varied, but we typically treat each new project type as a 1-1, and if it can be turned into a repeatable or automatable and marketable process, we make an SOP and if possible convert it to a fixed price deal\n\n5. I never started solo, but with a partner and one employee.  We staffed up pretty quick - as having additional revenue streams for the business makes everything easier and you can eventually afford support staff for admin.  We have had success doing some \"lower level\" consulting in adjacent areas, preformed by lower paid staff.  It's allowed us to take on more types of projects.\n\n6. Colaboration with other consultants is great, either through a direct collaboration, a pass-through, or just a referral (fee). Just write a good agreement. Around year 4, I noticed that we were referring a lot of the same type of work out to third parties on a regular basis, so I brought in-house any of the services we could reasonably provide, and monetized the referrals going forward.  \n\nPartnerships can be great - and also awful.  Have a good agreement - but that is only 10% of it.  It's a relationship not unlike a marriage.  I have a great situation with now two partners, but we have clearly delineated roles and responsibilities with no overlap and complete autonomy.  They are good humans, we've established extensive rules for governance and decision making, and we have SOP's for every process... and it still gets really shitty sometimes.\n\n7. Make long-term life goals before you make career goals. YMMV.  You have to do some real soul searching.  For me it was simple - more $ > less $.  Same with freedom, autonomy, family time, free-time, etc.  I dislike every aspect of the rat race, despite doing pretty well as a rat in my previous career.  It feels like a lifetime ago and I am definitely a different person now.  I can live wherever i want, I have three kids whose childhoods I am not absent from, can leave town whenever (WTF is PTO?), and if a client is being unreasonable, I can tell them to go pound sand.\n\nHappy to answer any other questions you have about striking  out on your own", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1715914422, "created_utc": 1715914422, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l4ei2ik", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1ctsyyp", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l4ei2ik", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1ctsyyp", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1ctsyyp/anyone_here_who_quit_hisher_corporate_job_to/l4ei2ik/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1715914439, "saved": false, "score": 9, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 9, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "gave up answering service", "_search_bucket": "blocker_tried_and_rejected", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_switched"], "_date": "2024-05-17"}

Honest advice: stop boosting posts. From my exerpeicne it rarely converts for law firms.\n\nInstead, start Local SEO immediately. This is your long-term engine. It involves:\n\n* Google Business Profile (GBP): The core element. It puts you in the \"Map Pack\" for local searches (e.g., \"lawyer near me\").\n* Citations: Listing your firm in directories.\n* Reviews: Social proof.\n\nPPC (Google Ads/Local Services Ads) buys instant visibility at the top of search results but requires a budget.  We often see smaller practices and solos try to compete here initially and waste budget due to a lack of ability to answer the phone in time and convert. Since funds are tight, invest into your GBP now. SEO takes months to mature; starting today builds your future pipeline.\n\nFor the GBP if you have a physical location, you'll have the best chance of ranking for target search terms. Then it's a matter of building the reviews. While you have some time, I'd also recommend you build a YouTube channel and start answering questions on video.

I know this post is years old at this point, but I noticed that no one actually answered the question. So for you, and anyone else who is curious -- yes, The Advocates and Targeted Legal Staffing Solutions are both very legitimate companies! They have the same address, list the same processes and have similar website copy because they were both founded by the same person who is currently president/CEO of both. The difference is that The Advocates works with exclusively lawyers, associates and partners, whereas Targeted Legal works with support staff and contract workers/temps (paralegals, legal assistants, office managers, and attorneys doing contract based work). There are various employees (like marketing, HR and admin) that work on both sides of the sister firms, but each company has a separate team of recruiters that are familiar with the specific market they are recruiting for. The Advocates has been around for over 20 years and has been Forbes ranked multiple times, and they work directly with many AmLaw 100 firms, hence the early access to opportunities, due to their relationship with various firms they also have the ability to directly present candidates to firms even if the firm may not be actively hiring or have any open job postings. I have worked with them in the past and they were very thoughtful, kind and professional and it felt different from working with any recruiter I've ever met in the past.

A clean site with strong attorney bios, practice areas, and a simple blog/news section can go a long way.\n\nA few lessons I\u2019ve seen firms learn the hard way:\n\n* **Avoid \u201clocked down\u201d platforms** like FindLaw or other pay-to-play services. They tend to overcharge, underdeliver, and make it hard to update your own content.\n* **Wix and Squarespace** are fine for DIY, but they usually hit a ceiling if you want to grow traffic, run SEO, or make the site look truly polished.\n* **WordPress** is the standard for law firms. It gives you total control, is SEO-friendly, and lets you easily post updates or articles without needing a middleman.\n* **SEO matters more than you think.** Even if referrals drive most of your work, a well-optimized site helps establish credibility and can bring in co-counsel or higher-value cases you might not have expected.\n\nI work with law firms on web design and marketing, and what I usually recommend is: start with a clean, conversion-focused WordPress site that reflects your brand and is easy to manage. Then you can layer on SEO or paid ads later if you want more traffic \u2014 but you\u2019ll already have a solid foundation.\n\nWould love to answer any questions you may have:   \n[https://tylerperez.com](https://tylerperez.com)", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1758056486, "created_utc": 1758056486, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "neldsiv", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_14prwss", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_neldsiv", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_14prwss", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/14prwss/best_approach_to_smallfirm_websites_and_seo/neldsiv/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1758056503, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2025-09-16"}

California family law. I\u2019ve been on my own for about 2.5 years and was at a firm before that. \n\nI will say that I do zero advertising. I am currently (knock on wood) 100% word of mouth referrals. Back when I was at a firm, we did paid advertising and 100% paid consults. While I didn\u2019t handle the intake calls (we had an office manager for that) I do know that we charged $475 for a 1 hour consult and that a lot of the potential clients from the paid services dropped off when they heard about the cost. Great! Fine. They probably wouldn\u2019t pay anyway. \n\nNow I usually only do paid consults when I *don\u2019t* know the potential client is coming from a good source. I know the source because, before I speak with anyone ever, I have them fill out an online intake form. The intake form isn\u2019t just for conflict checks but also asks about salary, property and who referred them. If the potential new client refuses to fill it out, fine but we\u2019re not talking unless and until they do. \n\nThat said, I work with a number of entertainment lawyers, real estate lawyers, business managers and the like. Let\u2019s say I did a divorce for Actor A two years ago and Actor A\u2019s entertainment law attorney, John Smith, passed along my contact information to Actor B, who the entertainment lawyer also represents. I might see that Actor B wrote on their intake form that John Smith referred them. I\u2019ll do that call for free because, almost invariably, I\u2019m the only divorce attorney this person wants to bother contacting. Assuming I seem normal on the phone, 9/10 times, they\u2019ll hire me by the end of the call. \n\nIf I don\u2019t know the referral source, I\u2019ll take a look at what the potential client wants and what their resources look like based on answers to the intake questions. In the US, you can very easily look up addresses and home values on Redfin. If they live in a $7M single family home and they want a prenup, I probably won\u2019t charge for a consult, because it\u2019s probably a good case and the call is unlikely to take too much time. They probably just want to talk to someone professional and nice and check that box and be done with it. If I can\u2019t read into the information on the intake form AND I don\u2019t know the referral source, I\u2019ll likely charge. \n\nAll that said, I think those online referral things are absolute shit. You\u2019re probably better off networking with other lawyers and advertising in a hyper local way. Other lawyers are a terrific resource because 1) when people need a family law attorney, they\u2019re likely to ask for a referral from the only lawyer(s) they know and 2) if someone can afford the first lawyer, they can probably afford the second. Try meeting with trusts and estates lawyer, real estate lawyers and small business type lawyers. Get to know them so you\u2019re the first person they\u2019ll recommend when someone calls them and asks for a divorce referral. Secondly, hyper specific local advertising is probably the way I\u2019d go if I did advertising. There\u2019s an elementary school around the corner from me that sells ad space in their weekly parents\u2019 newsletter. The school is in a nice, upmarket area. The parents are probably monied enough to own a single family home. They probably have decent careers as doctors, lawyers, dentists etc. So, they probably have some money and they definitely have kids. I think people are also more likely to trust hyper local specific advertising than they are to trust a google ad.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1747350404, "created_utc": 1747350404, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "msj8vcm", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1kmca9r", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_msj8vcm", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1kmca9r", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1kmca9r/family_law_paid_consultations_vs_free/msj8vcm/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1747350422, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_switched", "pricing"], "_date": "2025-05-15"}

One gigabit is essentially the speed of a slow traditional hard drive, which makes working from the cloud doable in my experience.\n\nFor bookkeeping, find a good accountant , and use the software that your accountant wants you to use.\n\nConsider having an answering service to present a \"bigger\" outward appearance if you need to. I am solo, and I do not use such a service.\n\nFor hardware, I recommend one trick ponies, such as the following:\n\nPrinter with USB, Ethernet, and wifi connectivity for flexibility. I prefer Brother black and white laser printers, because they work well in the Mac and Windows (and Linux) worlds.\n\nSheet feed scanner is useful. Fujitsu (a RICOH Company) ScanSnap is the 800 pound gorilla, but there are plenty of worthy competitors. Every document gets the OCRed immediately, because the document content may be your only way to find a misfiled document. Each person handling paper gets their own sheet feed scanner.\n\nGet a flatbed scanner if you need it.\n\nGet fax as a software service if you really think you need it. A decade ago I needed it. Now, I do not.\n\nGet a refurbished laptop with full warranty what a hefty amount of RAM and local storage so that you don't have to think about upgrading for these reasons ever, which means that you're buying the laptop from the manufacturer and saving money. Have a back up computer in case something goes wrong with your main computer, so that you can keep working while the main computer is being replaced or repaired. If going the Windows route, choose a big brand name with a long-term warranty.\n\nGet a big widescreen monitor so that you can read at least 3 documents at once. I use the # ViewSonic VA3456-MHDJ 34\" 21:9 IPS Monitor because I can view three documents side by side at arms length.\n\nSoftware oriented tools:\n\nPlease read <https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software>\\](https://www.attorneyatwork.com/long-nine-essential-software-modern-law-practice/#h-4-document-management-software)\n\nNotice that case management software (Clio, Lawcus, etc.) can be duplicative of the other 8 items on the list, which raises the question of whether one actually needs case management software. I prefer the \u00e0 la carte best in breed approach. Shrug.\n\nOf course, you need antivirus software. I like bitdefender total security or whatever they're now calling it.\n\nYou need a password manager. I like 1password that I have used for a decade. The ability to have a share vault for passwords that you can share with an assistant is valuable.\n\nGiven my druthers, I would choose a Mac over a Windows machine, because it will run better in my experience and Mac has some cool software. However  I work on Windows, because I need Dragon NaturallySpeaking speech to text software for its custom vocabulary training and voice editing capabilities. I also need a specific piece of software that is only available on the Windows platform for my practice area.\n\nThis post is already long enough.

DV cases aside, family law is generally an area of law where everyone sucks fairly equally just in different ways. You\u2019ll get a client. Hear their side.

There\u2019s very little law to argue and you can\u2019t control what the court does. You are there to argue on behalf of your client and to know what to ask for. Set boundaries on that. When you start getting stressed. Stop what you\u2019re doing and take a minute to remember that boundary. Reset your nervous system. Make good habits like this in the beginning and it will help.

And not all channels are good at both capture and generation. \n\nSearch (SEO and ads) is one of the channels that works great on both side of the equation (which is why Google is so valuable as a business):   \n\\- You can capture existing demand by targeting search terms like \"will solicitor near me\", \"estate attorney near me\", \"best will law firm in \\[location\\]\", etc.   \n\\- You can generate demand by targeting search terms like: \"what does getting your affairs in order mean?\", \"when should one plan for end of life?\", \"Is it worth writing a will in 202\\[5\\]?\"\n\nSocial media advertising is also good at both, though it is better at generating demand than capturing it. This is because you don't go on Instagram to look for a solicitor, you go to see updates from your friends, memes. You might stumble upon an ad about a will solicitor just as you were thinking about getting yours done, but that's not why you went on social initially. \n\nSo typically, the way you would use social media is as follows:   \n\\- You would run a demand generation campaign: for example an ad saying \"Have you got your affairs in order? Discover the 10 steps 40+ years old should take to avoid family disputes after their passing.\" (that's just an example). Now, people who click on this ad could be interested in getting their will done, we've generated the demand!  \n\\- Then, the next step would be to capture the demand we've just generated. For this, you would retarget everybody who engaged with the previous ad with a demand capture ad, for example: \"10% off will writing at [Example.com](http://Example.com), get your affairs in order today!\".    \n\\- And then we would layer another retargeting campaign on top, targeting everybody who has been on your website and hasn't converted into a lead/client with case studies and other brand focused content aimed at helping them choose your law firm: \"Highly recommend [Example.com](http://Example.com), I used them to write my will, now I have peace of mind knowing that my affairs are in order - John Doe\"  \n  \nThat's a very simplistic example, but you get the idea: on one hand we capture demand from people actively looking for our solutions, and on the other we plant the seeds (like in Inception, the movie) that will motivate people who had not thought about our solutions yet. \n\nThe same principles of demand gen and demand capture apply to offline advertising (billboard, TV, radio, etc.), though the impact is harder to measure (there's no pixel, click to tracked, etc.).\n\nHope this helps!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1732815475, "created_utc": 1732815475, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lzfp5hi", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1ge6w4f", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lzfp5hi", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1ge6w4f", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1ge6w4f/wills_and_estates_firm_advertising/lzfp5hi/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1732815490, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["positive"], "_date": "2024-11-28"}

I'll weigh in on the pricing of websites and SEO. There are two schools of thought. And typically, if you are paying for a monthly fee, you are still better off than a one-time set it and forget it with the website. The hosting, support, security, etc that comes with monthly is worth it - and you can get SEO bundled in. \n\nThere are a few companies out there that can get real results for around $1k/month - possibly a little higher, but not much. The thing to understand here is they need to be doing actual work - what are the deliverables? The reason so many firms are burned about SEO is that it's easy to say you are \"doing work\" but not actually doing anything as many attorneys don't know or don't have the time to keep up with it. Companies I'm aware of in these price ranges that we've dealt with include: PaperStreet, Civille, MeanPug.

We also collect their credit card info through the online form to pay for the consult (we currently charge $250 and provide a 1-hour substantive consult)\n\nEach of those leads goes to a paralegal who vets them. They usually do a brief call and review the notes from the online intake form / LEX Reception. From there they'll either politely refund them & cancel the appointment if it's clearly a bad fit and refer out if possible, ask me or my boss if they're on the fence on whether to cancel it or not, or confirm the appointment's availability on our calendar and either confirm or on rare occasions reschedule with the PNC as necessary. \n\nThen it gets put on the calendar of whichever of us is handling it - we do nearly all of our consults via Zoom or Phone (client's preference) except for some very special circumstances. We hop on the consult, talk with them for about an hour and provide substantive advice on the best way to proceed with the divorce or custody case or whatever else it is. Then we'll talk with them about our process for hiring and usually tell them over the phone how much of a retainer we want unless it's a case that I need to speak to my boss about before setting an amount for some reason. \n\nAt the end, if the client is interested in hiring, I'll have my paralegal send a retainer contract for e-signature & a payment link for the retainer to the PNC. Once they sign, we add them to Clio and start their case. \n\nOverall, the process to get from PNC to new hire doesn't take up very much staff time. Vetting is about 30 minutes of paralegal time, intake call is an hour of attorney time, and sending the contract is about another 15-20 minutes of paralegal time.\n\nOnce they hire we assign it to a paralegal who handles nearly everything for the beginning of the case. We have a staff of very experienced, board certified family law paralegals. Since we've already usually talked to the new client about a litigation plan in our consult, the paralegals are usually able to work the case up to the point of filing without much input from us unless the client has legal questions that weren't answered at the consult. Usually my first interaction with a new file is reviewing the initial pleadings the paralegal drafted to approve them for filing. \n\nOverall it works good - we have a few kinks we're in the process of improving - namely trying to shift much of the intake work from my boss over to me and integrate my role into the process a bit better since most of these processes were set up when she was solo. We're also considering running a trial of free-consults to see if the additional load on our paralegals and me is worth the increase in consults, but we're not quite there yet. \n\nAnd all of that might be entirely irrelevant to you depending on your practice area, but I figured I'd share what we're doing in case it gives anybody else any ideas.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1710405854, "created_utc": 1710405854, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kut48s0", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1bd8w3v", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kut48s0", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_1bd8w3v", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1bd8w3v/client_intake_length/kut48s0/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1710405866, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-03-14"}

To answer your questions directly:\n\n1. You need general transactional experience but mainly finance. Sure there are books out there but you do have to live it as there a lot of moving parts. I can't imagine someone being able to draft and negotiate the finance docs (look at [https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/](https://nvca.org/model-legal-documents/) to see what is involved in a single round of financing) for a seed round without seeing it done a few times and being able to dip your toe in here and there. Depending on the startup, there could be a number of different types of contracts that you would need to know your way around (organizational docs, manufacturing agreements, SaaS agreements, indemnification agreements, confidentiality agreements,  and other various service and partnership agreements). Unfortunately your current experience does not translate well (just as I wouldn't know the first thing about criminal or family law, or litigation for that matter).\n2. Two books I would recommend to get started in this world are Venture Deals by Brad Feld and A Manual of Style for Contract Drafting, Fifth Edition by Ken Adams.\n3. It is workable as a solo but you would likely need some support staff like a paralegal or two. Lot's of docs to draft and process and lots of redlines going back and forth during negotiations.\n\nWhile possibly less stressful than family and criminal law, it definitely has it's own set of headaches. Tight deadlines, long hours, demanding clients and opposing counsels, and lots of fire drills due to inexperienced and unorganized executives. Responses to emails are expected in minutes and you are absolutely expected to be a master to the point where you have the law and processes memorized (\"give me a day to research that for you\" does not cut it). These are startups that are hiring you for your expertise to help them navigate the law and don't have time for your inexperience so they will absolutely leave you for someone else that seemingly knows more and responds faster.\n\nHappy to chat more if you have any other questions.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1688579783, "created_utc": 1688579783, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jqs9159", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_14rdzuo", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jqs9159", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_14rdzuo", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/14rdzuo/venture_capital_and_startups/jqs9159/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1688579815, "saved": false, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 6, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2023-07-05"}

This could be a higher initial outlay but a cheaper cost over time as you would just have your call and line rental charges for the most part and your maintainers fees, and you can have unlimited staff answering and making calls based on how many \"lines\" your SIP trunk came with.\n\nThe other way to do it is to purchase a managed phone service. This is more expensive over time as you will have a monthly fee per user. The costs are difficult to quantify as it will depend on the package and what exactly comes with it, but generally speaking its more expensive over time than running your own PBX but all the headaches are taken away from you (But they are kind of negated if you have a maintainer so its a juggle). The upsides to managed phone services is they often come with phone hardware as part of the package without having to lay out cash for phones, so you might have the benefit of physical phones at a spread out cost (They aren't free they get priced in over the lifetime of your contract).\n\nWe aren't allowed to make recommendations here but if you google \"VOIP providers France\" or \"SIP trunk provider in France\" it should get you going in the right direction.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1759498022, "created_utc": 1759498022, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "nhjjoj3", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1nwxx4c", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_nhjjoj3", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1nwxx4c", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1nwxx4c/softphone_multiple_users_one_number_one_call_at_a/nhjjoj3/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1759498041, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2025-10-03"}

I don't see how that saves you any money.  You still have to pay for a phone service provider like Vonage, et al.\n\nTo answer your original question, yes, you can run a PHONE SERVER on cheap hardware at home. This is simple enough for someone who has been down that road, but darn tricky the first time through.  Issues:  Selecting which freeware software, 3CX, Asterisk and FreeSwitch are big ones.  Then you still have to have a provider who routes the calls to your server. Most of those providers are far cheaper than typical home service like Vonage and some can support going straight to a soft or hard phone. You may lose features like voice mail, you may not.\n\nIf you are a web developer type, check out TWILIO.COM - I am very happy there but I have a webserver to handle the custom routing and setup Voice Mail on.  If not, maybe look at VOIP.MS or 1000 others.  \n  \nIf you try to put a \"server\" in your home without a statis IP address, you will likely have to update every time it changes. A far worse problem is dealing with NAT (network address translation) to your server behind a typical home router.  (NAT is the thing that allows lots of home devices to all share your ONE external IP address).  SIP (voip protocol) to/from a server that is NAT forwarding can be a nightmare resulting in lots of different problems: one way audio, outgoing calls only, no connection at all, everything works until your router's NAT connection times out, then no more inbound calls, calls drop after 5 or 10 minutes, etc. I had a very very bad time fighting NAT over the years. Granted things are much better now and the problem is not bad if the SERVER is not behind NAT and the phones are.\n\nIMHO, you are better off using your time to make money (part time) or looking for a new job.

Friends & Family\nNumber 2.) Work, Colleagues, Networking, and Business Responsibilities \nNumber 3.) Personal Business and MFA like banking and securing your social media profiles\n\nIn this scenario, numbers 1 and 2 could be VoIP if you want but honestly a regular number is probably easier.\n\nVoIP is often tailored towards business and corporate use which is what causes a lot of VoIP setups to become pretty complex like those used for office phone systems. However, there\u2019s a thriving personal VoIP business in the US with services like TextNow, TextFree, TextMe, and apps like that.\n\nIf you want to get started with personal VoIP, I\u2019d recommend getting a [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com) number. It\u2019s a FREE VoIP number you can get from Google using a Google Account that you can use for calls and texts via the Google Voice mobile app or at voice.google.com on a computer. The service is actually designed to give you one phone number that \u201crings across all of your phones.\u201d So during signup, it\u2019ll ask you to verify a real cellular phone number and you can add more as well. The way it works is that if someone calls your Google Voice number, Google Voice in turn calls all the linked phone numbers (like say your cell phone and landline) so that you can answer on whatever phone you\u2019re close to. You don\u2019t need to use it this way, though. Just link your cell number during setup, then delete it in the account settings and download the Google Voice app on your phone. You\u2019ll get a Google Voice number that you can make and receive calls and texts to/from. On the app, make sure you set calls to use data and not cellular (otherwise the app will make you link your real phone number back when you don\u2019t need to). Each Google Account can have one Google Voice number so you can get a second number by using a second Google Account. The only exception to that rule is if you get a new number from Google Voice and then port a second one in, in which case you can keep both on the same Google Voice account.\n\n\nApps like TextFree, TextNow, and TextMe work pretty good too but do have a lot of adverts.\n\n\nAnother route is to just get prepaid phone numbers. If your phone is an iPhone XR / XS or newer, it supports dual SIM so you can have one physical SIM card and one eSIM on your phone, both active at the same time with two different phone numbers. If you have an iPhone 13 or later, you can have two eSIMs active at once (instead of 1 pSIM and 1 eSIM), allowing you two phone numbers that way. The benefit in this is you\u2019d have two cellular phone numbers meaning neither would require some extra app (likely with lots of ads). When you use a prepaid carrier like US Mobile (they\u2019re awesome btw - saying that as a customer who loves them), Visible (they suck balls), Tello, Hello Mobile, or others, you can provide any random name and address you want to set up an account so it\u2019s pretty anonymous in that regard as well, making it hard for someone to trace the phone number back to you unless it\u2019s because of something you do with it.\n\nIn a dual SIM scenario, you could have 2 carrier numbers and one VoIP (likely Google Voice) to use for the three different types of numbers if you use the model from my earlier example. Whatever you want to do, the choice is yours. Being private is totally doable with VoIP or other options we discussed as well. Decide how you want to break up the different categories of your life that need phone numbers and how you want to sort them out, just making sure that whatever number you use for MFA stuff is a cellular one.\n\nBest of luck!", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1729208244, "created_utc": 1729208244, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lsg2023", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1g61uzc", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lsg2023", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1g61uzc", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/1g61uzc/new_to_voip_need_recommendations_to_start/lsg2023/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1729208260, "saved": false, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 1, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust"], "_date": "2024-10-17"}

We mostly use phone calls for communication, but our main line can also be texted, which functions as a crisis hotline for current or new clients. We have had so so so many issues with OneTalk dropping calls, not loading texts, failing to sync up between devices, connectivity issues of all kinds... over it. And the customer service stinks.\n\nCurrently, we have 5 team members with cell phones (each has the OneTalk user app) plus one desk phone. All through Verizon. Not married to these devices or service plan.\n\nLooking for VoIP recommendations that satisfy these needs:\n\n1. Central line that rings on at least 6 phones (whether simultaneously or when not answered by another employee)\n2. Text feature is a must. Our current OneTalk number can be texted or called.\n\nBonus features:\n\n1. Would be dreamy if program could be accessed on a Mac or PC as well (even just the text feature)\n2.

If you have and need a physical fax machine you'll need to get an analog Telephone Adapter (ATA) that will let the fax machine send and receive via the VoIP service.

Go through and find people you know, ex-colleagues, ex-clients etc. and ask for their help. Do some favours for people in return for case studies, referrals etc. You have to be bold and it may be uncomfortable reaching back out to people, but if done properly it should get you to the first stage of revenue growth before you need to do anything else.\n\nPartnerships have always been good to me - find companies or agencies that work with the kind of clients you're targeting, but that don't compete with you, and work out a way where you can benefit each other through referrals or doing joint-projects.\n\nI've seen people build large successful agencies through posting on LinkedIn, but it requires a lot of time and effort to do properly, and it usually only works well when the person is naturally good at (and enjoys) self-promotion. I see a lot of people choosing LinkedIn as their lead gen channel, and it's often because they find it easy to post content rather than get out and network or speak to people. Getting out and speaking to as many people as possible will generate far more leads than posting on LinkedIn in the early days.\n\nI'd also advise setting yourself some targets as making sure you stick to them (non-negotiable). If you want to win 1 new client you may need to send 2 proposals, to send 2 proposals you may need to soeak to 5 people, to speak to 5 people you may need to reach out to 100 people. So if you want to win 1 new client per month, make sure you reach out to 100 people every month without fail.\n\nFor question 2 - an agency is a services business which means you'll always have to hire people to deliver work. Hiring and managing people can be challenging but it's not something you can avoid doing if you want to grow an agency. Sounds like you've had a bad experience with hiring in-house so far - I'd think about why it didn't work out and learn from that experience. Were they the right person? Were they properly motiatved? Did they get the support that they needed?

I\u2019ve helped agencies and other service businesses tackle this exact split, so I\u2019ll share what\u2019s worked (and what hasn\u2019t) from real projects.\n\nYou\u2019re spot on that C-level marketing execs aren\u2019t hanging out on YouTube for tactical \u201chow to\u201d content. They\u2019re more likely to search on Google, skim LinkedIn, or get recommendations in their network. For lead gen in that space, I\u2019ve found YouTube is usually a slow burn unless you\u2019re producing high-level thought leadership or case study content that gets embedded, shared, or referenced elsewhere.\n\nA few practical things to consider:\n\n- YouTube can absolutely build authority and help with SEO, but for C-level direct clients it\u2019s unlikely to be a primary lead source unless you\u2019re investing heavily in strategic, high-quality content (think: roundtables with other execs, sharing original research, or deep dives into industry trends). These videos are more likely to get shared internally or referenced in decision-making, rather than discovered organically.\n- For white-label/agency owner leads, if cold email is working and you\u2019ve got the system down, I\u2019d double down there and use YouTube as a content asset to reinforce credibility rather than as a core channel. You could create specific videos that answer common objections, showcase client wins, or explain your process - these can be linked in outbound, on your site, or in proposals.\n- If you do go the YouTube route, focus on content you can repurpose. A well-produced client case study, panel discussion, or explainer video can be sliced up for LinkedIn, your website, or email nurture sequences. This approach maximizes ROI and visibility across channels.\n- Don\u2019t underestimate the SEO value of video if optimized properly. Even if your C-level prospects aren\u2019t searching YouTube directly, your videos can rank in Google search, especially for branded or high-intent queries.\n\nPersonally, as the founder of AI Automation Agent, I\u2019ve seen the best results when video is positioned as a trust-builder and authority play, not as the top-of-funnel channel for executive leads. For agency owners or more \u201chands-on\u201d ICPs, it can work as a lead driver, but expect a longer ramp-up and more indirect impact for C-level targets.\n\nHappy to dig deeper or share specific examples if helpful - what\u2019s your current split of revenue between white-label and direct clients?

Do you want to work with \"immature\" cash-strapped but plentiful startups or \"mature\" cash-rich but fewer established companies?

They prefer someone local, someone they know, or someone who comes recommended. That gives them a warm and fuzzy feeling. That\u2019s where local niching works. You\u2019re the \u201cgo-to\u201d agency in your area.\n\nAs companies grow, they start to value industry expertise. They want an agency that already understands their space. They shouldn't ask you what a conversion is, and you shouldn't have to help them find product/market fit \u2014 they already get it. That\u2019s when industry niching makes sense.\n\nEven more mature companies, even those with in-house teams, look for discipline experts. They don\u2019t want a full-service agency. They want someone who does one thing really well\u2014PPC, SEO, email, etc. That\u2019s specialization niching.\n\nThe top of the value chain is hyper-niching, when you combine both industry and discipline niching, like PPC for SaaS or email marketing for e-commerce tech.

It sounds like you're starting on because some guy on YouTube told you it's a good way to make extra money.\n\nIf that's not the case -- sorry for making the assumption.\n\nI came to this conclusion because it seems like you only know what the videos told you rather than actually diving in and getting a real understanding of what it is you're doing because you actually like the service you're delivering rather than the idea of the outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I will answer all of your questions anyways:\n\n1. What Niche should I be targeting?\n   1. Whatever niche you want. The niche should be specific to you and something you enjoy. You need to become an expert in your niche if you actually want to grow and retain clients long term and build authority. Don't be in a niche you hate.\n2. What should be my offer?\n   1. Whatever it is you're selling. I hate this idea that gurus preach that everyone has to have an \"offer\" that's enticing. Does what you sell offer value on its own? Then that's the offer. If it doesn't, then maybe what you sell isn't something people want.\n   2. Also, you addressed this later on when you said you'd be willing to work for free to gain experience. That's an offer...\n3. You need the following things in my opinion (Episode 1 of our podcast also covers all of this):\n   1. Website (or landing page). You can build a simple one on Wix. My vote is always WordPress but it has a pretty hefty learning curve if you're new.\n      1. This includes a domain, CMS, and hosting provider. You can technically get all three from Wix. I don't recommend it later on down the road, but that's the easiest and most affordable solution right now for you.\n   2. A way to collect payments. I vote Stripe.\n   3. A separate bank account from your person bank account. Keep the money separate.\n   4. If you're in the US, that's all you need. You can operate as a sole prop without registering an LLC. However, I still recommend resisting as an LLC to protect your personal assets in case someone decides to come after you for whatever reason. You can use a service like Legal Zoom to do that.\n4. How can I convince someone to use me?\n   1. Just be honest. Don't lie about your experience. Tell them you're starting an agency around a specific service you offer and you'd like to work for them for free, a discounted rate, or a pay per performance model. Everyone starts somewhere and when you're working with actual business owners, they know that. When you offer this, you'll attract smaller business owners who can't afford actual lead gen agencies. As you start charging for your services, your types of clients will change. So just be aware of that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAddressing your other questions:\n\n1. How should I structure my day right now?\n   1. By building your brand. Build your website. Find forums, publications, podcasts, Youtube channels, etc that your niche follows and provide your advice. Don't pitch your services, just provide genuine advice with no pitch. Lurkers get curious and reach out to you. It takes some time so be patient.\n2. How much cold outreach should I be doing daily?\n   1. I'm not a proponent of cold outreach so I don't have great advice on this. All of our clients are inbound through SEO and partner referrals. But from the perspective of someone who gets cold outreached all the time, build rapport first. Give free value before you ask for it in return.\n   2. If you're sending a lot of emails out, you're going to want to get a domain and make sure your SPF and DKIM records are updated or everything you do is going to end up in spam.\n3. What structure should I include in my cold outreach messages?\n   1. No idea.

Don\u2019t start an agency, get your brother to start freelancing first. I recommend he get started on Upwork. Outside of Upwork you need to convince people they need the service AND that you\u2019re a good choice for the job. Inside people are already looking for what you offer.\n\n2. Build a portfolio of 3 sites before he starts freelancing. He can work for very cheap for your network \u2014 family, friends, local businesses you may know. And of course, build your agency website and make sure it\u2019s a jewel first.\n\n3. Once both you and him have solid case studies and experience, then move outside of Upwork and begin looking for work.

Just wanted to say that the agency model is very hard. Don't get discouraged and keep trying new things. Here are some ideas that can potentially help you out:\n\n1. I would like to begin this list by mentioning an important point. When you start a service-based business, it typically means that you have mastered a craft and have reached a stage where you can provide real value to other people who are looking for that skill. In the beginning, I recommend solely focusing on the abilities that make YOU unique. For example, in my own case, I started helping people with designing their websites even though my main true skill was software engineering. This was really because I was prioritizing immediate cash flow rather than a long-term vision. \n2. Once you have niched down your services, it's now time to figure out who your ideal customers are. I will be writing a detailed post on how I did this for my consulting business but here's a quick summary:\n   1. Reverse engineer your customer.\n   2. Assume that you are someone who has recently purchased your services and answer the following questions: who am I? when did I buy? why did I buy? what exactly did I buy?\n   3. Go into as much detail when answering these questions. You will thank me later.\n   4. After doing so, you will be able to see a few potential avatars for your business. Pick the one that feels the best to you and whom you're confident servicing. \n3. Once you have determined your ICP, it's time to implement your marketing channels. This will be highly custom for your business so I won't go into exact details but there are typically 4 main avenues of customer acquisition:\n   1. Warm outreach: message people that you know. start an actual conversation. ask them if they know anyone who is interested in your services. DO NOT ask them if they want to buy.\n   2. Cold outreach: message people that you don't know. I recommend looking into [instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai). Their free training program is amazing for this.\n   3. Content: This is what I'm personally spending a lot of time on these days. creating an online brand is definitely worth the effort. Give without asking and you will reap the rewards.\n   4. Paid ads: Google Ads. Meta Ads, etc. I also recommend going with more niche avenues. For example, if you are building a product and have the budget, pay IndieHackers to feature them in their weekly newsletter!\n4. Some bonus channels:\n   1. Referrals: message your previous customers and ask who in their contacts is a great potential customer (like them) for your services. You can further increase the chance of closing this lead by providing a personalized coupon with an expiration.\n   2. Partner with other agencies and affiliates. For example, if you offer web design services, team up with marketing agencies!\n\nHope this helps!\n\nParsa", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1695423653, "created_utc": 1695423653, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "k1s586r", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_16pj8ga", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_k1s586r", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_16pj8ga", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/16pj8ga/where_are_you_guys_finding_clients_other_than/k1s586r/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1695423671, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["positive", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-09-22"}

Any leads that are not ready to convert we plug them into the appropriate lead nurturing work flow until they are ready to convert.

I do analytics! Hey!\") to people who, in 95 percent of the cases, won't even know why they might need analytics right now, and spend 0.2 percent of their week thinking about data and stuff, if that. A generic, non-specific solicitation means you put the onus of figuring out what you could do for them ON THEM - and now more than ever, the result of this is almost always... crickets.\n\nHence, my recommendation: really focus in on a specific segment (e.g., \"SaaS Start-ups seeking their C-round in these very difficult times,\" \"HR leaders tasked with reducing churn,\" etc.), and the research and identify the business's pain (!) you can solve for them.\n\nThen, speak directly to their issue, pitching a solution (different from a capability!).\n\nThis is particularly important in your case, because not many orgs have functions which have 'analytics' in their  job description; it's something a lot of the people might need at very few times (and those who do have 'analytics' teams aren't necessarily your ideal clients, because all they'll do is hire you as staff aug, at shitty rates, IF that).\n\nSo, very few people go into the office in the mornings thinking \"I need some analytics.\" Lots of people need better forecasts though, HR insights, improved inventory management, or much more helpful answers to \"WTF works in marketing and what doesn't?\" (I made these up).\n\nWhich is why you'll have to identify and put forth a solution for resolving a business issue (bonus points if it's an issue that firmly \"sits\" in a function/is owned by somebody with targets and a budget: Finance, HR, Supply Chain, Marketing [and the groups within these... No need to market to the CFO if you can serve the junior treasurer and be profitable!]).\n\nSo, again try to specify your \"who\" and \"what\" until it's ridiculously narrow, then try again.\n\nOh, and: if you can, specify an outcome, too (difficult when you start out, I know) - \"I increase forecast accuracy by x,\" \"I typically find y savings opportunities in an average trucking start parts supply chain, which usually unlock mid-six figures in cost reductions\"... Things of this nature). \n\nIf you get this right, you'll be able to write super-short emails that really resonate. Think: \"Hey, elrooto, need to get your forecasts in shape before your next investor pitch meeting? I increase forecast accuracy by x percent using y, and give clients their results in IB-grade decks (i.e., not just spreadsheets). Engagements start at 6k/week, 11k/for a 2 week sprint. Care to discuss?\"\n\nSee what we did here?\n\nSpecificity and clarity are a must especially in cold outreach*; if you want people to say \"yes,\" you have to give them something to say yes to...\n\nKeep refining and going, you got this!\n\n*I can't overstate how important it is to nail your offer and delivery (somewhat) before outreach is important!", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1687016416, "created_utc": 1687016416, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1687018817, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "johb5qa", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_14at1c3", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_johb5qa", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_14at1c3", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/14at1c3/data_analytics_agency/johb5qa/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1687016447, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2023-06-17"}

The buddy is ideally a medium to long term standing staff who can help the new hire (aside from the hire\u2019s immediate manager) for any support or guidance. \n\nWe use BambooHR to help build a checklist of all the things a new employee needs to have/know - and it automatically assigns a bunch of tasks to the manager, buddy, HR, IT etc. \n\nIf they are going to be assigned to an existing platform/project, then they are given time to review all the notes, guides, and documentation about that project. For larger projects of clients we have had for a number of years, we have built a little quiz (10-20 questions) that they have to answer after they\u2019ve read about the platform. \n\nIn a similar vein, we also have off boarding processes (also managed in BambooHR) to collect feedback, turn off access, etc. when someone leaves. \n\nAfter 2-3 weeks of starting, each new hire fills a feedback form to assess their onboarding experience with the agency. We found that hires who rated the onboarding experience more positively, performed better and stayed with the agency longer. So for us, it\u2019s a crucial step. \n\nThe above is primarily done for full time staff - rather than contractors (though for contractors they do review the project docs and any associated quizzes for their assigned work). \n\nApologies that I can\u2019t share any specific examples, as a lot of it is IP we\u2019ve created about our agency and strategic vision which is intertwined in our write ups. It gets reviewed each year. \n\nHope it helps, and I can highly recommend building your onboarding process out as I it directly relates to staff retention.

The critical thing though is you're able to offering something unique (beyond just charging less). \n\nI've shared this advice a lot on this Reddit recently, but feels appropriate here too. \n\n\u200b Let met know if this helps.\n\n1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. [I wrote a lot about this here](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).\n2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with. [Here are six options - just pick one for now](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-methodhttps://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-method) \\- the ones that feel best suited to you. Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.\n3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. [Make it a habit to set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have. Follow up on these calls too.\n4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.\n5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. This gives you a level of portability you don\u2019t get with YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other channels.\n6. **Create a strong website experience**. Make sure you [develop a website which will give your audience what they really need](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-develop-a-better-website-for). Post your best content on it. Make sure it includes case studies and testimonials. Make it a place for people to visit and explore your philosophy and successes.\n7. **Learn how to sell consultancy services**. Read some of the top sales blogs out there and [develop a process from taking an interested lead into a client](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-sell-consultancy-services). Learn how to guide leads to what they should be doing and how to fill the gap for them.\n8. **Know what should be in a consultancy contract**. Have a professional firm create your consultancy contracts. Spend a little time knowing [what should and shouldn't be in them](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/what-should-be-in-your-contracts).\n\nThere are a lot of great resources out there too.

It's not impossible, but it makes things a little trickier. Like most things, the more you can invest the better the results you will have. So I'd set aside a little budget for this. \n\nI'd be mindful that if you want a book to attract more than the average number of sales (300 copies) you need to build a large following. At the beginning you're going to be scrapping your way to the first few hundred followers - but overtime people will naturally come to you. \n\n\u200b I'd suggest the following - most of which are low-cost ideas:\n\n1. **Build an audience which follows you for unique expertise they can't get anywhere else**. I can't stress enough that if you want a consistent source of work you have to build your own audience. You need people who read your newsletter, blog, watch your videos etc...for expertise. [I wrote a lot about this here](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-following-in-2023).\n2. **Select the right client-acquisition method for you**. Find the client acquisition method you're most comfortable with. [Here are six options - just pick one for now](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-methodhttps://richardmillington.substack.com/p/pick-your-client-acquisition-method) \\- the ones that feel best suited to you. Whichever method you use, you have to really commit to being excellent at it. This should take at least 50% of your time in the beginning.  \n\n3. **Schedule calls with people in your sector**. [Make it a habit to set up calls with people in your sector](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-staying-at-the-cutting). Do this several times a week. The purpose is to exchange insights. You share what you're learning, they share what they're learning. Always make sure you can add value and insight others don't have. Follow up on these calls too. \n4. **Engage in places where your prospects gather**. Hire someone on Upwork to create a list of them for $30 to $50. Then begin participating in all those places. Answer questions, add value, build those relationships, ask them to follow your mailing list/newsletter etc...Freely share your advice and knowledge to help build your audience.\n5. **Create and curate a list of best-in-class examples**. I'd strongly recommend becoming the leading source of 'good examples' in your industry. Everyone always wants to know who's doing something well. It doesn't really matter what medium you use - but it certainly helps if you collect email addresses. This gives you a level of portability you don\u2019t get with YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and other channels. \n6. **Create a strong website experience**. Make sure you [develop a website which will give your audience what they really need](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-develop-a-better-website-for). Post your best content on it. Make sure it includes case studies and testimonials. Make it a place for people to visit and explore your philosophy and successes.\n7. **Learn how to sell consultancy services**. Read some of the top sales blogs out there and [develop a process from taking an interested lead into a client](https://richardmillington.substack.com/p/how-to-sell-consultancy-services). Learn how to guide leads to what they should be doing and how to fill the gap for them. \n8. **Know what should be in a consultancy contract**.

I\u2019m going to try to frame out why and provide recommendations for you. \n\nWhy they may hesitate to staff someone who is ND:\n1) Individual bias\n2) Corporate bias - D&I initiatives may be a facade \n3) New hires are always a risk, and they\u2019ve chalked this into an increased risk bucket\n4) Consulting is a client service business and some of the challenges of ND folks make it harder to succeed in that set-up\n5) They are honestly trying to match you to the best project based on the supports you asked for and it hasn\u2019t come up yet. \n\nIt also just might be that there isn\u2019t enough work. \n\nNote that these are a mix of bad and good reasons.  For your immediate best path it probably doesn\u2019t matter which is why. Longer term it might - if it\u2019s bias driven you may never be able to change that false impression of lack of capability. \n\nSo what do you do. I would sidestep the issue, unless they force you to address it. I would keep doing great work. I would explicitly ask for project work. I would ask for feedback on the work you are doing. You want to make it clear that staffing you on a project will be a win for that project. If you get answers about project availability, I would acknowledge that and then ask what you can do? Can you help with more client development. Is there anything you can focus on learning to set yourself up for success? Generally give off the vibe of someone who is ready and capable of more. \n\nIn the future, I think you can accomplish almost all of the goals of disclosing your neurodiversity without actually making the disclosure. Frame it as \u201cthings that help me work best\u201d.  Many companies use things like Myers Briggs which mostly just facilitate conversations about working styles. So you can come across as just really self aware if you raise certain things. \u201cI tend to get really focused on getting all the details, so I may ask you explicitly how long you want me to work on things.\u201d \u201cI tend to do best with clear plans, is it OK if I take some time to lay this out and make sure I\u2019m not missing anything.\u201d  As you build relationships you can make more pointed disclosures \u201cHey, I\u2019m feeling a bit overwhelmed, just so you know I\u2019ve learned my failure mode is to put my head down and try to do everything when I have to much.  If you see me doing that I\u2019d appreciate the heads up, I may need help thinking through prioritization.\u201d  Start small and build up to more \u201crisky\u201d disclosures once you\u2019ve built up a relationship and a well of goodwill.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1684206173, "created_utc": 1684206173, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jkbk5iw", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_13fi3sb", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jkbk5iw", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_13fi3sb", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/13fi3sb/im_concerned_that_my_manager_isnt_staffing_me_on/jkbk5iw/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1687818475, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service recommendation", "_search_bucket": "competitor_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust"], "_date": "2023-05-16"}

This sub is primarily focused on consultants who work for large, established firms such as McKinsey or Deloitte. Most people at these firms joined through established recruiting pipelines at an undergraduate or graduate level school. It is possible to join these firms from industry, but the path in is a bit less clear. \n\nAnd then there are tons of other, smaller more niche consulting firms that deliver a wide variety of services.

This freed them up to focus on casework while ensuring every lead gets proper attention. Some used services like Ruby Receptionist initially before hiring in-house.\n\nOne thing to consider: if your phone is already ringing consistently, that's great, but make sure you're capturing leads when you're in court or meetings. PI and criminal cases are often time-sensitive, and people will call the next attorney on their list if they can't reach you.\n\nAlso, since you mentioned you have good connections - are you tracking which referral sources are sending the highest-value cases? Might be worth investing more in whatever's working best to keep that pipeline strong as you scale.\n\nThe intake person is probably the right first hire though.

Just a quick note upfront - I'm with LEX Reception, but I promise to keep this purely informational.  \n  \nWhen evaluating answering services, here are a few things to consider, no matter which provider you choose:  \n  \nLegal-Specific Intake - The person answering your calls should be familiar with legal terminology and processes to ensure smooth communication with your clients.  \n  \nReal People - Check if the service provides real people or AI receptionist. I'm biased on this one because we truly believe a real person answering a call provides a better first impression than AI (we have data to prove it!).  \n  \nIntegrations That Work For You - Look for services that allow direct scheduling. This eliminates frustrating back-and-forth - securing a higher commitment from the potential new client. Integration with your CRM or case management system also cuts down on admin.  \n  \nOverflow and Routing - The provider should offer flexible routing options and help you with best practices that align with your firm's protocols. Check that they make it easy to toggle availability as your schedule changes between meetings or deep focus work. \u00a0  \n  \nTone Consistency- Callers should always feel like they\u2019re speaking to your practice. The answering service should provide a custom script to maintain consistency and offer expertise in helping to craft it.  \n  \nHope that helps!

The day law firms start measuring the value return of a product or service is the day Harvey goes bankrupt. \n\nThere's even a unofficial saying among legal tech founders that once you win a single law firm, you can almost win all others.

Litigation isn\u2019t about neatly reading one document front to back, it is about dealing with bundles of pleadings, witness statements, precedents and years of correspondence. No LLM can realistically just read everything without retrieval. Even with big context windows you are not fitting an entire disclosure set or case history in one go.\n\n\n\n\"Vectors pretending to be understanding\" misses the point. Embeddings are what make semantic search work. That is what lets you find termination when the document says rescission or employment agreement when it says service contract. It is not a trick, it is how you avoid brittle keyword matching. Modern stacks use hybrid approaches that combine dense and sparse retrieval with rerankers to make results far more reliable than the strawman you are criticising.\n\n\n\nThe blindfold analogy is back to front. RAG is what grounds the model in the actual record. If your system brings back different results each time and misses key passages then your pipeline is badly engineered. Fixed chunking, consistent top-k, rerankers and audit trails are all standard ways to make retrieval stable and repeatable.\n\n\n\nThe idea that an LLM can \"just read the text directly\" also does not hold up. Context windows have limits. Even at 1,000,000 tokens you cannot brute force a litigation dataset. Without retrieval the model has no way of knowing what matters and what does not.\n\n\n\nOn the point about waiting a few hours for an answer, that is not how litigation teams work. They need iterative passes: first a chronology, then cross-checking witness statements, then building out issue lists.

There are massive cultural differences. People in India selling services for that much are hiring native English speaking people to handle accounts.  The market you want to be in isn\u2019t something l, realistically, that someone from India is going total into and run away with your goals in 18 months.   If a company is looking specifically for Indian talent in America they are trying to pay 15-30 per hour.   If you are white labeling and working for other agencies, this might get to 45 per hour \u2014 once you start charging above that the amount of competition that have American tech company resumes your value per dollar starts to get priced out unless you are able to be super niche or have an out of this world value prop.      \n\nYou\u2019d have to get really lucky and land that one client that opens all these doors for you to hit this dude.

GHL dudes will cold-call all day until the wheels fall off. You can find them on YouTube. They are grinders, and I love/hate them. They all sell courses and the GHL software. \n\n3. Cold email. You can scale if it's suitable and customized, and you do follow-ups. Costs and takes effort. \n\nLastly, they do so many demos that they can sell gas to a Tesla owner. They put the reps in, hear objections, and answer them masterfully. \n\nAlso, prodpects see their calendar, and they get FOMO. They have testimonials and social proof cuz their schedule is packed.

And onboarding can be tricky, like others here have already said.\n\nAdd to that that a win is not always the same as work and revenue right away, and you see why this isn't for everyone: The first step for us is often the signing of a \"master services agreement,\" which comes with a hypothetical budget; said budget is then only released when the client accepts a specific project within said MSA (which usually happens, but is not always guaranteed; again: we're not exactly an agency, so your experience might differ). \n\nBut then: these projects tend to be \"big ticket,\", and the long sales cycle and ramp-up are compensated by very streamlined \"downstream\" processes. Plus, these guys always pay on time and in full. Oh, and we find client retention and development much easier with the \"bigger fish...\" \n\nBut this last bit might be subjective.\n\nOverall, I think there's no wrong or right answer when it comes to the \"enterprise yes or no\" question, but in my experience it's easiest to focus on one segment explicitly (so: enterprise OR SMB), since bizdev is so different between the two... I guess there are folks who can run two very different sales processes and cycles simultaneously - I certainly cannot.\n\nFinal thought:\n\nWinning enterprise clients can be significantly more complex and costly than winning SMBs, and often there's more risk (we took a big cash flow hit when lining up a big contract with a Fortune \"200\" 2 years ago, with significant biz dev cost and prolonged negotiations resulting in a situation where the account ran \"in the red\" for nine month)... But I do find they're easier to service. \n\nOh, and: the fact that they're a bit more difficult to bring in seems to make it so there's less competition for their business? ('s how it feels to me, at least... We rarely pitch, and if we do, we rarely see firms of our size [3.5 FTE] in the roster)...\n\nDid I answer the question?", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1724784047, "created_utc": 1724784047, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "lk7tfge", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1f22snp", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_lk7tfge", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1f22snp", "permalink": "/r/agency/comments/1f22snp/has_anyone_serviced_a_fortune_500_or_a_large/lk7tfge/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1724784067, "saved": false, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "agency", "subreddit_id": "t5_2s7sx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/agency", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 2, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service cost", "_search_bucket": "pricing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["blocker_trust", "pricing"], "_date": "2024-08-27"}

Personally it reads like you insinuate they don't know or aren't good at what they're doing and you can help them. Instead of a framing like that maybe go with a value proposition like \"I love your podcast and want to help you grow it and find more of your people\" your proposition is basically the same, get more \"customers/listeners\" but fring it in an enthusiastic way to frame it as you will be working together on a team towards this common goal you both want vs starting from a negative framing of \"you're not doing these things right, do better.\" I'm being a little hyperbolic on the framing but you need to be, people are going to spend 5-10 seconds deciding whether to read or delete your email so assume your tone is dialed to 11 for the decision maker as a framing exercise.\n\nAlso, and this is for anyone here, do not send these emails out from any free email account. Get yourself a domain and a real email address or no business of substance will take you seriously or respond back and the ones that do are likely to be desperate or discount/value shoppers. Domains are cheap and you can use free zoho email if you can't pay for Microsoft 364 or GSuite Email license.\n\nAgency business, like most B2B (Business to Business) services and products lives on repeat business.

A well thought out LinkedIn profile actually went much further for me.\n\nI also got my own domain, but again I don't think it brought much value.\n\nI spent way too much time trying to showcase a portfolio of services that I wanted to provide, but it was very difficult to sell (I suck as a salesperson). I had to decide whether I wanted to stick to my guns and continue to only sell the services that I wanted to do or to suck it up and do what I did as an employee (what clients were demanding and were willing to pay for): solving complex post M&A and other critical business issues.\n\nI decided then that the most important thing was to land that first client to get the cash flow going, this took about 2-3 months. After that, I was so busy doing work for the client that I didn't have time to scout for more clients, so I focused on building up a network of recruiters, interim placement firms, consulting brokerages/middlemen and larger consulting firms looking for specialist competence that they didn't have inhouse (but I did).\n\nThe first client was the toughest to land but then it got easier and easier as more and more opportunities came from my network, making it easier to jack up the hourly/daily rate.\n\nSo for me, I couldn't really change the market demand to hire me for what I wanted to do. Instead the market was willing to financially compensate me very well for something I was already good at (but didn't really enjoy or find challenging).\n\nSo I decided the better choice for me was to accept financial compensation sacrificing job satisfaction for 10 years and then retire early from \"corporate life\". \"", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1714467803, "created_utc": 1714467803, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "l1wxks2", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1cg84eo", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_l1wxks2", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1cg84eo", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1cg84eo/starting_business_as_a_it_cloud_and_security/l1wxks2/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1714467820, "saved": false, "score": 3, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 3, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "answering service cost", "_search_bucket": "pricing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["pricing"], "_date": "2024-04-30"}

Your continued employment with the organization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, as the result of a multi-constraint zero-input analytical process where the only guiding principle is: \"What does this salary contribute toward **future** exit valuation\".\n\nThis is where you start to see the dizzying complexity of this space. For example, as the SVP of Transformation your value is \"person who makes getting value creation programs implemented more likely, because they have the trust of the CEO, board, and relevant stakeholders.\" Selection process is: \"best person that we can find who meets those criteria right now at an affordable price...\" You and your team will cost around $15 MM in exit valuation ($1 MM budget, 12 multiple, $3 MM equity award) which they are going to want to see 10 X return on ($150 MM increase in valuation).\n\nThat's the math when they make their offer, at least....\n\nThe following day....\n\n* Due to our factory burning down on national news, the board has decided to make a strategic pivot away from being a CPG company to a strict B2B focus. Given the depth of these changes, you will appreciate that our transformation leader should come from a B2B background. These HR people are here to help.\n* The CEO is a raving asshole, we're replacing him. Roll D6 to determine your fit with the new executive, who is likely heralding a broader change in culture...\n* We just paid too much for a company owned by a buddy of the Chairman and installed that douche on the board since they're now a minority shareholder... He's old school - he has his inner circle, who have been with him for 20 years. Everyone else is his personal bitch (especially if they don't have $50MM in the bank). He pulls the strings and you dance, like the Puppet that you are.... Speak up, Bitch! ([https://youtu.be/a\\_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm](https://youtu.be/a_qalQCrBn0?si=ZM6UqfXdChEFcflm)).  (oh dear god, this one was fucking painful while it lasted)\n* We have the opportunity to acquire Company X; as a condition of doing a deal, which will double our sales and quadruple our valuation, we need to find their Chief Strategy Officer a job. Fortunately we have a solution to this challenge...\n* The Manager Partner has decided to install one of their former proteges, who has a MASSIVE cocaine habit, as your new \"Strategic Advisor\". Roll 2D10 to determine what is going to come out of his mouth into the Managing Partner's ear.  You can attempt a saving throw against penalties based on your personal prestige score.\n* Our Chief Strategy Officer screwed up and offered someone a job at the wrong career band, resulting in them qualifying for equity. To avoid the embarrassment of admitting this mistake to their CEO & board (and likely being fired), they need to reorganize their group to justify a new senior position based on cost savings. Fortunately, we have identified an executive role to eliminate to justify this...\n\nBy the way, all of this shit happened to me or people I know. There are no rules, this is not a just universe, everything is random. Nihilism is psychologically healthy here..\n\nSo what are the upsides here?\n\n* No Golden Handcuffs - Nature of the incentives leaves you free to shop at any time, often with substantial rewards - especially once you show you can deliver in private equity sponsored environments. I've repriced my comp multiple times.\n* Social efficiency - Relative to a Fortune 500 role, you can invest zero energy into politics and positioning. Your next promotion or big raise will come from outside the organization, so focus on building external networks and industry presence. This actually has multiple implications: a) in the long run, political collaboration always beats competition in this space (we're connected & refer each other), b) can free up 30% - 70% of your time from meaningless pitch work, and c) you're investing political capital in relationships you can bring to future opportunities.\n* Build Implementation Efficiency - Unlike larger organizations, nobody will care about which tools & techniques you select. Pick your favorites and double down on them, building a depth of expertise in your core area which will  a) increase your impact in your current role and b) builds momentum for a side business.\n* Minimal restrictions - As long as you fulfill your designated role and don't steal from the company, your leadership will usually embrace a \"don't ask, don't tell\" approach to side businesses and intellectual property. I've openly run multiple side businesses as a portfolio company executive with minimal repercussions. Fortune 500 Human Resources teams would stroke-out if I did a full disclosure.\n* Opportunity to Grab Pieces When They Hit The Floor - I'll admit to having run a model or two contemplating an offer on non-strategic parts of the business or launching a re-mix of a dying product or service concept....

( I.e. graduated from a western university.) is that accurate?\n\nYes.  We are affected by client wishes, contracts, cost benefit, and heavily by market rates.  My Lao consultants with AUS undergrad degrees and 8-10 years of experience are making about $45 - $50k a year, which is high for the local professional services market.  My Lao consultant with a US degree and ADB experience is making about $62k.  My US folks are $200k+\n\nHowever, we only have ONE US long-termer who is the face of our project.  I honestly wanted to get rid of him and go all short-termers for international experts but the client refused, they want a foreign, non SE Asian face full-time, even if its not as effective.  \n\n>In addition, could projects like these implemented by westerners perpetuate perceptions that only Europeans are competent administrators/policy makers ( rather than locals)?\n\nThis is an issue that depends on the country. In Laos, they want an expat face (Skin color doesn't matter as long as they are from a Western country and exude it) to help drive decisions and to be able to take the blame when shit goes wrong.  Its not just developing countries that had this but advanced nations like Korea that wanted a non-regional voice that could express NO and pushback but could also be the catalyst to finally make a freaking decision.  No one wants to be the nail that sticks out because no one wants to get hammered down - the expat is suppose to take this role and responsibility.  Expats can be more \"expendable\" - I can fire and replace them easily.  Guess who I can't replace easily- my local consultants who went to western schools.  Why?  Their father is the vice minister of X or their uncle is the Governor of Y or... basically in a small community, these people are connected.\n\nIs it still heavily Western based?  Yes, especially if you add all ethnicities and throw in HKG, Korea, Japan, Singapore, maybe even Malaysia and middle income kingdoms into the mix.  My clients in Bangladesh love me some MENA consultants who can play consultants on TV.  I can take South Asians to TImor-LEste to help build their port.  Former Petro experts from Kazahkstan to Indonesia?  No problem.  \n\nBasically, the best consultants I can sell are those who have designed and implemented successful solutions in many different countries and situations before and can walk everyone through lessons learned and a strategy/vision that is based on actual wins and losses.  \n\nDoes this help answer?  Of course there are issues with race sometimes but it also seems rooted in nationality.  I'd have a very difficult time fielding a qualified West AFrican consultant for some clients in Ukraine but an African American?  No problem.

Costs are estimated by service line, then looked at overall in a deal review (by service line and firm leadership) \n\n7. After proposal is submitted, client will down-select a few vendors to participate in orals. Each service line will provide representation. An orals deck will be compiled and dress rehearsals with all presenters \n\n8. If team wins, a statement of work will be drafted, with each service line drafting its portion, and going through all necessary approvals with firm leadership, finance, legal, client review, etc. and there will be next steps to contract, staff, onboard, which is where it hands off from the sales team to the delivery team \n\nProposals are weird. You can do a little work on a proposal with high dollar value, win it, and your sales numbers look great. Or a lot of work on a bunch of little proposals, or non-winning proposals, that yields the same or lesser outcome. Start wherever they\u2019ll let you to get your foot in the door and learn. Stick on the daily calls. Observe. Help where you can. I personally love it when the juniors on my team cover the daily call as representatives for our service line. Save me 30 min of my day, they learn, they bring back updates, and if they are asked something and do not know the answer, they can take it as an action to find out or ping me to join- it\u2019s all internal so it\u2019s ok to not have all the answers.

If this is the one in Vegas, I actually think you might be on to something. \n\nI mean, 195 solid 5 star reviews of Casey Xavier as an *attorney* generally, but from my review they don't read like actual client reviews and there are no case details, extremely generic. They read more like 'friends' or colleagues. Generic praise for the attorney and/or experience 'working with them' which can be anything. And zero reviews on yelp at the same time.

PI is one of those fields of law where a lot of staff can be helpful, whereas my firm has 3 attorneys and no staff (a full-time receptionist is next though, it's too much). Case mills tend to underpay people and churn through staff like crazy and cheap out whenever possible. \n\nAs to the offshoring work, it's actually pretty common for stuff like calling for medical records requests and formulaic, admin HIPAA stuff. I've only seen the bigger case mills do it, and it's not really a great sign that the firm cares about your case specifically IMO, but that sort of work doesn't really need to be highly skilled either.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1707256850, "created_utc": 1707256850, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": 1707257087, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "kp8ppjw", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1akkywf", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_kp8ppjw", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t3_1akkywf", "permalink": "/r/LawFirm/comments/1akkywf/xavier_injury_law_beware_of_shady_law_firms_and/kp8ppjw/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1707256865, "saved": false, "score": 15, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "LawFirm", "subreddit_id": "t5_2thsj", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/LawFirm", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 15, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "how much receptionist", "_search_bucket": "pricing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-02-06"}

Outlook and Gmail are both solid options, but Outlook might give a more formal feel.  \nBoth are reputable choices, but it depends on your specific needs. Take advantage of free trials to see which aligns better with your workflow.  \nAbsolutely crucial. Shop around, get quotes, and find a provider that understands the unique needs of your practice area.  \nWordPress offers more flexibility, but GoDaddy can be simpler for beginners. It boils down to how much customization you want.  \nSmart moves! Consult with a lawyer to ensure you cover all legal bases and protect your interests.  \nI haven't personally used one, but many firms find them incredibly helpful for handling calls professionally without the need for a full-time receptionist. Look for one with good reviews and features that suit your needs.  \nBest of luck with everything \u2013 from signing the lease to the renovations and beyond!

(Important to note, the guy attorneys have dressed in blue jeans and t-shirts \ud83d\ude43 There are no female attorneys on staff).\n\nYeah this is super sexist. The men wear tshirts and the women have to wear blazers and heels? Wtf?? Very unsurprising that there's no female lawyers at this firm, your firm prob wouldn't hire them, only hires women to be support staff, and potentially wouldn't hire them as staff unless they're young and conventionally attractive. A lot of male bosses like hiring women to be staff but not lawyers cuz they feel female staff are less likely to ask for raises and more likely to be Your firm is sexist AF and could potentially get in trouble for gender discrimination.\n\n> Most of the support staff is young girls in our 20s (myself included). Most of us have only started working there in the past two years, majority within this year. I have heard rumors of a mass quitting of Case Managers but don\u2019t know anything beyond that.\n\nAaaaand I was right. Definitely a super sexist firm. The whole reason the other staff haven't been there that long is cuz everyone else quit. \n\n> very few coworkers really had any positive reviews of their experience.\n\nHow unsurprising lol.\n\n> the one time I briefly used my phone to decline my father's call and texted him that I was busy (took like 30s if I am being generous) I received a \"gentle\" reminder from the HR rep training me to stop using my phone. Again, I was on it for barely a couple seconds to decline a phone call. Another one of the receptionists up front was told to never wear her Apple Watch to work.\n\nYour bosses are fucking crazy. That's not normal at all. Don't be goofing off at your desk, but you did nothing wrong. If you can't even wear an apple watch to work that's crazy. It's like your firm has a really obvious pattern of controlling what their female employees wear...oh wait\n\n> There are cameras everywhere. Most of the supervisors (HR, head attorneys) have a bunch of tv screens in their office overlooking the rest of the staff's desks like a mall security guard.\n\nThe rampant sexism was already egregious, but this is the creepiest part. Security cameras are one thing, but those should be pointing towards doors and windows- not your employees. Many states have laws specifically banning this kind of stuff. How big is this firm? The smaller it is, the creepier it is. Even if it's big this is still insane. Orwell & Orwell is clearly a nightmare to work for. These psychos def spend a lot of time using their cameras to perv on their female staff. Make sure there's no cameras in the bathrooms, a place this vile would totally do something like that. Guarantee your bosses spend more time being creepy than actually working.\n\n> the attorney who the firm is named after does not do any legal work\n\nYep, I was right again. I've lost track of the red flags at this point.\n\n> he calls himself something like \"Chief Value/Vision Officer\", which is essentially a very watered-down Tim Robbins. And, instead of calling the employees upfront \"receptionists\" or even \"legal intake specialists\" or something to that effect, we refer to them as \"ambassadors\"(?). (This may just be the hater in me to think this is weird so would appreciate a third opinion).\n\nJesus christ. Your boss is the type of person that was in business school in college or wants to feel like he's some kind of Jeff Bezos. He's a power-tripping lunatic. Calling staff \"ambassadors\" is just weird. If you don't want to call them secretaries cuz that word has kind of a sexist/demeaning vibe then ok, but ambassadors...nah this is bizarre. Your boss calling himself the \"chief vision officer\" while literally perving on his staff with his NASA screens is uncomfortably on the nose. You're not a hater at all, this firm is nuts. \n\n> Discussing pay is not allowed. I thought this was illegal, but am hearing mixed things. Is this typical? No other job I had had has done this. I am in Texas.\n\nNot an employment lawyer and I'm not giving you legal advice, but there's a 90% chance this is illegal. Even if it's legal (cuz Texas is prob awful for employee rights) it's still incredibly predatory. \n\n> instead of saying \"we are family!\" (which is a red flag in it of itself), they call us a 'clan/tribe'.\n\nBruh.

Phones can be had for $50-100 easily depending mostly on how many buttons you want them to have and how fancy of a screen it has.  More buttons are important for receptionists and people who will be transferring a lot, but irrelevant for most users who just need an extension.  Big screens are the same, only people who manage a lot of calls or executives who insist on the fancy phone because it looks cool.  I mean sure, you can find massive screened video phones with built in (horrifically outdated and never updated) Android tablets, but you definitely do not need those (nor should you want them IMO).\n\nPhones are cheap, and the best part of standards-based VoIP is that you can mix and match.  I have sites with Aastra/Mitel, Cisco, Engenius, Grandstream, and Yealink gear all working together with no effort.\n\nAnother thing it sounds like you might need to wrap your head around is the fact that lines don't exist.  There is no such thing as \"line 1\" in VoIP.  You have DIDs (phone numbers) and you have extensions. Each DID can be routed to whatever call flow you want, be it a direct number for a single extension, a ring group of dozens of phones, an IVR menu, etc. and each extension can call out sending whatever caller ID the system wants to send.  There are no real technical limits on how many calls can be going at once, a modern internet connection can handle hundreds or thousands and even the crappiest PBX hardware can pass hundreds of calls.\n\nUsually a service provider will limit your simultaneous calls with \"unlimited\" calling plans but if you're on a metered plan it's usually wide open make as many calls as you want.\n\nIt sounds like what you need is three DIDs (main number, the direct line, and the fax), 10 phone extensions, and maybe one fax extension if you insist on keeping a physical fax machine.\n\nIf you can get buy-in on using e-fax instead of a real machine you're likely to have a much easier time, fax adapters work fine most of the time but fax machines are horribly picky and terrible to diagnose so when anything goes wrong you're left having to prove it's not the VoIP line every time which sucks.  E-fax is so much better, your users interact with it as email and it only goes to fax when it's heading off to whatever outdated idiot you're dealing with who insists on a fax.\n\nIf your users actually want fax or want \"Line 1/2/3\" on every single phone you're going to have a bad time unless you can convince them to leave the '90s behind.", "can_gild": true, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1690065482, "created_utc": 1690065482, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "jt1xaqv", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_156t9za", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_jt1xaqv", "no_follow": false, "num_reports": 0, "parent_id": "t1_jt1isab", "permalink": "/r/VOIP/comments/156t9za/current_panasonic_pbx_going_to_voip/jt1xaqv/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": [], "retrieved_on": 1690065499, "saved": false, "score": 6, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "VOIP", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qrz4", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/VOIP", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 6, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "how much receptionist", "_search_bucket": "pricing", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["churn_billing", "churn_general", "pricing"], "_date": "2023-07-22"}

Way better than hiring cold and hoping they\u2019re not weird.\n\n3. Billing gap + admin time: Yeah that 60 hours a week with only ~25 billable is brutal, but painfully relatable. Intake and admin can eat your life. Have you looked at virtual receptionists or intake services that plug into Clio Grow? Even if it\u2019s a few hundred bucks a month, freeing up your time might pay for itself fast.\n\n4. Thumbtack... ehh. I\u2019ve heard super mixed things and your numbers kinda confirm it.

It's tough when you're trying to shop for something with one hand tied behind your back.\n\n\n\nThe tools you mentioned are all solid but for very different use cases. Notion is a super flexible canvas but can become the wild west without strict governance, which might be an issue for compliance docs. Guru is great for quick, card-based knowledge for internal teams. The legal angle usually points towards systems with rock-solid version control and audit trails, which is probably what's steering the conversation.\n\n\n\nThe trickiest part of your list is the AI that automatically tracks federal policy updates. That's usually a separate, specialized service (like a legal tech or compliance intelligence tool) rather than a built-in feature of a general KMS.\n\n\n\na different way to think about this problem might be to separate the \\*storage\\* of knowledge from the \\*access\\* to it. Full disclosure, I work at a company called eesel AI, and this is the kind of problem we help with. Instead of a massive migration project to one new system, you can plug an AI into whatever sources you end up using (even your existing Confluence, SharePoint, Google Docs, etc.).\n\n\n\nWe see companies in regulated spaces, like Covergo in insurance tech, use an AI assistant right inside MS Teams. It lets their employees ask questions like \"what's our approved language for X policy?\" and get instant answers sourced from all their compliance docs at once, without having to hunt through folders. It has Salesforce and Teams integrations like you're looking for.\n\n\n\nThis approach doesn't solve the 'auto-flagging of new legislation' part directly, but it makes finding the \\*impact\\* of that legislation across your dozens (or hundreds) of documents a matter of seconds.

Furthermore, it will transcribe the call, pull out key details (that we've prompted it to), send those details to a platform (that we've built) update information and then use the information from the call to update the platform CRM the lead came from automatically.\n\n  \nThat last one is kind of unique. There's are multiple platforms we use for our clients where they get leads from and actually answering all calls and updating the leads in the CRM that's provided is a quantity/cost factor in your leads.

In one Google Sheet column, they write why they think they are over/underspending and why they are over tCPA and in the next column, they write what they are going to do / plan to do. We're exploring how we can use AI to take data from those two columns and for each client, email me/the account manager an email summary intended for the client that the account manager signs off on and sends to the client.\n\n  \nSometimes clients log into their ad account and see things aren't great but aren't aware what we're doing to change things. This helps with that communication. They don't necessarily need better results, they just want more communication. So this is to help with that.\n\n  \n \\- Finally, it's kind of a long shot, but on the 3rd of every month our clients get their automated reports from Agency Analytics. I'd like to be able to summarize the reports via AI and send them that email from me. But the problem is that reporting and marketing is so subjective.

There's no such thing as \"saturated\" at least I don't believe. Yeah, there are lots of devs already providing web development services, so what?  there's nothing to do with competition if you know what to do exactly.    \n\n\nFirst of all, mark my word its very hard and demands a lot of works. If you have huge budgets then ok you can burn your $$$ on paid ads and get leads instantly.  For that you should hire the PPC experts (true expert).  I know you're not looking for this answer.   \n\n\nYou're looking for something that works well and you can get lead,clients regular basis with minimum effort and can run your business smoothly.    \n\n\nThere's the answer:    \n\n\n1. Cold email.  Its a very time-consuming and you have to send tons of emails to get some quality response.  Its boring and Im not doing it. As Im a massive reader, so I can confirm by reading others that cold emailing still works.   \n\n2. Networking:  This is what Im doing and getting leads and even I made over $350k and my business now making $100k+ per year.  So, this is proven and I'm telling you from my personal experience.   Its pretty straightforward.  Just pick a niche/industry (pick an industry based on how well you know and passionate about the industry), then start connecting to the business owners every single day.   Find the way to talk to them. Join related communities, ask them questions and answer their questions.  The goal is to be well-known and trusted in the community (at least in your connections).  Well,  it could be facebook, LinkedIn, twitter, Instagram or whatever. first analyze your target people, whats the best platform they're actively spending time. So,   questions, answers, posts, videos, try everything to engage with them.  Lots of content.  Oh,  don't waste time by creating garbage with one click AI-generated text wall. Instead, read a lot about the industry, read a lot about their problems, even find the problems on groups, quora, reddit, even on google suggestions.  Then craft your content with informative information and post it.   So,   post content by adding value, ask questions that trigger them to reply, create conversations.   Dont try to sell anything directly with your posts.  When you become a trusted in some of your connections, believe me they will come to you and offer you their projects.  You know all the agency/company owner has lots of projects and they really need someone reliable and confident.  If you read some sales book or at least research online you will know that its taking a lot of time to take buying decisions. Then how can you expect someone to buy service instantly when you both just started conversations?  Im practicing this and I'm getting lots of leads,clients without any problem and this is very genuine way t generate clients.     \n\n\nlet me know if you have any questions.

The Limits of AI in Complex Human Problems\n\n* **AI Can\u2019t Fully Replace Human Judgment**: While AI excels at analyzing data and automating processes, management consulting often involves nuanced human problems like organizational change, leadership dynamics, and corporate culture. These areas require emotional intelligence, creativity, and interpersonal skills that AI can\u2019t replicate.\n* **Custom, Non-Standard Work**: Many consulting engagements are bespoke and require deep context, industry knowledge, and problem-solving that is unique to each client. AI may assist but cannot fully automate such tasks.\n\n# 2. The Role of Partners Isn\u2019t Just Oversight\n\n* **Client Relationships**: Partners are often the face of the firm, building trust and long-term relationships with C-suite executives. This relationship-based aspect of consulting remains hard to automate.\n* **Strategic Thinking**: Partners often lead high-level strategy work, which involves envisioning future scenarios, aligning diverse stakeholders, and facilitating decision-making. AI can provide insights, but the decision-making process requires human synthesis and judgment.\n* **Sales and Business Development**: Partners drive revenue by selling work, leveraging networks, and understanding client needs\u2014areas where human touch is still paramount.\n\n# 3. ERP and IT Transformation Aren\u2019t Going Away\n\n* **Complexity Will Persist**: Even if AI enhances efficiency, large-scale ERP implementations will still require significant human oversight and expertise. Customizing and integrating systems across complex, global organizations isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all process.\n* **AI Adoption Itself Requires Consulting**: Many firms are still struggling to implement AI and automation technologies. Consultants will play a key role in guiding organizations through these transformations, even if the tools themselves evolve.\n\n# 4. Demand for Consulting Is Likely to Grow Overall\n\n* **New Opportunities Created by AI**: AI will disrupt industries, creating new challenges and opportunities for clients. This will likely drive demand for consulting to help organizations navigate disruption, adapt to new business models, and implement AI-driven strategies.\n* **Geopolitical and Economic Complexity**: Global volatility (e.g., supply chain disruptions, regulatory changes, ESG pressures) ensures that companies will continue seeking external expertise to navigate uncertainty.\n\n# 5. AI Will Augment, Not Replace\n\n* **Improved Productivity**: AI could enhance the efficiency of consulting firms without eliminating roles altogether. For example, it might enable analysts and consultants to focus on higher-value tasks rather than being entirely replaced.\n* **Hybrid Consulting Models**: The future may see a blend of AI-powered solutions and human advisory services. Partners who embrace AI and integrate it into their offerings could remain highly relevant.\n\n# 6. Resistance to Change and Trust in Human Expertise\n\n* **Client Resistance**: Many clients may still prefer human advisors over relying entirely on AI, especially for high-stakes or strategic decisions.\n* **Trust and Accountability**: In critical situations, clients value accountability. AI might provide answers, but ultimately, clients want someone who will take responsibility for the outcomes\u2014and that\u2019s where consultants and Partners come in.\n\n# 7. The Leverage Model May Evolve, Not Collapse\n\n* **Reshaping Rather Than Dismantling**: While the pyramid structure might shrink, it won\u2019t necessarily disappear. Firms might rely on smaller, more agile teams that use AI to enhance productivity, rather than fully abandoning the leverage model.\n* **Higher-Skilled Talent**: The focus may shift toward hiring fewer but more highly skilled consultants who can work effectively with AI, creating a \u201cdiamond\u201d structure instead of a traditional pyramid.\n\n# 8. Consulting Firms Have Proven Resilient\n\n* **Historical Adaptability**: Consulting firms have weathered many disruptions before (e.g., globalization, outsourcing, the rise of digital). Their ability to adapt and evolve shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.\n* **Investments in AI**: Most leading firms are already heavily investing in AI and automation, integrating these technologies into their offerings to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWhile the disruption AI brings to consulting is real and significant, the industry is unlikely to disappear or shrink dramatically. Instead, it will evolve, with firms adapting their structures, offerings, and roles to remain competitive. The role of Partners, though potentially reduced in volume, will still be critical\u2014perhaps shifting more toward innovation, relationship management, and thought leadership.", "can_gild": false, "can_mod_post": false, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created": 1734927430, "created_utc": 1734927430, "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "m3e365f", "is_submitter": false, "likes": null, "link_id": "t3_1hkejr4", "locked": false, "mod_note": null, "mod_reason_by": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t1_m3e365f", "no_follow": true, "num_reports": null, "parent_id": "t3_1hkejr4", "permalink": "/r/consulting/comments/1hkejr4/the_downfall_of_consulting_partners/m3e365f/", "removal_reason": null, "replies": "", "report_reasons": null, "retrieved_on": 1734927449, "saved": false, "score": 8, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "consulting", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r121", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/consulting", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null, "ups": 8, "user_reports": [], "_search_query": "AI answering service problem", "_search_bucket": "ai_native_experience", "_competitors": [], "_insight_buckets": ["general"], "_date": "2024-12-23"}
