*Answering service agents don't follow scripts, have a quality ceiling, and lack business knowledge; recommends a dedicated remote receptionist over any agency for better outcomes.*

> I've used conversational answering service for years. It's much better than when I started with nobody but they do have a ceiling. This service does not follow a script. They will do bookings for you but combined with them not following a script it makes quality control on the bookings difficult as they are operating without solid guardrails of what your criteria are. If you can afford it, get a full time remote receptionist that will know more about your business than any agency ever will.

*Previous call center constantly said 'we can't do that'; PATLive offered customization for call handling including scheduling, forwarding, spam marking, and CRM lead entry*

> I just wanted to share my experience with PATLive after finding them in the App Marketplace for Jobber. I gave them a call and chatted with Jessica Pacheco about what I needed. We dove into some challenges I was facing with my old call center, and let me tell you, Jessica was super helpful! She hooked me up with an onboarding session with Amy Hearn for a 14-day free trial. Amy laid out the onboarding process for me and promised she’d be there until everything was running smoothly.  I had been with another call center for years, but Amy and Jessica had a totally different vibe when it came to meeting my business needs. My previous rep was nice, but it always felt like I was hitting a wall with, "We can't do that for your company." I was expected to just go along with their way of doing things. But with Amy and Jessica, they made it clear they had solutions for my past issues and were totally open to CUSTOMIZING how my calls were handled.  Now, PATLive answers 100% of my calls, and based on my custom setup, they can schedule, forward, mark as spam, or enter leads into my system. Plus, they’ve got this handy app that lets me monitor calls and sends me text and email alerts. If I ever have questions or concerns, Amy or any of my PATLive agents are always ready to help out! Honestly, there was no need for a 14-day trial to convince me—PATLive won me over from Day One!

**#3** | AnswerConnect | Quality: 5/5 | trustpilot

*AnswerConnect receptionists don't listen to callers, repeatedly schedule wrong time zones, and can only work off scripts without caller context, causing more work correcting errors than if calls were self-answered.*

> It didn't work as we envisioned. There were parts I loved and things that I wish worked better:  Good - The best experience with AnswerConnect was definitely Candy Oakes and her assistance to help resolve problems. She is constantly keeping in touch to make sure needed changes happen and that problems are addressed right away. If there was a way to have her answering our calls, we would probably be completely satisfied. I loved that calls were always answered quickly so that our clients never had to play phone tag or go press multiple options to get to someone.   Bad - some receptionists I really wish weren't answering our calls. They did not listen to what the caller is saying, and often scheduled the incorrect time zone repeatedly. I had to repeatedly call callers back to correct the scheduled time or other type problem. Often times I was spending way more time calling back clients than if I had answered the phone myself.  We would have kept using AnswerConnect services and worked with Candy but because the receptionists can really only work off of a script and don't have access to the caller's information, it made it difficult to get the caller to the correct person. I can see it working well for other type businesses, but can now see that it isn't a good fit for us.

*System issue erased call script causing messages to be taken as if calling an answering machine; law firm lost intake calls and escalation to management took days.*

> There was a system issue that erased our script and messages where taken as if they were calling an answering machine. We are a small law firm and each call is someone calling for help. Our script is such you would think they were in our office and they actually book consults for us. We finally caught it and was restored. There should have been a better redundancy and quality check before they upgrade anything. While I have delayed in some of my responses to customer service, initially I was all over it and asked for escalation to a manager, it would be days before I would here from them. I do not even think a manager ever emailed us. And it was different people that would respond. Something this mission critical should have escalated past a manager and to an Executive who should have followed up with us. I will say prior to that we had been very happy with AnswerConnect. The true test of any company is the urgency at which they respond when there is a problem. There was none. The old saying applies, "the problem is not the problem, how we deal with the problem is the problem"  Disappointingly,  Mike

*Agents couldn't follow simple processes like taking international phone numbers despite 7 emails; service cut without notice mid-weekend leaving business unreachable.*

> This is a TRUE feedback from a VERY disappointed & furious customer.  We were looking for a 24/7 answering services for our English customers who can be anywhere in the world. We signed with this pathetic company 10 days ago Actually writing this comment, we don't have any working phone number or chat they decided WITHOUT ANY NOTICE to cut their “service “(we are in the middle of the week end) so our potential leads cannot join us and we have to take all our weekend to find a replacement solution with anybody off.   We took time to write a complete written process to be followed by their agents, the first 3 days we had to explain them what to do, what to not do ( even the process is easy like a 10 years old boy can understand) but they didn't follow it even after several emails & checks by calling & chatting with them they didn’t.   An example of a recurrent  idiot problem ? their low IQ agents cannot take INTERNATIONAL phone number standard like +XX (country) (cause our customers can be from anywhere) we sent them several emails , 7 ones on this particular point, no changes , I had to speak with 2 of their managers for nothing, guess what , no changes they still took the phone numbers like everyone is from USA (without country code) and this is a example they didn’t follow our other processes either.  Yesterday, been so furious of their incompetence to not follow a single process like this I sent them "do your job this is pathetic" or we will leave  And then we received a 'w

*Receptionist was rude and unprofessional to a caller, resulting in a 1-star review for the law firm; possible racial bias; company refused to remove agent from rotation.*

> Hi, I have a law firm with 228 five star reviews. We use Answer Connect. Recently I received a one-star review from a potential client who stated that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. This is our first one star review ever. I went back and listened to the recording of the call. It was true that the receptionist was rude and unprofessional. Furthermore, I believe this potential client was targeted by the receptionist because of the potential callers race. The call before it by the same receptionist the same day was totally fine, but then she was rude to this different-race caller. When I brought the behavior to the attention of Answer Connect, they sympathized but they said the receptionist, Mia B. would remain in my rotation.

*Script changes require days of back-and-forth; agents follow scripts robotically without common sense; decided to bring call handling in-house despite cost.*

> It is getting frustrating They attention is good, but untimely. Changes I request take too many steps to get done. Every time I want to update the script, I have to send a chat, then someone contacts me (normally after hours), then back and forth of emails, because they never call when I ask or they don't care to send a meeting invite to have it properly scheduled. Then I have to validate the script, and then send an email back. This script form/program you use is not customer friendly and when changes are needed urgently that is just not a possibility. Your agents do follow script but I've heard calls where that is all they do, there is not attempt to make sense of the information provided and common sense is lacking most of the time.  The call volume we get is not high by any means, and I wonder how much more complaints I would get if we had more customers calling in. We have decided to move away from answer connect during 2023 and take the hit on expensing the resources ourselves just because we can't trust there will be consistency on how calls are attended.

*Scripting team couldn't understand financial business; agents were unprofessional and didn't follow scripts; 31 test calls all failed; $375 wasted.*

> We are a professional financial investments firm who was just looking for someone to answer 10-20 calls per day. AnswerConnect was very happy to work with us and took $374.99 for the first month (200 mins).   After sending the funds, we then worked with a scripter to try and get our calls into their system. Unfortunately, things started to go wrong as the gentleman was unable to grasp our business and we lost 2 weeks with completely ineffective scripts that had to be reworked. Once we finally drafted the script in full ourselves the script was as good as it could be, but then we ran into multiple call handling issues by the agents themselves who were completely unprofessional sounding, didn't always follow the script and ultimately didn't know what to do with our calls. After flagging these calls to AnswerConnect we repeatedly just got told "I've reviewed the call recording and found that the call does not meet our quality assurance expectations. Since this call does not meet our expectations, I have asked the agent to be coached on this”.  We finally reached out to our Contact who just replied: “I do realize you have been running into multiple call handling issues by our agents and see areas that cause you concern. I would hope we can still make changes to improve this, but understand if we were not a good fit for your business needs”.   We did a total of 31 TEST calls (luckily, we did not ever go live) which cost 94 mins and at this point realized that this was just not goi

*Law firm receptionists failed to follow script, gave incorrect info to leads, lost prospective clients; no response to urgent emails; cost firm revenue.*

> I must say that my experience with Ruby.com was extremely disappointing and frustrating. As a professional service provider, running a law firm specializing in Federal white collar crimes, I expected a high level of professionalism and accuracy in handling my calls. Ruby fell short on all fronts, leading to a noticeable loss of revenue for my firm.  Ruby mishandled my calls right from the start. Not only did they fail to follow the script I provided, but they also provided incorrect information to prospective leads, causing confusion and undermining the reputation of my practice. To address these urgent issues, I sent an email on July 4, 2023, detailing the problems and requesting immediate attention. I received no response from them, leaving me with no choice but to follow up with a phone call on July 6th.  Even then, getting in touch with someone from their happiness team was a challenge. I had to leave a message, stressing the urgency of the matter, but still received no call back. On July 7th, I finally spoke with someone after calling them twice the same day. We went over my service areas and provided them with a clearer, easy-to-follow script to ensure proper handling of calls. I received verbal and email assurances that the calls would be handled as requested, but it did't happen.   The very next day, they inaccurately informed a prospective lead that my firm did not handle a service that was clearly part of our offering. This error cost us the lead, as the caller's ne

*AnswerConnect agents mostly just take messages and say 'call back' instead of answering basic questions like hours and location; considering switching to another service.*

> I'll admit, not answering all the incoming calls is nice. However, more times than not the answerconnect agent just takes a message and says "call back". Even some cases where information that is given to each agent was not passed along to the incoming calling client. For instance, simple questions like what are your hours, where are you located, what time do you close. In most cases this isn't acceptable. I have enjoyed the experience of the answering service its just not delivering 100%. I will be looking into other similar services to see if its any better.

*Answering services have an inherent ceiling due to personnel turnover; nobody is as good as your own staff, but AnswerConnect is one of the better options available.*

> Nobody is as good as your own staff...so if you have to outsource to an answering service, you know it's not going to be perfect. It will get you by. If you expect more than that, you're kidding yourself. AnswerConnect is probably one of the better services available, but they're not great. They have issues directly related to personnel turnover that are pretty much unavoidable and aren't likely to change no matter how hard they care or try. Would I recommend them? Sure.

*Answering service reps lack account-specific knowledge and require constant monitoring and retraining to handle calls properly.*

> I have been using Answerconnect for a number of years now and in my honest and humble opinion I think that they could improve significantly. I think the biggest problem is not having a group of reps specifically on your account that have a little bit of understanding on what to do or how to handle callers specifically for your business. I have gone back and forth to improve the call center's response and information gathering but it's very frustrating to have to continually monitor and do that.

*Too many rotating receptionists means specific call handling instructions are frequently ignored; calls are forwarded when messages should be taken and vice versa.*

> They have a couple of really good receptionists. They can be great if you work with one or two consistently regarding your account. But having so many receptionists, with our firm having a list of specific call handling instructions, we get a lot of errors. We gets calls forwarded to the office when a message should have been taken, and we receive messages when the call should have been forwarded. The business is a great concept, but I don't recommend it unless you just need a receptionist to answer your calls and either forward ALL of them or take a message for ALL of them. They should assign a specific number of receptionists per client or have fewer employees.

*Receptionists have difficulty following call routing instructions and settings; errors persist even after multiple confirmations with support.*

> I find that the receptionists are having a difficult time following my instructions about calls to put through.  I have also had occasions where I have called the happiness dept to confirm the instructions and the settings on the app (because they didnt seem aligned) and I was told twice that it was all correct, yet the receptionists were not doing things right.  I also called the happiness dept with instructions on how to handle calls while I was on vacation, and that got messed up too, and I had to call Ruby to talk about it from my vacation in St. Thomas.  Overall I am not very impressed and for the price I pay I am going to look into other options.

> We are a small law firm with only five employees and have been using Ruby for about six months.  Our call instructions are not always followed correctly, and the mix-up of two people who have the same first name continues.  It's kind of frustrating to have to keep emailing reminders to the staff about these two issues.

*Scripts need to be extremely simple because reps lack live training on each client; only top reps can handle nuanced information gathering, and escalation support is inadequate.*

> Overall they will answer the phones and try to follow the script.  There appears to be limited live face training on each client, so your script needs to be so easy a caveman could execute on it.  In my case, I need a series of information gathering questions to be asked skillfully and in the right context in order to successfully execute and gather basic intel like name, email, and telephone.  Only the top reps can pick up on this and execite via the offline training, and the newest reps stumble and execute poorly.  Escalating for help is tough because ecveryne is "pat" and everyone is at supervisor level, who can help and change your script.

*Answering service reps regularly make errors like failing to process simple orders visible on the website; locked into service because phone number can't be ported.*

> Been using them for a couple years. Hard to switch because we have boxes , postcards, labels, website etc all with the phone number, which they won't let us buy or rent.  Their reps are usually ok, but it's also a pretty regular occasion where they have done some pretty dumb stuff. Best example is the first page of our website lists our most popular products, the first item in the list being our most popular. Next to it (and every item) is a button that says "purchase now". We've had quite a few times where customer has called in to order that item, and no order was taken and we received an email from the rep saying customers wants a CE278A but rep could not find it! Really, I asked my 10 year old to look at the front page and place an order for a CE278A and he could do it. And this has happened on more than 4 occasions. I could give many other examples, so we have been steadily removing that number from all of our material and transitioning, but will probably be another year before we can completely wean off. Do your research and find the best company.

They repeatedly assured us of all the steps they were taking to fix the problem. They were supposed to remove the spam blocker for all calls a month ago, they claim they did this, yet we are still getting most of our calls marked as spam. This has cost my business money. This is pathetic. Another good company disintegrates into mediocrity.

I've worked with them for over a year and it's been a parade of incompetence the entire time. They have wasted our ad budget, lost customers for us, and wasted hours of our time.

*Good onboarding but implementation failed; had to triple-check all work; agents lacked critical thinking and made copy-paste errors; $600/month to review their work.*

> UPDATE to 1 Start: Smith.si response's is a material misrepresentation of what transpired. My experience was after they answered calls for just 4 days. No way I was willing to stick around to help this business resolve its customer services challenges and coachable opportunities as they put it. Not on my dime. If you have that $600/month to spend to review another company's work, then by all means this is the service for you.   To be fair, I did have a phenomenal onboarding experience which fell short after implementation.   At no time did I say I was too busy to approve revisions and in fact made many through your portal by myself. Your rep did acknowledge her mistake of not including the signature line when "copying and pasting" the sample follow-up message provided. [Potential customers be warned, critical thinking cost extra] As previously stated in my initial post, you have to double triple-check all their work. [Tip: make sure to select cc: option on the dashboard to see what is actually being sent to customers]  This whole “Help us help you” is a lame and very unprofessional attempt to push off responsibility instead of improving their service. I wish I could post screenshots of our correspondence showing their response does not correlate with what actually transpired along with notes where their team referred to me as an attorney. To then post here that you found no "confirmation" that I was referred to as an "attorney" is just shameful.    Ignoring your guidance? Gui

*Virtual receptionist service is inconsistent: sometimes doesn't forward calls when available, sometimes misses appointments, gets names and emails wrong.*

> Ruby is good but inconsistent. For example, they do some things well - they pick up the phone, greet clients appropriately, gather information I need, etc. Unfortunately, they don't do this all the time. Sometimes, I set myself to available and they don't put calls through to me. Other times, they don't set an appointment for a new client, don't take detailed enough messages, get names or e-mail addresses for clients wrong, etc. If they could be more consistent I think they could do a much better job, because the employees who do good work do really good work.

*Live chat agent was rude, unqualified, and repeatedly asked same questions; high price doesn't match basic service quality.*

> I am extremely disappointed with Ruby Live Receptionist's service. I recently had a live chat experience with their unqualified representative, and it was a complete disaster. Despite asking a very simple question, I received no helpful answers. Instead, the ruby's live chat agent repeatedly asked the same questions, clearly not paying attention to my responses. This lack of attention and basic comprehension is unacceptable, especially for a service that markets itself as high quality.  The agent was not only ineffective but also rude throughout the interaction. This kind of treatment is frustrating and unprofessional. If Ruby Live Receptionist can't handle their own customer service with competence and courtesy, how can we trust them with our own companies' needs? Given the high price they charge, I expected much better. Sadly, their service falls far below even the most basic standards.

*Phone answering service missed 1 in 5 calls, clients never got the same receptionist, and existing clients were grumpy being met with an answering service instead of someone who knew them*

> Background: General practice solo (rep a ton of businesses, ep, probate, have some govt apppointments as a municipal public defender) in a small town.  I was also a true solo up until a 1.5 ish years ago. To put it shortly I combined a mix of 1 real human employee AND 1 human remote help (after using a phone answering service).  1. I had virtual hq as my call forwarding/phone answering service for a while. They were cost effective (almost too cost effective) and did a so-so job (they missed 1 out of every 5 calls), clients never get the same “receptionist” answering, and I got the feel that existing clients calling the office to speak quickly with me got grumpy when they were met with the answering service. With that said, they were a great, cheap and easy enough to use service, for about a year, when I wasn’t ready to hire anyone (but when I NEEDED some help). Using them allowed me to get my bearings on how to return calls, the flow of not having to rush to return calls when I personally missed them, etc. Without a doubt do not regret using them 1 iota;  2. Using virtual hq got me even busier. So busy I realized I needed someone to filter out the calls, refer out, and accordingly schedule (as you insinuated). I did double midnight moonless ninja recon on using a virtual paralegal………and opted against it. I came to the conclusion that if I was going to hire a remote paralegal for X amount of $ already, I’d rather spend a touch more and get a part time, in office, human being;

> We use Ruby. Not sure if they handle Spanish.   We get about 500 inbound calls per month.   We have 2 internal receptionists, so only the overflow calls go to Ruby. Costs about $700/month depending on volume.   I used Ruby for all my calls when I was first starting out 10 years ago and couldn’t afford staff. It worked. Definitely better than letting calls go to voicemail or using a dial directory.   But people can still tell the difference between someone in-house and the call service. Our conversions are much better since having our own people answer calls. So I would encourage you to work up to that ASAP.

Ultimately no matter how well you set everything up (and you really need to), it’s just random people answering the phone who are not invested in your firm. I would only recommend these services as overflow solutions if you get leads by phone.   If you’re in a practice area that has steady work and doesn’t need to sign clients over the phone a lot, it could be fine.

> When the Agents answer the call, they are not ‘engaging’ with the caller.  The Agents sound very mechanized.  So its a give away this is an answering service. Also, the Agents are not following the Script.  I made two test calls: Call 1: My colleague said he was calling about our services he saw on the web site, and wanted to talk to a Salesperson.  Instead of doing a warm transfer, the Agent considered the caller as a ‘all-else’ category and took a message. Call 2: I said I was responding to a Post Card in the mail about the Free Audit offer.  This time the Agent put me in the right category and tried to do a warm transfer.  I did not answer the call intentionally.  Instead of coming back and taking a message for me, I was on hold for 3 minutes and 23 seconds and the call just dropped.  I will try to modify the scripts and see if I can fix the issues.

Multiple agents have had problem accessing basic information about my business, information that I have given them, and that is publicly available on my website. A caller should never have to wait to find out my prices, my location, or my name/gender. Agents should always be able to use a web browser and log-in credentials. Appointments have been missed because of agent errors that would have been avoided with proper training.  I am also concerned at the lack of transparency their web-portal offers. I've had calls not show up there, I've had calls get mishandled and disappear, I've had phantom appointments booked with very little accountability as to how/why it happened. If I want access to my call recordings, presently I have to ask for them one-by-one and they have to be sent manually. How is one to know there is a problem without being able to freely hear how all calls are being handled?  This should be fixed. All call recordings should be accessible to the business owner and all calls/appointments should produce traceable records in the call log and elsewhere.

*Virtual receptionists pushed callers away by being unable to answer even simple questions like 'Do you have a website?' and couldn't pronounce the company name correctly.*

> I fully expected Ruby’s service to work well for our appointment-setting business, but instead it has been a disservice. Had I not recorded calls and reviewed transcripts, I would never have understood how poorly they were handled. In several cases, their responses actually pushed people away from doing business with us.  If all you need is basic message taking and routing, Ruby may work. But if your callers ask even simple questions—like “Do you have a website?”—it’s too much for them. The result is that your company looks like it doesn’t care and has outsourced calls to people with no investment in your business.  Their sales team and onboarding staff are excellent. But the actual execution of the service is, in my experience, 0 out of 5. Callers couldn’t even pronounce our company name correctly, which leaves a terrible first impression. If the person answering the phone can’t say your name right, what does that say about your business?

*Cosmetic surgery clinic's agents were unprofessional and couldn't handle sensitive medical calls; not bilingual as promised; recordings prove poor quality.*

> Answer Connect is awful. We used them for one week and I could not risk losing prospective or existing patients, who were all appalled at the service. I cannot imagine that the other reviews I have read are true or accurate. Before we signed on, the sales team assured me that they were capable of handling calls from patients for our Cosmetic Surgery clinic. And that the operators were bilingual, English and Spanish. OMG did they mislead us!! I have recordings of 4 of these calls if anyone is interested. I would be happy to forward them to you if you are considering their service.   Feel free to reach out to me at prosenberg1 at Mac dot com. I cancelled the service after hearing these interactions because no amount of additional training or onboarding could possibly fix the problem. Maybe this service is fine for Midas Muffler or some impersonal call center,  but we have patients calling about intimate and embarrassing conditions and listening to the operators made my skin crawl. Upon cancellation, when I played the recordings for the account manager, they first offered me a full refund of the $395 first and only month, and apologized profusely. Then, two days later someone called to tell me that management had only authorized a 50% refund. I know this is not a lot of money, but on principal this simply added insult to injury. The bad impression left by these operators could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars. I ready the Terms of Use policy and clearly AnswerCon

They constantly give the wrong information even when it's not even asked for. For example, a client called and said do you guys install outdoor speakers the lady that answered replied "they don't sell any equipment they only install, so yes they do install outdoor speakers" WRONG! we sell equipment also. When I called my own number to complain the lady that answered got the company name wrong.

Callers expect people to know how to pronounce the business name and to be transferred to the right person 100% of the time. While no one is perfect that's the goal. The service is good and functioning but we don't get much satisfaction from our clients who are put through the service. It seems seem less as you review it.

The response times range from several days to never receiving a reponse.  When I first signed up, from what I can see, the sales person overpromised the capabilities of the service.

### Calls go to the wrong place (5 quotes, 2%)

**#1** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 4/5 | trustpilot

*Sales promised compatibility with Google Voice but calls went to wrong places; technology integration failed; switched to competitor Conversational.*

> Their sales pitch was initially all rainbows and butterflies about being able to work with small businesses who use Google Voice as their business line. After I committed, my phone calls were going all over the place, sometimes to me, sometimes to them, sometimes to voicemail without ever ringing.  They couldn't get it to work and the sales person who pitched me completely changed toned and essentially told me to give up my business number or they had no solution for me. It should be their responsibility to ensure that their technology works with various phone providers, as their entire service is about ease of call forwarding and management. I now have concern for my fellow Google Voicers that they don't realize that some of their calls are not making it to them.  I wanted very much to select Ruby and be able to write a glowing review like the ones that led me to try them, but unfortunately my experience was disappointing to say the least. I am giving two stars simply because the onboarding team and receptionists do genuinely seem nice and act professionally. However, their sales folks would benefit from a deeper understanding of the technology and not make promises that they cannot keep.  I went with Conversational and couldn't be happier.

**#1** | Ruby Receptionist | Quality: 5/5 | trustpilot

*Charged for calls to a recycled phone number unrelated to the business, billed over $30 for internal testing during an upgrade, and lost a day of customer calls due to flawed setup.*

> It is a great service with numerous hiccups.  The number that RUBY assigned me to forward my business numbers to was a fresh change over.  This means I keep getting charged (BY RUBY) for calls made to a prior business (validated as not coming through my VOIP system).  It sucks to be charged for services not related to me.    I have had to contact RUBY sever times for service related issues.  When Upgrading service I was charged over 10 minutes (yeah $30) for their internal testing.  It was only more painful when the internal set-up they were testing was flawed and resulted in a day of lost customer calls.    Yesterday I received a call and as soon as I answered the operator put the call through, no questions, it was an EXTREMELY awkward time to try and take a call that I wanted to be put into voice mail.  Worse was the caller heard me saying "put them into voicemail".  This operator deviated from the protocol used by the other operators.  The app is not so great.  Apparently designed by someone that will never use the service.  Download it and you will see what I mean. No need adding confusion or unclarity-they built it in.    Ruby is a great concept and I expect many issues are related to growing pains.  I have a medium level plan and a VERY SIMPLE configuration.  I cringe to think of the issues if I utilized additional Services.

> We worked with Smith.ai for most of 2025. At first, we enjoyed the support from the live answering service. Unfortunately, the only time I heard from anyone at Smith.ai was when a member called me to upgrade my plan. I told the representative we did not need the extra call volume and he assured me that it would only work out in our favor by changing our plan. Fast forward 4 months later and I realized we were over paying by more than $700 / month. I called the support team (not easy to get someone) and explained the entire situation. The representative was polite and assured me that she would be in touch soon with a resolution. Never heard from her so I called the following week and got a gentleman on the phone this time. He had no record of the lengthy call I had previously had with the female rep. With no resolution I decided it was time to part ways with this dishonest company. Over 5 months they ripped us off for over $3,000. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID BY HIRING THIS COMPANY!  Just read your dishonest reply. If you would listen to the recorded call from May that is not how the conversation went. Also, in November why would you not adjust the plan after I called and asked. That phone call did not exist the next time I had to track down a support person. You need to look at your operations more closely and the dishonest that is being sold to clients. Shame on you.

*Systematic overbilling through opaque 'after-call work' charges; calls lasting 2:20 billed as 5 minutes; hundreds or thousands in overcharges with no transparency.*

> ⭐ 1 out of 5 stars  As a business owner, I trusted AnswerConnect to handle my calls professionally and transparently. Unfortunately, after months of reviewing billing statements and comparing them with my own carrier logs, it became clear that AnswerConnect’s billing practices are questionable and, in my opinion, predatory.  They charge by the minute, yet the actual usage—based on the start and end time of the calls—shows consistent overbilling. In many cases, calls that lasted 2 minutes and 20 seconds were rounded up to 5 minutes. The justification? “After-call work.” But this “after-call work” is untrackable, undefined, and unverifiable by the customer. It opens the door for arbitrary time inflation.  Their Terms of Service quietly mention this “after-call work” count, but they provide no dashboard, no timestamped logs, and no transparency into how long these tasks take or even what they involve.  In my case, I documented dozens of calls where the actual duration was far less than what I was charged, resulting in hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in overcharges. This isn’t just rounding up a few seconds—it’s systematic and feels like a loophole used to exploit business owners who are too busy to check every second.  When I reached out for clarification, I received vague answers and no resolution.  I’ve since left the service and would strongly caution any small business against using AnswerConnect unless they completely change their billing practices and provide full

> We have used answering services for over 15 years for our overflow and after-hours calls. We cancelled service with our last company when they started sending calls overseas. We were looking for a US based company that was on-shore and simple. The usual take a message and we will call you back.  That's what we were sold on with this company. Our rep, Ismael T., was amazing at first. Kind, explained that he used to be one of the virtual receptionists before he went to sales, and that he loved the company and what he did. All things you want to hear.  This service was more expensive than the one we previously had, but we were willing to spend a bit more. Our plan was contracted for 125 minutes at $275 (about $100 more than our previous). Before AnswerConnect, we averaged about 85 minutes per month. The only plans AnswerConnect offered were 75 or 125 minutes, so we figured the 125 would do.  When signing up, Ismael informed me of the promotions. At sign up, the first month was $10 for 300 minutes, and then every month thereafter would be whatever we contracted at. He also let me know that in every month we received 30 free CALLS under 30 seconds. KEEP THIS IN MIND, IT'S IMPORTANT.  First month, thought nothing of it. Again, we used to have about 85 minutes a month, so it my mind, I had nothing to worry about. WRONG. Imagine my surprise when my bill was $360.80, compared to my contracted $275.

*30-40% of calls dropped after switching from Google Voice; Clio integration doesn't work; receptionists clock inflated call times for basic info collection.*

> Let's see, rep misinformed me that if I have Google Voice (GV) then perhaps a very portion of the calls would not connect. After the switch, it became clear that 30-40% of calls were being dropped or not connecting. Solution they proposed was to port over my GV number to Ruby. I did that and quickly found out that I can't use the Ruby app properly as it does not sync up well with Clio. Apparently there is a limitation on how many contacts I can sync up with their platform. Have no idea why they have a limit. Connecting Ruby to Clio does not work properly as it does not fully pull contacts from Clio. On the settings section, there are three dots that are spinning and nothing happens.  So, to make calls I had to manually enter the number and dial out. So backwards and garbage compared to GV app. Now I have to port my number back to GV and come to find out I can't directly do that. I have to first port it to a cell plan, THEN port it to GV. I have already paid GV $3 to port out, now have to pay $20 to port in and who knows how much to get a cell plan to port my original number from Ruby to cell company. It's a giant mess. Aside from that, the receptionists clock in more time than it takes to take in basic information such as name, phone number, email and a brief explanation of what the call is about.

*Bait-and-switch pricing where essential tools are locked behind enterprise plan, plus continued billing after cancellation and non-responsive support*

> ---  **Avoid Synthflow at All Costs – Bait and Switch Nightmare**  Synthflow is the definition of a bait-and-switch scam dressed up as a “tech company.” They lure you in with promises of low rates and simple setup, but the truth only hits after you’ve signed up: the tools you actually need are locked behind their absurdly overpriced enterprise plan. They don’t tell you that up front.  I started small, thinking I’d test the waters. No access to the tools required to actually build a usable flow. I upgraded to their second-highest tier. Still a nightmare. Half the platform is crippled unless you’re on enterprise. Unless you’re an AI engineer, good luck trying to figure out their half-baked system.  Their “tech support” takes over 24 hours to respond. When they do, it’s not with a solution, but with another question—like they didn’t even read what you asked. I went through this loop twice before finally closing my account.  They kept charging me, claiming I didn’t cancel properly. American Express handled that in minutes.  No phone support, no accountability, just excuses. There are plenty of legitimate firms out there who actually answer the phone and deliver what they promise. Don’t waste your time or money here.  Synthflow will run out of VC cash, and when they do, they’ll vanish.  ---

*Enterprise customer paying $2400/month couldn't use batch calling, tags, or promised features for months; promised refund was never processed*

> I was using their Enterprise package for a few months. With Enterprise plan I had 20000 minutes monthly, but because their batch calling didn't work I couldn't use any of it. They keep posting new updates, but their basic functions don't work. For example, if you upload a list of contacts and first and last name ends in a name row. In this case calls cant be made if last name row is empty so you had to do it manually. Also the tag function didn't work for months. We asked for this to be fixed for over 3 months, answer is always the same, it will be done in next run but it never happens. As an enterprise partner we have been promised certain features and integrations with new telephone providers that never happened. Always giving our dates, and it never happened. Besides that there is so many features that are not working, especially their workflows. It takes weeks to fix minor errors. Customer service doesn't exist, even for us who were paying 2400 dollars monthly, you have to beg them over slack to respond. I can imagine for users who pays less. At the end we were promised a refund for the last month because nothing was working. We were told it was processed, and to wait for few days. After that they stopped responding to our messages. Avoid them, save your time, money and nerves. There is so many better software's out there. Extremely dissapointed!

Guys do yourself a favor and find another company...this is run as a joke it seems. Not even answering a client on your top tier plan is just ridiculous.

> If I could give a 0 stars I would. This company at one point was great but in the last year have completely gone down hill. They will charge you for every little thing. And they want to have your card on file so they can charge you randomly. They charged me per their invoice for going over my 200 minute plan and it said I used 172 minutes. They charged me $221 for overage charges for minutes I used that were included in my 200 minute plan. They will turn your service randomly and are 100 percent unreliable. They will promised to credit you for turning off your service and try to charge you anyway. I found a new company and since then realized how much of horrible service I received from them. You will always talk to a different person and they will all have different answers and they will say they will investigate and get back to you to just up charge for the call. Worst answering service!!

*Outsourced agents lacked training; used client minutes for testing; charged for HIPAA and IVR services never received; refused refund.*

> My practice sort service from AnswerConnect and it was horrible. They don't provide the service they advertise. They outsort their service to people out of the country who lack the training. Our staff went through the training and all we requested was not done.   When we inquired why they did answer our call as instructed, we were told by Rayne that they didn't know. They are eager to collect your card and charge it but never provide the service. They use your points to do testing. We signed up for 300 minutes by day 4, 70mins was already used between 6 calls that were ours and 6 calls they had for testing. I reached and shared this observation and we were not credited back those mins. We requested for HIPAA and IVR, they charged for it but we never received those services. We had initially requested 500min before service began, they put 300 mins. That took money for the 500mins. To get my refund, no one would return emails or calls. I would discourages from using their service.

*Charged by the minute while receptionists add unnecessary hold time; billing/customer service never available; billed after cancellation.*

> 1) Ruby has been awful! They charge by the minute. All I wanted them to do was to take messages. Instead, they answer the call, state they are checking to see if am available? 30 seconds later they come back to take a message. It adds up when you get over 200 calls a month. 2. When I called to tell them I was thinking of canceling and would like some information. I was sent information but they went ahead and canceled my phone service w/o my knowledge.  I was out phone service for several days. 3. Try talking to their customer service or billing department. They are never there and you have to leave a message. 2-4 days later they call back! 4. Adding insult to injury, they sent me a bill when I was no longer a client!  They threaten to withdraw the money by direct withdrawal! Of course, the accounting/billing department is not available in this. It has been 2 days and I have not received a phone call or email.

*White-label service failed to remove Synthflow branding and redirected client support tickets to Synthflow, undermining reseller's credibility*

> I entered into an agreement with Synthflow.ai, attracted by their promise of a fully customizable white-label AI voice assistant platform. Their marketing materials and terms suggested that I would be able to rebrand the platform entirely, removing all traces of Synthflow's branding. This was crucial for my business, as I intended to offer this service under my own brand to my clients.​  However, upon implementation, I encountered several issues:  Persistent Synthflow Branding: Despite assurances, Synthflow's logos and branding remained visible throughout the platform, including on client-facing interfaces.​  Support Tickets Redirected to Synthflow: When potential clients submitted support tickets through what was supposed to be my branded platform, they were directed to Synthflow's support channels, undermining the white-label experience.​  Lack of Responsive Support: I reached out to Synthflow's support team multiple times to address these concerns. Unfortunately, their responses were unhelpful, and the issues remained unresolved.​  This experience not only affected my business's credibility but also raised concerns about Synthflow's commitment to their white-label partners. The presence of their branding on my platform confused clients and suggested a direct relationship with Synthflow, which was not the case.​  I advise others considering Synthflow's white-label services to proceed with caution. Ensure you thoroughly test the platform and confirm that all branding can be appropriately customized or removed before making a commitment.​

I quickly realized this wasn’t what we were looking for and canceled but was then contacted by Jorge, an associate at Smith Ai.

We agreed and tried it for a couple weeks but there are just too many kinks needing worked out still.  We ended up losing too many calls.

> (SEE EDIT BELOW) Generally an okay company, but one star for questionable billing practices.  Company continues to bill us even though our service was canceled.  We were promised refunds, but this never happened.  We had to dispute the charges with our credit card company and Smith.ai asked us to withdraw our dispute or they wouldn't refund us.  We have called but can never reach anybody.  Only generic email responses that offer no insight or solutions.  Very disappointed. (EDIT 10/05/23: After leaving this review, the VP of Operations, called me to discuss.  He apologized for the error, but couldn't offer a logical reason as to what happened other than it was his fault and it was missed.  He admitted that refunding is an easy process and couldn't explain what happened other than it did.  He stated that he couldn't refund now that the payment was in a dispute status with our bank, but did offer free months of service with his company for the inconvenience. We declined. I asked why nobody would take my calls before or respond to my messages before when I was asking about my refund and there was no reason offered.  There was no action taken until after I submitted a chargeback and posted this negative review.  If I had not done either of these things, nothing would have happened.

*Service switched off after credit card update; forced to buy new subscription at 3.5x the price to get business line back; left without phone for 35 days.*

> I am typically not the type that will leave a poor review. This company has severely been lacking in their customer service dept this year. They conveniently switched off our lines after getting our updated credit card (within 1.5 weeks we were unaware our last cycle had not gone through). We have used them for going on 3 years and never missed a payment. Someone in billing, not client services wasted my time for 1 hour in a standoff at which time she acknowledged that we were not notified correctly. She refused to reactivate our grandfathered account and said the only way we'd get our business line back was by purchasing their new subscription which was 3.5 x the amount it is worth. We didn't use any live answering for 2022. Just greetings and their lowest monthly plan now start at $350.00/mo now rather than $198 + IVR. The other low reviews are correct, the response time has a lag, and they are extorting our business for more many than they are worth. When you're paying that much and doing all the leg work of recording your own greetings, uploading them, setting up your own profile, and managing the "phone tree" yourself, you start to wonder what kind of crooked business they are running. Save your money and look elsewhere or keep calls internal. We are still actively without a phone line going on 35 days since we cannot get them to help us.

*Law firm grew and Ruby started dropping calls of potential and existing clients; charged for dropped calls; forced to stay 26 more days costing $1,100 after cancellation.*

> I've been a customer for Ruby for a few years.  The service was great when my law firm was small.  As it grew, I noticed that the company was dropping calls of potential clients as well as existing clients.  Ruby Receptionists could never fix the issue, and the company charges you for the dropped calls to add insult to injury.  I ended up switching to an answering service that doesn't charge for dropped calls (which should always be the case).  When I terminated my firm's subscription with Ruby, the company required me to stay in the contract for another 26 days.  They refused to terminate the service the day I cancelled it.  So, effectively, the company gouged me for $1100 for another month of service that was not needed.  Please do not give this company your business.  And talk other people who use their service before agreeing to give them your business.  I heard warnings but ignored them.  UPDATE TO REVIEW on 10/22/25: As you can see below, Ruby has responded with a cut-and-paste review that sounds really nice but will not accomplish anything.  This is the modus operandi of the company.  They are very nice and courteous with their responses, but they don't actually (and never will) fix the problem.  I've already spoken to the necessary account managers at Ruby, and it's the same song and dance (i.e., "We are really sorry, but we're still going to not make it right and take your money").

After the setup, I can't find the things they promoted on the website about the features and capabilities. All things they promoted handled manually, they have not any web panel for managing your service. Also, they charge you for any call they receive, it's mean they receive many calls not related to your business, they will charge you for nothing.

*Billing errors from day one, promised HubSpot/RingCentral integrations didn't work, uncoordinated support; not worth $2,800/month.*

> Our experience with Smith.ai was extremely disappointing and frustrating. The first thing we encountered was issues with billing. During the sale, we were told we wouldn’t be charged for our second month until one month after going live. They did not communicate that to billing and we were charged again.  The dashboard setup was a letdown. Despite repeated requests to remove my personal cell phone number from the dashboard and assurances that it would be removed, it remained, with the excuse that it didn't matter since only we could see it. This negligence in addressing our concerns added to our growing dissatisfaction.  The HubSpot integration that was promised during sales calls turned out to be incompatible with our needs (which we had discussed during the sale). This lack of transparency about the limitations of their service was concerning.  The RingCentral setup instructions provided were inadequate (just a link to a generic RingCentral page that did not address what we were looking for), and when seeking support, we were met with unanswered emails as well as conflicting information. The support staff seemed uncoordinated, and it was incredibly frustrating to be told that Smith.ai didn't actually integrate with RingCentral, despite crystal clear marketing claims to the contrary.  Ultimately, our experience with Smith.ai fell far short of their promises and our expectations and was not at all worth $2800/month. We encountered multiple issues, including billing errors, un

Since Ruby charges per minute once you exceed your plan's alloted time, I find myself wondering why a call that's ostensibly forwarded to voicemail takes 7 minutes of receptionist time... and then, there's no voicemail message left.

> Their front desk will promise phone answering but that doesn’t really happen, we had to forward our Regus number and pay for a separate service it’s so bad. Phone lines and internet went down with slow customer response. They switched payment systems at one point and it stopped our autopay, then gave us late charges. They implemented charges without notifying us, where they charge per minute on phone calls… even though our phone number was forwarding and they weren’t answering the lines. And not cheap per minute. They tried to charge us $10+ for a single local call. My guess is that was probably a 1 hour client consult call. Think of every single call to a law firm costing a few dollars each. It doubled our monthly bill immediately. I could go on, but you get it.  They are a necessary evil for maybe your first year as a new attorney.

I lost another day's worth of calls when they accidentally set our calls for forward ... at a time when no changes were requested on our end or any reason that I can see for anyone to have set it to forward on their end. (After not taking responsibility for the first of these events, they offer absolutely no explanation for the second event in their reply below.)

Simple issues and questions will go literally weeks before being properly answered, but more likely a canned or ai generated email with be received instead.   *Update*  Smith.ai has since done a fantastic job to help correct the issues we were experiencing, specifically when Coralyn and Christene got involved following up and continuing to ensure the accounts are updated and working correctly.

*After 5 years, service deteriorated with failed callbacks costing potentially hundreds of thousands in lost revenue; company only offers $10 credits for major errors.*

> This is now the fourth time the company fail to make a call after telling me that they will. I have lost clients and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars because of this company's negligence. They started off well about 5 years ago but now in the last year they make so many mistakes, and all they do is say oh they won't charge for this call. Will you just lost me potentially thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue and you're going to reimburse me about $10?   As with almost every company this company has gone too big and it did not keep up with this quality at all. Stay far away you will absolutely lose clients if you sign up with this service.

*Ruby's quality nosedived post-2023 after CEO ouster, class action settlement, and system change; every call mishandled; receptionists can't follow basic scripts.*

> For any business owner considering Ruby, I urge you to take the time to read this review and think carefully before working with Ruby. They will damage your brand and cause you a major headache. I have been a loyal Ruby customer for many years, but not anymore. I felt compelled to write this to warn others so their business does not suffer like mine has.  Ruby is taking a nosedive. Many factors, that they hide from the public, are contributing to this. All the positive reviews you have seen for Ruby are pre-2023. All the awards they won, pre-2023. Essentially, since 2023, Ruby has been going under - FAST! And they are dragging their customers with them.  First, Ruby had to settle a class action lawsuit for fraudulent billing. Multi-million dollar payout. I know this since I received a check! Second, they ousted their CEO (Kate Winkler). The company ran smoothly with her at the helm. Once she left, the downfall snowballed. Plus, they also got a new internal system in 2023 that no one at the company knows how to use. What does this mean for you? It means they handle all the calls wrong. Literally, since 2023 not one call has been handled properly for my company. I do not understand how they cannot read a basic script, but literally, they mishandle each call to the point where it is embarrassing. No matter how many times I correct them, walk them through it, they cannot get it right. I have wasted countless hours before finally giving up on them.    I would also like to note tha

*Former fan of Ruby for 3 years; customer service deteriorated, reps hang up on you; simple issues take hours to resolve.*

> I was a big fan of Ruby for the 3 years I have used them, I had even referred several clients to them. I would always brag to everyone how great their customer service was. Unfortunately in the past few months there have been some changes to the company and staffing and there customer service has become horrible. I have sent several request over the past 30 days to get an item resolved which they used to handle in minutes, now you get passed around and once they are frustrated and can't get an answer for you, they just hang up on you. I spent 2 hours on the phone with them trying to get resolved and still nothing. Its very sad to watch such a great company take a nose dive, but I will no longer be using Ruby.com

*Calls going unanswered after 10 rings; clueless receptionist didn't know which company she was answering for; cancelled same day.*

> This service used to be great, now they are completely crap. I had multiple clients tell me that their phone call was never answered, so I called the number myself.   10 rings and no answer.  I called back and got a completely clueless woman on the phone who had no idea what company she was even supposed to be answering the phone for.  I cancelled the service that day.  AVOID!  And their reply below basically says "we know that our service is terrible."  Then a bunch of lip service...  The truth of the matter is that their prices have increased significantly, and the quality of service decreased even more.   Bottom line, this is not a company that anyone with a professional clientele can afford to have facing their customers.

*Previously relied on voicemail with voice-to-text email and customers hated the menu-based system; switching to live receptionist improved communication so much they had to increase minutes twice.*

> We are using Ruby to handle after-hours and weekend calls only. Prior to trying Ruby, we relied on the customer to leave a voicemail. These then went to a voice-to-text email. The system was less than impressive and customers hated using a menu-based system. Since switching to Ruby, our customers appreciate talking to a live person on the first ring. The operators know when to forward a priority call. We've already had to increase our minutes per month and we're maxing that out already. Our communication and outreach to the customer has been great. And the messages we receive are much more detailed than before. We're happy we made this switch.

They match our values of treating every call with kindness and patience.   We are so happy to have found Ruby!
